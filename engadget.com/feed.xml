On top of fast setup, ultra-wideband support offers precision finding (with iPhone 11 and newer) when you&#39;re close — you&#39;ll know just which couch cushion is hiding your keys.

Android users need not apply, and the lack of a hole means you&#39;ll be buying an accessory to clip the AirTag to a keychain or backpack. The year-long battery life will also require that you keep a load of watch batteries on hand. If you don&#39;t see yourself leaving the Apple ecosystem any time soon, though, AirTags are a reasonably safe bet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-four-pack-sale-140051531.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c090d98f-443e-4569-93ea-41361c011e04</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633528963</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:02:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/a537c320-b105-11eb-beff-823d37e1f6ff" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/a537c320-b105-11eb-beff-823d37e1f6ff" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags on a keychain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags on a keychain]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber can track flights and adjust reservations when you're arriving late]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Air traffic is picking back up after dropping dramatically amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and more people need to get from an airport to where they&#39;re going.

This week it’s Nintendo giving the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-nintendo-switch-review.html">OG Switch</a> a makeover, adding an OLED screen and a few other exterior tweaks. But it’s basically the same system on the inside, so don’t call it the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-oled-switch-not-switch-pro-161744624.html">Switch Pro</a>. It’s officially dubbed the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/2YnoQ4D">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, because calling it the “slightly nicer Switch” doesn’t really move units from the shelves. If you’ve already invested in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-nintendo-switch-review-two-years.html">Switch</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-nintendo-switch-lite-review.html">Switch Lite</a> you won’t need the upgrade, but if you’re still Switch-less this is the model to buy.</p><p>It’s $50 more than the original, which is not being pulled from shelves just yet. For $350, the new Switch has a full 7-inch OLED screen, a step up from the older model’s 6.2-inch display. The larger screen size is appreciated, though after six hours of playing it in handheld mode I didn’t notice the difference as much.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/aef798b0-261a-11ec-adc7-fb56dc1e1566" alt="OG Switch and OLED model" data-uuid="383fb5d0-8dc4-3541-89f2-a39dc0074ae3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>What did catch my attention when I switched back to the original were the chunky bezels around the 6.2-inch display. I’ve never liked them and found them to be one of the least attractive things about the system. Now they make me recoil in disgust when I compare them to the OLED model’s slim lines, which have been whittled to a third of the size. The matte plastic frame around the screen has also shrunk and changed to a glossy plastic, making it even less obtrusive.</p><p>As for the display itself: yes, it is noticeably brighter. There’s enough of a difference that in my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-hands-on-130019060.html">initial hands-on</a> I was dismayed when I returned to my personal Switch at home hours later. When placed side by side, the difference is undeniable. The colors pop just a bit more, the blacks are deeper and the whites are… more white, with the original having a slight lavender tint in contrast to the purer white of the OLED screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8e3d7400-261a-11ec-bfff-1153d1e59a6f" alt="Metroid Dread on the screen" data-uuid="73e97f68-8934-3d3d-9450-a82fba8402ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>While not every game will benefit from better colors, Nintendo is also releasing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/2WOD6Dm"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> the same day. Like all titles in the series, the game traffics in a lot of dark spaces, with the bright pop of Samus’ red and yellow (or blue) armor contrasting nicely alongside backgrounds of brown and gray. It’s a good showcase for the OLED’s improved color fidelity and just a nice-looking game in general, which distracts from the fact that the new Switch doesn’t bring any actual improvements under the hood.</p><p>The CPU and GPU go unaltered, which ensures that all future Switch titles remain compatible with existing Switch and Switch Lite systems. This is pretty much in keeping with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-boy-advance-20th-anniversary-150023359.html">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-3ds-10th-anniversary-games-160019952.html">3DS</a> lines of products, which saw some radical redesigns like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/game-boy/micro/">Game Boy micro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/2ds">2DS</a> over their lifespans. Sure, there were handhelds like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/DSi/">DSi</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds.html">New 3DS</a> that came with improved internal specs, but those never saw widespread adoption. The Switch OLED is a lot more like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/game-boy/advance/sp/">Game Boy Advance SP</a>: significant improvements to the display and form factor, but the same old library of games.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5f3c07a6ff91476d9e8e42a277c6cae6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/01c34670-261b-11ec-9ff9-7ae578fac53e" alt="GBA SP, DS Lite, 3DS XL, Switch, Switch OLED"></section><p>Alongside that new display are a bunch of minor tweaks that don’t seem like much when considered individually, but as a whole really improve the experience. The most notable is the new stand on the back. The one on the original Switch is small and roughly a finger’s width, with only two positions: open and closed. The one on my original launch unit no longer locks in the “closed” position and has a tendency to flop out when I’m playing in handheld mode. It also detaches completely if you look at it funny.</p><p>The Switch OLED’s stand is an entirely different beast. Instead of a skinny little strip, it’s now a Microsoft Surface-style panel that stretches across the back of the entire unit, with real hinges that can be left in a number of positions so you can now put your unit at whatever angle you prefer. I wouldn’t try to pull this thing off; the hinges are actually molded into the plastic, so if you do break it, it’ll have to go off to the Nintendo repair shop to get fixed up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b0bdf80-261b-11ec-93d7-3651390a7516" alt="Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED, face down" data-uuid="a90e348a-e0aa-3056-ad4f-0f17f422a93e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>To accommodate the new stand a bunch of stuff has been moved around on the back of the Switch unit. The logo is now printed on the stand itself, so it’s been moved to the lower half of the rear. The manufacturing info, like the parts number and voltage, is now printed in black on the black plastic, underneath the stand. So it’s doubly hidden — a subtle but welcome improvement. The rear speakers have been moved to the bottom edge of the unit, where they also serve as a way to pull the stand out. It’s actually very thoughtful, while providing clear game audio and minimizing system noise. And, while the microSD hasn’t been completely relocated, it’s now placed parallel to the bottom edge. I assume this small change is to keep users from accidentally pulling out the card when they’re trying to adjust the stand. The one thing that hasn’t been relocated is the USB-C port on the bottom, so you still can’t recharge it in tabletop mode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6651cf20-261c-11ec-9bd7-e672b3c5ea6f" alt="Face down, bottom pointed at camera" data-uuid="506c15f4-a8f0-366b-9d8a-7fb9995382c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are fewer changes to the device’s top edge, with the most notable being a button redesign resulting in longer, thinner power and volume switches. The new buttons aren’t easier to hit, but they do look sleeker and feel better under my fingers thanks to the textured plastic of the Switch OLED. The system is actually just nicer to hold now, like when it kept the sweat from pooling under my clammy hands during a particularly stressful boss fight in <em>Metroid Dread</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2ac8330-261b-11ec-89ff-780e38f8c134" alt="Metroid Dread on screen, Joy-Cons in front" data-uuid="3b644227-dcb5-371e-befd-342524da783b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Because the Switch OLED has to be compatible with all existing accessories, that means the unit is the same height and width as the original model. The Joy-Cons haven’t gotten a redesign, but hopefully the infamous “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-president-apologizes-joy-con-drift-161644217.html">Joy-Con drift</a>” has been eradicated by now. The new black and white color scheme is very nice, a step up from my all-gray launch unit in terms of style. If you like a more playful color palette, the Switch OLED can also be bought with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED red and blue" href="https://amzn.to/3DtAYRd">red and blue Joy-Cons</a>, or you can swap any other Joy-Cons you want. But the white ones don’t show scratches as easily as the other shades, so they’ll look spiffy for longer.</p><p>The one change in the system’s dimensions is the weight, thanks to the OLED screen. When handling the original and new Switch side by side, the difference is undeniable. But it’s not a big enough divide to make the Switch OLED less portable in any way. Subjectively, it might actually seem a bit lighter, possibly because the weight is well-distributed. The one thing about the build that feels like a step down is that the OLED model has a tiny bit of flex in the middle of the rear panel that’s not present in the original. However, it doesn’t make much of a difference to the build quality unless you’re planning to take a hammer to the back of the unit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c615c250-261b-11ec-bf6d-ef569e96d4b3" alt="Face down, on a stack of games" data-uuid="5dcbe3cd-7fcf-3285-92ec-77563bb0fb94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Because the system keeps the same internals, that means the battery has gone unchanged as well. It’s the same as the refreshed 2019 battery, which offers between four and nine hours of battery life compared to the launch unit’s cap of six hours.  However, the new OLED should be more power-efficient than the LCD, and in use it appears to be. I got almost seven hours of <em>Metroid Dread</em> before I got the “low battery” warning at 15 percent, and that’s a game that makes frequent use of vibration. Compare that to the four or five hours I tend to get out of my OG Switch, even when playing something fairly tame like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-switch.html"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-gaming-irl-untitled-goose-game.html"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>.</p><p>If you already have an existing Switch, you can drop the OLED model into your current dock and it will work just fine. But the system does come with its own, redesigned dock that you might want to set up. It looks a lot nicer thanks to its rounded corners and glossy black plastic on the inside (which admittedly will probably scratch up over time). The back panel isn’t great, as it feels flimsy and can come off completely (so you may lose it). But all of these are outweighed by the important addition of an ethernet port.</p><section data-eng-breakout="a3dc9844ee064bba99a8475831c25d8c" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb356400-261b-11ec-b5f7-5fe1742760c7" alt="rear of dock, closed" data-uuid="8c8bda87-4ffd-3326-8eec-027d283d7f03"></section><p>Prior to this, the Switch has always been intended as a wireless system, and it hasn’t been stellar. Early models had a tendency to “forget” how to connect to your WiFi, forcing you to restart the system. And even now, downloading from the Nintendo eShop can be pokey; even with the OLED model I had to leave my system sitting for an hour or two while it downloaded games wirelessly. But now you can just plug in a cable for a faster, more reliable connection. If you have one in your living room, that is. Many people don’t, which makes this a feature for the more technical-minded fans. It’s the one new feature of the Switch OLED that I would consider “pro” level, and if you have a place to plug in it’s certainly worth the $50 premium.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c50fce90-261c-11ec-8ffb-bedf7b09424a" alt="with back panel open" data-uuid="68f0548e-b856-37d3-bfeb-35b2eaea40e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Overall, the Switch OLED is a nice system coming out at an odd time, as it’s been over four years since the release of the original Switch. Based on Nintendo’s past release history, that would indicate a new console some time around 2023. So it’s a big ask of people to buy a $350 system if something better is just around the corner. (<a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819">Nintendo has categorically denied that it has plans for a new Switch</a> as recently as last week, but that doesn’t preclude that one will come out eventually.)</p><p>There’s also the specter of the Steam Deck in December, just two short months from now (assuming no delays). It&#39;s far more powerful than the Switch, and is also much larger, but promises access to almost the entire Steam library, which happens to overlap with the current Nintendo eShop quite a bit. The biggest selling point for the Switch OLED is access to storied franchises like Mario and Zelda, as well as the incredible bargain that is Switch Online. But you don’t need an OLED screen or wired ethernet to enjoy old NES, SNES, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-n64-genesis-online-new-plan-223038490.html">N64 and Genesis</a> titles.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a9e6fcb0-261c-11ec-b677-e740eb1dca4f" alt="Switch OLED turned off" data-uuid="340d79c4-8d60-3ec6-83ac-da88d5ef440e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re not going to be able to plug it into ethernet, or don’t need better speeds because you play offline all the time, the choice to upgrade to a Switch OLED is tricky. If you always play on the TV, there’s absolutely no point in buying this one, as there’s no difference in the dock’s output quality. It’s going to look the same as it always has, as this is most definitely not the rumored upgrade to 4K. But even if you’re a handheld player it’s not a must-have, unless you’ve given up on your original Switch because you just really, really hate LCD displays, or absolutely need more than five hours of battery life.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37c8630a-06df-4f1e-bd1a-bfbb911bab0e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633525322</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T13:02:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samus Aran in a save point]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alphabet's Wing tests drone deliveries from shopping center rooftops in Australia]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet subsidiary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-alphabet-wing-drone-delivery-service-australia.html">Wing</a> has launched a pilot program that will have its drones fly products from the rooftops of shopping centers. In fact, it has already started the program in its biggest market, Logan, Australia. The subsidiary has teamed up with Australian retail property group, Vicinity Centres, to test the new model at Logan&#39;s Grand Plaza, where Wing&#39;s drones have been flying orders to customers from businesses directly below their launching pad.&nbsp;</p><p>Wing has been operating in Logan over the past two years, but up until now, businesses have had to co-locate their products at the company&#39;s delivery facility. This is the first time the subsidiary is conducting deliveries from participating merchants&#39; existing location instead. Wing has been flying its drones from the rooftop of Grand Plaza since mid-August, delivering sushi, bubble tea, smoothies and other products from merchants in the shopping center. Starting today, the drones will also deliver over-the-counter medicine and personal care and beauty products.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within the first six weeks of operating from the Grand Plaza, Wing&#39;s drones have already made 2,500 deliveries to several Logan suburbs. The Alphabet company plans to expand not just its partner merchants in the center, but also its delivery coverage area. Jesse Suskin, Wing’s Head of Policy &amp; Community Affairs in Australia, also said that if the Grand Plaza pilot is successful, the company can &quot;potentially roll out similar models in other locations across Vicinity Centres’ retail property portfolio.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While it remains to be seen whether the Grand Plaza pilot will lead to rooftop deliveries from more Vicinity locations, Wing has been quite successful in Logan. It has already made more than 50,000 deliveries in the city this year alone and has celebrated its 100,000th delivery overall last August.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/071812c0-269a-11ec-bfdf-094f1cc58eeb" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Wing" data-uuid="3e37ff39-e24c-3d8d-8c92-e92dbe28b14e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wing</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-shopping-center-rooftops-pilot-130022044.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a97df23-08ee-433c-b637-4bb0c2a84bc8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633521211</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T11:53:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae07fd90-2693-11ec-afef-627c01a334e8" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae07fd90-2693-11ec-afef-627c01a334e8" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wing]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alphabet Wing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alphabet Wing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch's source code and streamer payment figures have been leaked in apparent hack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hackers claim to have accessed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch">Twitch</a> and leaked a vast amount of company data, including proprietary code, creator payouts and the &quot;entirety of Twitch.tv.&quot; <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-entirety-of-twitch-has-reportedly-been-leaked/"><em>Video Games Chronicle</em></a> has reported that Twitch is aware of the breach, according to the attackers, but has yet to respond publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of of the Twitch.tv code, the attackers said they stole the the site&#39;s mobile, desktop and console Twitch clients.

The theme park is effectively doubling down on its Nintendo-related attractions in the park, following the opening of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-world-japan-will-open-in-the-spring-of-2021-081022899.html">Super Nintendo World</a> and the announcement of a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-world-confirms-donkey-kong-expansion-080206819.html">Donkey Kong</a> expansion.&nbsp;</p><p>There aren&#39;t a lot of details about the project, but the companies said that they&#39;ve formed a &quot;long-term strategic alliance and that multiple development projects are underway.&quot; Whatever they build, it will involve &quot;outstanding creativity&quot; and &quot;world-class entertainment technology,&quot; according to the enthusiastic press release.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pokémon Company is technically separate from Nintendo, though Nintendo does own a big chunk of it.

To that end, it&#39;s likely that a Pokémon park would appear in the US, too.</p><p>Lest you&#39;ve forgotten, the Universal Pokémon expansion wouldn&#39;t technically be the first Poké-related theme park. <em>Pokémon The Park,</em> aka <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9park"><em>PokéPark</em></a>, was a traveling Japanese theme park that ran in 2005 and 2006 in Japan and Taiwan.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/universal-studios-japan-partners-with-pokemon-on-new-in-park-entertainment-103504372.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce0e4415-043b-4d0a-bec6-c2cfd107bf76</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 10:35:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633516167</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T10:29:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a099d060-268a-11ec-b7dd-cbde9a7eae74" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a099d060-268a-11ec-b7dd-cbde9a7eae74" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[John Gress/Corbis via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Universal Studios Japan partners with Pokémon on 'new in-park entertainment']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Universal Studios Japan partners with Pokémon on 'new in-park entertainment']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon opens its first 4-star store outside the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.co.uk/shopping-and-entertainment/amazon-4-star-opens-in-the-uk-marking-its-first-international-expansion">opened</a> a 4-star store in Bluewater, a mall located just southeast of central London. And it&#39;s not just the first 4-star store outside the US, it&#39;s also the company&#39;s first shop in the UK that sells non-food and non-perishable items. Similar to Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-amazon-4-star.html">4-star stores in New York</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-amazon-4-star-store-colorado.html">other parts</a> of the US, the shop in Bluewater will sell products rated 4 stars and above, are top sellers or are trending on the e-commerce giant&#39;s UK website.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the shop can&#39;t carry all the highly rated products Amazon sells online, the selection in-store will be curated, though they will include goods across top categories like consumer electronics, toys, games, books, kitchen and home. It will sell products from small businesses across the UK, as well as the company&#39;s own devices, including Kindle e-Readers, Fire tablets and Echo speakers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shop will have sections that correspond to specific sections of the website, as well, such as Most Wished For, which will feature products from Wish Lists. &quot;Trending in Bluewater&quot; will showcase items local customers have been buying, while &quot;Most Gifted&quot; will feature the top items ordered as gifts. Amazon says it will switch out products regularly based on customer feedback and to keep up with the latest trends.&nbsp;</p><p>Products in the store will be marked with digital tags containing the item&#39;s price, average star rating and the number of customer reviews. In addition, customers don&#39;t have to be Prime members to be able to shop there. That said, the store won&#39;t feature Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out technology like the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-go-store-uk-084721065.html">Fresh grocery store</a> in London. Just Walk Out allows shoppers to grab what they need from the shelves and, well, walk out without having to pay at a manned or a self-checkout counter. They can make their purchase from Amazon&#39;s UK website, however, and simply pick up their order from the store the next day.</p><div id="2984644f3d7a49ac83cd4398d5d84028"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⭐ ⭐ EXCITING NEWS!⭐ ⭐ <br>We&#39;re SO excited for Amazon 4-star to be opening here at Bluewater today - the first store of its kind in the UK!<br>Visit the brand new store to discover thousands of top-rated products including Amazon devices, smart home accessories, books and more. 🤩 <a href="https://t.co/jaXFndilyQ">pic.twitter.com/jaXFndilyQ</a></p>— Bluewater (@TweetBluewater) <a href="https://twitter.com/TweetBluewater/status/1445686421142994950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-4-star-store-outside-us-100545112.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">684df1ce-61c2-492d-b964-a1be94c1abd0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 10:05:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633513962</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T09:52:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a1f68b0-2681-11ec-9fcf-d539814c5692" width="1042" height="650" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e0f22270-268a-11ec-aeff-318fdf82170a" width="1600" height="1021" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber to face UK tribunal over 'racially discriminatory' facial recognition systems]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Drivers in the UK are taking legal action against Uber over its real-time biometric identification checks, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/05/uber-faces-legal-action-over-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-id-checks/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> has reported. A union representing the drivers claims that some members were wrongly suspended when they were misidentified, and lost their licenses as a result. &quot;[The] facial recognition systems... are inherently faulty and generate particularly poor accuracy results when used with people of color,&quot; the App Drivers &amp; Couriers Union (ADCU) wrote in a <a href="https://www.adcu.org.uk/news-posts/adcu-initiates-legal-action-against-ubers-workplace-use-of-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-systems">blog post</a>.</p><p>Backed by two worker&#39;s rights groups, the union is <a href="https://www.crowdjustice.com/case/challenge-ubers-facialrec/">crowdfunding</a> the legal action, taken on behalf of former UberEats courier Pa Edrissa Manjang and former Uber driver Imran Javaid Raja.

That came about because of a lawsuit filed on behalf of two Uber drivers, James Farrer and Yaseen Aslam, who eventually helped form the ADCU in February 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-uber-london-license-revoked-transport.html">pulled Uber&#39;s license</a> in 2019 over &quot;a pattern of failures.&quot; One particular sore point was that it allowed uninsured and suspended drivers to operate in the city, due to a loophole allowing them to upload their photos to another driver&#39;s account. To meet the regulator&#39;s requirements, Uber introduced random driver checks via a facial recognition system that uses Microsoft&#39;s FACE API technology, according to the ADCU. (Uber <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-transport-london-licence-court-appeal-decision-100537691.html">won back</a> its license in September of 2020.)</p><p>The union noted that Microsoft withdrew sales of its facial recognition software to US police departments, and that the use of similar software has been discontinued or banned by Amazon, IBM, Axon and other companies. It also cited stats showing that facial recognition programs are far less accurate for people of color.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Uber pushed back, saying that it doesn&#39;t depend solely on AI. &quot;Our Real-Time ID Check is designed to protect the safety and security of everyone who uses the Uber app by helping ensure the correct driver is behind the wheel,&quot; Uber responded in a statement to TechCrunch. &quot;The system includes robust human review to make sure that this algorithm is not making decisions about someone’s livelihood in a vacuum, without oversight.&quot; It added that no Uber or Uber Eats accounts is suspended solely as a result of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Farrer said that the union has won at least 10 appeals in court against drivers dismissed by TfL that cite Uber&#39;s ID checks. &quot;With Imran [Javaid Raja], Uber and TfL have already admitted they got it wrong. But he was out of work for three months. No apology. No compensation,”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-drivers-take-legal-action-over-racially-discriminatory-facial-recognition-093531420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab811101-8000-42fa-9888-d41c8adf8060</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 09:35:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633523603</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T12:33:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c75aa750-267c-11ec-bfbd-15c1d2d75879" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c75aa750-267c-11ec-bfbd-15c1d2d75879" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRISTOL, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/08/15: An UBER car seen parked on the street in Bristol.

Now, HMD/Nokia have launched their first tablet together, the 10.4-inch T20, with the key features being a large battery, cheap price and US availability.</p><p>The T20 isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call a beautiful tablet, given the plain-Jane design and chunky bezels, though it does have a solid metal body structure and relatively thin (7.8mm) and light (470g) profile. The screen also looks pretty nice on paper, with 2K (2,000 x 1,200) resolution and 400 nits of brightness.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/928f4480-2673-11ec-bfff-de0e1d582fdd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="1a12ef8d-0a13-33b2-a9dc-f570b57f62b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nokia</div></figure><p>The key feature is the battery, though. With an 8,200mAh (non-removable) cell, it will let you surf the web for 15 hours between charges, play video for 10 hours or do Zoom-type calls for seven hours. It also comes with relatively fast charging (15 watts), though the charger in the box outputs just 10 watts.</p><p>Other specs are about what you&#39;d expect for a tablet in this price category, including a Tiger T610 8-core CPU, up to 4GB of RAM/64GB of storage (expandable), and an 8-megapixel rear camera/5-megapixel front camera. There&#39;s optional LTE as well, though Nokia didn&#39;t say how much extra that would cost.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a8f11870-2673-11ec-a5ef-5b909e84030f" style="height:1337;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="95bdb032-2841-3d76-abf0-8548df3ff479"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Giacomo Mantovani</div></figure><p>For what it is, $250 price looks pretty decent. However, the world of Android tablets is an unremarkable one — will Nokia&#39;s brand recognition matter? The Nokia T20 arrives to the US and elsewhere around the world tomorrow (October 7th).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hmd-and-nokias-first-tablet-has-a-humongous-battery-090021037.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">302cb242-7577-4ca6-b4a4-8c20806570fb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 09:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633504221</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T07:10:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ed3eaf0-266b-11ec-8f8e-c7ce669cf2a1" width="2000" height="1319" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ed3eaf0-266b-11ec-8f8e-c7ce669cf2a1" width="2000" height="1319" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HMD]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HMD and Nokia's first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HMD and Nokia's first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile wireless home internet service now costs $10 less]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile has <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/home-internet-big-fee-deal">slashed</a> $10 off the wireless home internet service it launched in April.

They&#39;d have to install it themselves, but the carrier says it will take them as little as 15 minutes.

Taking the turn-by-turn functionality that Maps is known for, the tool allows you to see important details about your current trip without the need to keep your phone’s screen turned on. You also don’t need to enter the full turn-by-turn interface to use the feature. At a glance, it will also allow you to see your current ETA and any changes in elevation.</p><p>Google announced the introduction of lite navigation as part of a broader effort related to sustainability. So as you might imagine, it’s not the only cycling-related announcement the company had.

Like Google&#39;s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt pointed out at a media event yesterday, they&#39;re also bad for the environment and public health. The company unveiled a slew of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html">sustainability-centric products</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-sustainability-travel-shopping-070110212.html">updates today</a> that aim to help users make more informed, environmentally friendly decisions. But it&#39;s also been working on a project that could use AI to make traffic lights more efficient and, as a result, decrease pollution in general.&nbsp;</p><p>When your vehicle stops at an intersection, that idling time leads to wasted fuel and &quot;more street-level air pollution,&quot; Brandt said. Google&#39;s new project would use AI to measure and calculate traffic conditions and timing at a city&#39;s intersections, then time them more efficiently. Brandt said one of the company&#39;s AI research groups has been able to accurately calculate and gather this data and train a model to optimize inefficient intersections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has run pilots at four locations in Israel to date, in partnership with the municipalities of Haifa, Beer-Sheva and the Israel National Roads Company. The company says it&#39;s observed a &quot;10 to 20 percent reduction in fuel and intersection delay time&quot; so far. Google didn&#39;t share any details on the average daily traffic in those intersections, though a video clip from the event showed a fairly busy junction. The company also didn&#39;t explain how the AI would work with current systems and the lights around specific intersections.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s early days,&quot; Brandt said, &quot;but on the back of these promising results, we are now beginning new pilots in Rio de Janeiro and speaking with other cities around the globe.&quot; Though we&#39;re likely still at least years away from having AI manage <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/12/engineers-who-hacked-in-la-traffic-signal-computers-jamming-traffic-sentenced.html">our traffic intersections</a>, this is one of the steps towards the vision of completely smart cities that the industry has collectively been working on for years.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of letting AI decide when to let vehicles stop or go can seem unsettling at best and potentially risky, but the goal of improving traffic light efficiency is a worthwhile one. Hopefully, with rigorous testing and safety measures in place, we may actually be able to reduce a significant amount of wasted fuel and exhaust-based pollution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-traffic-lights-research-environment-pollution-070132356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38eee67a-2d14-4c53-a3b5-8f5369e5b285</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633469840</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T21:37:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration demonstrating how Google's AI could optimize traffic lights at an intersection.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google AI Traffic Light research project]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest Renew program can help you use more clean energy at home]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s latest effort to help you make more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-minecraft-sustainability-report-map-154637717.html">environmentally friendly</a> decisions is all about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-texas-storm-power-grid-133029237.html">your power grid</a>. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/nest-renew-clean-energy/">new Nest Renew program</a> is a suite of features that look at the times of day when the electricity feeding into your home is cleaner and turning your compatible Nest thermostats on or off accordingly. Renew arrives in a by-invitation preview in the coming weeks, and will be available for free in the continental US when it launches publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>At the heart of Nest Renew is the understanding that at any given time, the power grid in your neighborhood contains a mix of clean and traditional energy. In the early afternoon, perhaps, there could be a higher concentration of electricity from solar sources, while a windier day could mean more power from turbines is coming through. Depending on the region, power grids could be getting their electricity from a diverse mix of sources. According to Nest product manager Jeff Gleeson, &quot;a smart dynamic electric grid really needs smart homes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nest Renew will not only automate some of this decision-making for you, but it can also give you insights on the type of power coming into your home. First, a new feature called Energy Shift will let those with a Google account and compatible Nest Thermostat automatically activate heating or cooling during times when your grid is cleaner.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f764610-2616-11ec-9eff-db5273d5851a" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="A sample of the Monthly Impact Report from Google&#39;s new Nest Renew Program on a laptop screen." data-uuid="89dc9725-ea94-3e77-a3d1-19943326816e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Because Google can now see how carbon-intense a grid is, it can start cooling, say, earlier in the day when solar energy is more available (and your home is approaching your temperature limit). Gleeson told Engadget that the company doesn&#39;t think people will notice a difference with this change, and stresses that &quot;customers are always in control.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If your thermostat kicks in before you want it to, you can always dial it back down, and you&#39;ll know the device is making a Renew-related decision thanks to a green leaf that will appear onscreen. For those whose energy provider charges based on time-of-use, this can also help you save money.</p><p>Nest has had the leaf symbol on its product for years as an indicator of more power-efficient temperature control. Now, you can earn leafs by doing things like using Energy Shift, joining monthly challenges to do things like running your laundry on cold. When you accumulate enough leafs to hit milestones, you can vote where Google sends its funds (from a list of its Energy Impact partners starting with non-profits <a href="https://gridalternatives.org/">GRID Alternatives</a> and <a href="https://www.elevatenp.org/">Elevate</a>).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e5f4270-2617-11ec-bbfb-c3e15b488e17" style="height:2000;width:2000;" alt="A Nest Thermostat showing the message " data-uuid="5da1ee04-4396-36b2-9fd7-fa93c2147b7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In addition to automatic adjustments via your thermostat, Nest Renew will provide monthly &quot;impact reports&quot; that not only tell you the difference you&#39;re making, but also display when the electricity coming into your home is greener. With this data, you can choose to run the laundry, dishwasher or charge your devices earlier or later when your grid is cleaner.</p><p>Renew is a free opt-in program and works with the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-31-nest-thermostat-e.html">Nest Thermostat E</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-thermostat-2020-redesign-google-home-130-specs-pre-order-140039186.html">most recent Nest Thermostat</a>. Google is also offering a Premium tier for $10 a month in select parts of the US. It will unlock a Clean Energy Match feature that will exchange renewable energy credits (RECs) for what it estimates to be the same amount of fossil fuel-based electricity you use at home each month. This way, even if clean energy isn&#39;t available when you need to use it, you can at least assuage your guilt over using non-renewable power. Premium members will also get a unified bill that shows their monthly subscription to the program as well as their usual utility charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Gleeson said Nest has been working on this program for years, and in that time it has teamed up with utilities and energy providers to encourage enrollment in residential programs, among other things. For Nest Renew, it&#39;s teamed up with eight <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-glimpse-into-the-derms-vendor-ecosystem-and-solutions">Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS)</a> providers to help shape the program to meet their respective zero-carbon goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Nest Thermostats, increased visibility and marketing and relevant rewards programs, Google hopes to get more people enrolled  in green energy utilities offers and programs. The company also wants to help utilities &quot;bring more renewables online&quot; and accelerate the process either by supporting them in building or buying renewable infrastructure, according to head of energy partnerships Hannah Bascomb.</p><p>Google&#39;s slew of sustainability-minded announcements today demonstrate a continued commitment towards the &quot;carbon-free future&quot; that CEO Sundar Pichai wrote about <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future/">a year ago</a>. In what Pichai called &quot;our third decade of climate action,&quot; Google plans to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7, help more than 500 cities reduce 1 gigaton of carbon emissions and enable its partners to reduce carbon emissions all by 2030. Nest Renew is a part of a wide-ranging set of updates today across Search, Maps and more to help Google&#39;s users make more-informed, environmentally friendly decisions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74bad9e0-cc4a-4976-a457-6b8aa73fbabe</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633466210</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T20:36:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person using their right index finger to adjust the temperature on a Nest Thermostat, which shows the temperature at 74 degrees on its screen.

Its aim is nothing less than to transform virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) production by making workflow simpler than current VR capture systems, while delivering the quality of a full-frame mirrorless camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The key product is the $1,999 RF5.2mm F2.8 L Dual Fisheye manual lens designed specifically to mount on Canon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">8K-capable EOS R5</a> camera. It&#39;s a highly unusual looking product, to say the least, with two bulging fisheye lenses mounted side by side. They&#39;re placed approximately 60mm (2.4 inches) apart to match human interpupillary distance and provide comfortable parallax for VR and AR.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/aa5daa20-265a-11ec-9dde-f26d15ab7d47" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a58436c1-ff22-3d47-ba29-b503f8e8749f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens works only with Canon&#39;s EOS R5, chosen for its 8K video capability. When shooting, it projects two circular images onto the camera&#39;s 45-megapixel sensor. It supports 190-degree capture, allowing for delivery of stereoscopic 180-degree 3D footage or photos at up to 8,192 x 4,096 (8K) resolution for AR or VR applications.&nbsp;</p><p>The lens has some unusual features, like a ring that focuses both lenses at once and an Allen screw adjustment that lets you tweak the focus of one lens to precisely match the other. Otherwise, you get features typically found in high-end Canon L RF mount glass, like coatings to control flare and ghosting, dust and water-resistant sealing and a solid F2.8 to F16 aperture range. Despite the odd looks, the lens is fairly compact and not much larger than Canon&#39;s 35mm F1.8 lens.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68668a40-265c-11ec-bcd7-232376631f48" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system" data-uuid="bf7dbb3d-bb68-3e8d-a249-a88954385a5c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens is just one part of the equation, though.

That includes MF peaking and manual focus confirm via Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel autofocus system, along with a &quot;Magic Window&quot; UI that helps users plan for delivery to different types of headsets.</p><p>In addition, Canon made its own EOS VR Utility and EOS VR Plugin apps, each available by subscription for $5 per month (with a free trial period). The VR Utility app flips the stereo images left to right and converts them from circular to an &quot;equirectangular&quot; square image that can be viewed on a VR headset. It also offers quick editing tools like trimming of clips and application of a LUT, while letting you change to preset resolutions and file types (DPX, Pro Res, H264, etc.) prior to export.</p><div id="6df67d3f53124c17a9e391b2e55bc302"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJAr7SbVGBg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There&#39;s also the EOS VR plug-in for Adobe Premiere that &quot;will convert the dual fisheye imagery to equirectangular, while allowing the ability to cut, color, and edit with the full control of Premiere Pro,&quot; Canon told Engadget. It also lets you export footage to the desired spec for different types of delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of those apps, you&#39;ll be able to use the current Camera Connect app and Canon&#39;s EOS Utility to control capture. Both will be updated down the road to offer &quot;remote control live view functionality for monitoring purposes while on-the-go,&quot; Canon said in a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/20211006-product/20211006-product">press release</a>.</p><p>The system can be used for weddings, journalism, sports, training, events and more, while offering a number of advantages over current VR cameras. To start with, it&#39;s designed to deliver better quality than standalone VR cameras with smaller lenses and sensors like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-21-insta360-pro-2-8k-3d-vr-flowstate-stabilization.html">$5,000 Insta360 Pro 2</a>. At the same time, you get all the R5&#39;s tools like log shooting, RAW capture, 10-bit video and more. And when you&#39;re not using the VR lens, the R5 can be used for regular video production or photo shoots, unlike dedicated VR cameras.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/768e1d60-265a-11ec-a57f-7e26368f01f2" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a37a1b52-d134-3e8a-80aa-578b74ea69ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>At the same, the production process is simpler and cheaper than with dual cameras used in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-live-nba-is-coming-to-googles-vr-platform.html">higher-end productions</a>. Those cameras must be rigged, synced, focused and positioned correctly, with the end result being two files in many cases. Canon&#39;s EOS VR system, by contrast, delivers similar quality but offers focus and setup like a regular camera, while leaving you with a single file to edit at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire system isn&#39;t exactly cheap, considering you need to pay $1,999 for the lens and $3,899 if you don&#39;t already have an R5 camera, for a total of $5,898. However, considering how niche and unusual the lens is, it costs less than I expected. There&#39;s also the issue of R5 overheating that limits 8K recording times to 20 minutes, with a 10-minute recovery period. You can <a href="https://ymcinema.com/2021/08/29/canon-eos-r5-overheating-test-passed-more-than-1-5-hours-of-8k-raw-recording-time/">improve that</a> by capturing 8K to an external Ninja V+ RAW recorder, but that&#39;ll add $1,500 to your cost.</p><p>Still, it looks very promising for VR production, which has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/04/virtual-reality-usage-booms-in-the-workplace-amid-the-pandemic.html">boomed in popularity</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic (though still isn&#39;t exactly mainstream). It&#39;s been especially in-demand for business training and collaboration, a potentially rich vein for video producers. A lot of those folks, especially if they already have a Canon EOS R5, might be willing to jump into VR work if Canon&#39;s new system is as easy to use as it promises. The lens and EOS VR system are set to arrive in late December 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-introduces-its-new-vr-system-with-a-dual-fisheye-lens-040837782.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e38cab3-7d65-4227-8750-9ff89d80da2d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 04:08:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633513371</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T09:42:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former Sennheiser engineer Axel Grell made a $200 pair of ANC true wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Axel Grell, the designer of Sennheiser’s legendary HD580 and HD800 headphones, left the company to found Grell Audio.

He said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">Frances Haugen&#39;s</a> claims don&#39;t make sense and that they paint a &quot;false picture&quot; of the social network. &quot;At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritize profit over safety and well-being. That&#39;s just not true,&quot; he wrote in his post. The Facebook chief cited the Meaningful Social Interactions (MSI) update to News Feed, which was designed to show fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>He said the company went through with the change knowing that it would make people spend less time on the website, because research suggested it was the right thing thing to do for people&#39;s well-being. In Haugen&#39;s testimony, she painted MSI in a less flattering light. She said Zuckerberg chose to apply &quot;metrics defined by Facebook&quot; like MSI &quot;over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation and other inciting content.&quot; The whistleblower said the CEO was presented with solutions to make Facebook &quot;less viral, less twitchy,&quot; but he decided not to use them because they had a negative impact on the MSI metric.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the SEC complaint she filed, Haugen claimed that Facebook allowed &quot;hateful&quot; and &quot;divisive&quot; content, because it is &quot;easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.&quot; Zuckerberg addressed that in his post, as well, calling it &quot;deeply illogical.&quot; Facebook makes money from ads, he said, and advertisers apparently tell the company that they don&#39;t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Zuckerberg said the research into how Instagram affects young people was mischaracterized. He didn&#39;t explicitly mention it, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> published an article in mid-September about how it knows Instagram is toxic for teen girls based on internal documents detailing Facebook&#39;s own research. The social network eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">published</a> a couple of documents from that research, but Haugen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html">provided</a> Congress with four more. Zuckerberg defended the platform, writing that many teens the company heard from actually &quot;feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced.&quot;</p><p>Haugen, who joined Facebook in 2019, worked on democracy and misinformation issues when she was with the company. She brought &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of pages of internal Facebook documents to Whistleblower Aid founder John Tye in addition to filing a whistleblower complaint with the SEC. There were several reports that came out based on those documents, including the existence of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html">VIP program</a> that enabled high-profile users to skirt Facebook&#39;s rules. Haugen also accused Facebook of contributing to election misinformation and the January 6th US Capitol riots.</p><p>As for Zuckerberg, part of his post reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place? If we didn&#39;t care about fighting harmful content, then why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this than any other company in our space — even ones larger than us? If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we&#39;re doing? And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-denies-facebook-profit-over-safety-033717690.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed50340a-0baf-4f7c-a907-b0a4c4ef3cd8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 03:37:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633491486</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T03:38:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/01193280-fbe2-11e9-b3df-18f615b92db2" width="6219" height="4146" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/01193280-fbe2-11e9-b3df-18f615b92db2" width="6219" height="4146" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 25: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks about the new Facebook News feature at the Paley Center For Media on October 25, 2019 in New York City.

Or perhaps you <em>are</em> that streamer? Rode&#39;s boom arm has become a go-to for YouTubers, Twitch channels and podcasters alike. As handy as the PSA1 is, it isn&#39;t so good for lighter cameras and microphones —  at least not without some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM_Cl-hHZtQ">DIY adjustments</a>.</p><p>Enter the PSA1+ ($129). Unveiled today, it&#39;s a revised version of the ubiquitous mic arm that will handle devices as light as 94g / 3.3oz. That might not sound like much, but the original needed a lot more weight to keep its balance, effectively ruling out any microphone or camera under 700g / 24.7 oz. That excludes most webcams, all GoPros (which can now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-8-black-webcam-update-130050315.html">work as webcams</a>) and a bevy of other more affordable mics. Sure, you can tighten the screws or meddle with counterweights, but that isn&#39;t always ideal or guaranteed to work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Functionally, the PSA1+ feels a lot closer to something like <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass/">Blue&#39;s Compass</a> which holds itself in place even without weight thanks to a combination of hand-tightened friction hinges and its internal spring mechanism. Blue&#39;s offering might be better for lighter microphones and cameras but it doesn&#39;t adjust its position as accurately or smoothly as the PSA1 (although its cable management is better).</p><p>The extended device support on the PSA1+ isn&#39;t the only new feature. Rode claims the new arm is completely silent so you won&#39;t suffer errant squeaks or spring noises during your stream or recording. The company also states that part of this is thanks to a revised spring design along with the jazzy new neoprene cover (that kinda makes the PSA1+ look like it&#39;s headed to the gym). The cover makes for a more appealing design over the original&#39;s standard &quot;desk lamp&quot; aesthetic though. That said, there&#39;s some pretty strong branding printed on the side that&#39;ll likely catch your eye during videos. Sadly it doesn&#39;t seem like you can do much about that as the neoprene appears to be physically connected to the cable clips.</p><p>Those clips are a good thing though. As mentioned, cable management, which was functional but not pretty on the PSA1 (essentially it was velcro cable ties) now uses neater, sturdier plastic clasps which should be more reassuring. Now at least either your USB or XLR lead will mostly be out of sight.</p><p>The PSA1+ goes on sale tomorrow for $129.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rodes-psa-1-podcasting-boom-arm-230009046.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aae2d66d-dfd8-4766-9c60-a9f96550e114</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 23:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633429754</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T10:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2424b320-25c6-11ec-9f7d-db3c1e68053e" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2424b320-25c6-11ec-9f7d-db3c1e68053e" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rode]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rode PSA1+ Boom arm.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rode PSA1+ Boom arm]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony is making it harder to buy PS3 and Vita games]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-ps3-vita-store-reversal-psp-174551086.html">keeping the PS3 and Vita stores alive</a>, but that doesn&#39;t mean it will be easy to shop. <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-planning-to-make-ps3-vita-stores-nearly-unusable-1847801952">noticed</a> that Sony is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/">shutting down</a> credit card, debit card and PayPal store payments for its older consoles on October 27th.

According to Santosh Janardhan, the company&#39;s vice president of infrastructure, the outage started with what should have been routine maintenance. At some point yesterday, a command was issued that was supposed to assess the availability of the backbone network that connects all of Facebook’s disparate computing facilities. Instead, the order unintentionally took those connections down. Janardhan says a bug in the company’s internal audit system did not properly prevent the command from executing.</p><p>That issue caused a secondary problem that ultimately made yesterday’s outage into the international incident that it became. When Facebook’s DNS servers couldn’t connect to the company’s primary data centers, they stopped advertising the border gateway protocol (BGP) routing information that every device on the internet needs to connect to a server.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The end result was that our DNS servers became unreachable even though they were still operational,” said Janardhan. “This made it impossible for the rest of the internet to find our servers.”</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger-coming-back-online-after-outage-220412330.html">learned partway yesterday</a>, what made an already difficult situation worse was that the outage made it impossible for Facebook engineers to connect to the servers they needed to fix. Moreover, the loss of DNS functionality meant they couldn’t use many of the internal tools they depend on to investigate and resolve networking issues in normal circumstances. That meant the company had to physically send personnel to its data centers, a task that was complicated by the physical safeguards it had in place at those locations.</p><p>“They’re hard to get into, and once you’re inside, the hardware and routers are designed to be difficult to modify even when you have physical access to them,” according to Janardhan. Once it could restore its backbone network, Facebook was cautious not to turn everything back on all at once since the surging power and computing demands may have led to more crashes.</p><p>“Every failure like this is an opportunity to learn and get better, and there’s plenty for us to learn from this one,” said Janardhan.  “After every issue, small and large, we do an extensive review process to understand how we can make our systems more resilient. That process is already underway.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-outage-explainer-193155776.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ffcd19b-c3ab-4d9e-8a2d-0246b051ba72</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 19:31:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633462319</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T19:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/edc78c20-2611-11ec-bde6-5fb47d3ad17d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/edc78c20-2611-11ec-bde6-5fb47d3ad17d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook data center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Russian crew is shooting the first feature film on the ISS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Filming is underway on the first feature-length movie to be shot in space after Russian actor Yulia Sherepild and director Klim Shipenko docked at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iss">International Space Station</a>.

However, where Ubisoft&#39;s Bucharest studio hopes to differentiate the game is with a tweak to the battle royale formula. In <em>Frontline&#39;s</em> signature Expedition mode, you and your team will need to find three pieces of intel scattered across an island map. The twist is that you later need to extract that information by calling in an airlift. Other teams can ambush you during this crucial moment and steal the data you fought so hard to obtain. The playspace also won&#39;t get smaller as a match progresses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The franchise’s most recent outing, 2019’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-ghost-recon-breakpoint-jon-bernthal-ubisoft.html"><em><ins>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</ins></em></a>, was, to put it mildly, a disastrous release for Ubisoft. Thanks to its unfinished state, the game performed so poorly in its first week of availability that the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-ubisoft-watch-dogs-legion-delay-gods-and-monsters-rainbow-six-quarantine.html"><ins>delayed</ins></a> all of its biggest 2020 releases. It then went on to spend months patching <em>Breakpoint</em>, but the game never quite recovered from the reputation it earned at launch. Ubisoft said it plans to continue to support <em>Breakpoint </em>while working on <em>Frontline</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft didn&#39;t share a release date for <em>Ghost Recon Frontline, </em>but it said it would hold a closed PC test starting on October 14th that people in select countries across Europe can sign up to take part in by visiting the game&#39;s <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/ghost-recon/frontline#3K0BCfawqA7ByWsOZJCC48">website</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-frontline-battle-royale-180404978.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f417f5a-d54c-486d-9f22-bbbf7b41d6c2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 18:04:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633457048</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T18:04:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8db33ec0-2601-11ec-abfe-a3dc49a81388" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8db33ec0-2601-11ec-abfe-a3dc49a81388" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ghost Recon Frontline]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ghost Recon Frontline]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Razer Book laptop gets a price cut to $1,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Razer is joining many PC makers by <a href="https://press.razer.com/uncategorized/razer-is-ready-for-windows-11-with-new-razer-book-offers-free-upgrade-for-eligible-razer-laptops/">unveiling</a> new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> systems, although the biggest news may have more to do with prices than the computers themselves.
