To celebrate, we’ve made a 20-minute video conversation about the pros, cons and future of both consoles, hosted by PS5 enthusiast and Engadget Senior Editor Jessica Conditt, and Xbox Series X fan and Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar.</p><p>There may not be a clear-cut winner of this generation yet — in fact, the conversation tries to steer clear of most of the drama — so we’re focusing on what both PlayStation and Xbox have done right (and wrong).

The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled it cannot allow a US-style class action suit to be filed against the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The judgment focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws.</p><p>The battle began in 2017 with consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd, and many others, forming a group called Google You Owe Us, which attempted to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012.</p><p>While the group lost at the High Court, the UK’s Court of Appeal overturned this initial decision, saying it was fair for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sponsored by CISCO</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/smb-security-outcomes-study.html?ccid=cc001540&amp;oid=rptsc025200&amp;dtid=psolin000008">2021 Security Outcomes Study for Small Businesses</a></p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/smb-security-outcomes-study.html?ccid=cc001540&amp;oid=rptsc025200&amp;dtid=psolin000008"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26261d50-22e5-11ec-a9dd-8d658ab0308c" style="height:370;width:640;" alt="CISCO Image 1 " data-uuid="9244ec91-dd0b-35e0-87c6-2c4e90b113ae"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></a><p></p></div><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html https://www.engadget.com/...">iOS 15.2 beta introduces nearby AirTag searches</a></h2><h3>It may find unwanted trackers on your person.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/98cafc70-42e0-11ec-bbfd-cd793d174b81" style="height:438;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="809f3530-6a80-3b79-b5bb-78b8624b1e36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure></a><p>Apple is introducing another way to ensure its AirTags won&#39;t be used for stalking when iOS 15.2 comes out.

The software update comes with no change in hardware as HTC &quot;secretly built in the 6E required hardware from Day 1,&quot; tweeted HTC&#39;s global head of hardware products, Shen Ye.&nbsp;</p><div id="91d9e490f9974263a7cd093e10afdcf5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You also don&#39;t need new hardware. We secretly built in the 6E required hardware from day 1 😬. They&#39;re going through certification right now and we&#39;ll begin eabling as soon as they get approved.</p>— Shen Ye (@shen) <a href="https://twitter.com/shen/status/1458717100428574731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>WiFi 6E capability brings a &quot;wide range of benefits,&quot; according to Vive. That includes low latency and higher bandwidth for VR streaming with less WiFi interference. The wider frequency range also allows double the number of devices with their own dedicated channels. The headsets already had the hardware needed for the standard, &quot;so there&#39;s no added cost to the headset owner to leverage this functionality,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vive also introduced a feature called Location Based Entertainment (LBE) mode, designed for businesses that use the Focus 3 headset. It increases the size of the play area from a 15m x 15m space (225 square meters or 2,422 square feet) to 33m x 33m (1,089 square meters or 11,722 square feet). That&#39;s the size of four tennis courts, compared to a size just under a tennis court, the company noted.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af1a5040-42d4-11ec-af3f-4b2dfacdc80c" style="height:356;width:1159;" alt="Vive updates the Focus 3 headset with a much larger play area, WiFi 6e and more" data-uuid="53dde72d-f7b0-3978-a2a5-be4b986869d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>On top of the increased area, you can create a boundary in any custom shape like a polygon or L-shape. You&#39;ll only need to do that once, as the Focus 3 will &quot;constantly re-localize in the known play area.&quot; The new setting is designed to create large spaces for &quot;VR arcade, arena experiences or large training areas,&quot; according to HTC.&nbsp;</p><p>The update also includes Map Sharing, a feature that allows accurate co-location tracking among multiple users in a shared space. Other types of headsets that use outside-in tracking (rather than inside-out like the Focus 3), require &quot;users to carry a PCVR backpack and play in a limited space with the Lighthouse system,&quot; HTC notes. With the Focus 3, Map Sharing and LBE, &quot;users can finally run around in the field, provide cover for each other in shooting games or share their different perspectives in escape games,&quot; HTC said.</p><p>Other features include a Visual Odometery (VO) mode that lets you skip the usual 5-minute environment setup, an LBE Hybrid Mode that uses both VO and LBE for 6DoF tracking, and a Space Calibrator that allows accessories like a tennis racket to be more accurately tracked.

Now, the streaming giant has <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320">enabled</a> AV1 streaming on the PS4 Pro and a limited number of smart TV models. Netflix was a key contributor to the development of AV1, which is available for use royalty free under the Alliance of Open Media. It shared this list of supported TVs with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775150/netflix-av1-codec-tv-streaming-ps4-pro"><em>The Verge</em></a>:</p><ul><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 8K QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Frame 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Serif 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Terrace 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Any TV connected to a PS4 Pro streaming with the Netflix app</p></li><li><p>Select Amazon Fire TV devices with Fire OS 7 and above</p></li><li><p>Select Android TV devices with Android OS 10 and above</p></li></ul><p>The company explained that deployment on TVs took sometime because playback on TV platforms depend on hardware. It was only over the past year that the industry released models capable of AV1 streaming. Netflix conducted comparison testing before rollout and found that AV1 delivers videos with better quality than other codecs, especially when there&#39;s network congestion. It also noticed fewer noticeable drops in quality due to changing network conditions and lesser time to start streams. In addition, since AV1 has higher compression efficiency than the codecs Netflix is currently using, it needs lesser bandwidth. That could lead to longer streaming sessions in 4K resolution.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A team within the company created a rollout strategy to minimize associated costs with encoding its whole catalogue. Netflix will consider a title&#39;s popularity into consideration and start with well-known shows like <em>La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) </em>to make sure the AV1 streaming reaches the most number of viewers. The streaming giant also said that it&#39;s working with more manufacturers to develop more devices with AV1 playback capability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-av1-streaming-ps4-pro-select-tv-093538314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">587824c3-cc79-4279-b947-bebf4cfee986</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 09:35:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636620614</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T08:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Televisions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/87a4d8b0-e551-11e9-af83-d260a5f00ba0" width="4024" height="2665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/87a4d8b0-e551-11e9-af83-d260a5f00ba0" width="4024" height="2665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[amesy via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Southampton, England - July 31, 2017: Using a television remote control with dedicated Netflix button, TV in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TV Remote Control with Netflix Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony reportedly cuts PS5 production again as chip shortages and shipment issues bite]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 may not be able to beat the PS4&#39;s first year sales record due to an ongoing component shortage, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The company has reportedly cut its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html">previous production forecast</a> of 16 million down to 15 million, putting its target of 14.8 million PS5 sales by March in jeopardy, if the report is accurate. It also makes a bad situation worse in terms of consumers being able to pick up a PS5 over the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony is supposedly having trouble with not just parts supply but shipping logistics as well, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources. The problems are due in part to uneven vaccine rollouts in nations where Sony builds chips, and shortages of essential parts like power chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation has affected other console makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lowers-its-switch-sales-forecast-due-to-global-chip-shortage-083924964.html">Nintendo</a> and even affected the launch of an entirely new console, Valve&#39;s Steam Deck — pushing the date back until some time in 2022. It&#39;s got to the point that publishers are reportedly saying that sales are gradually shifting over to PC versions of games due to a lack of consoles.</p><p>March is still a long ways off, so Sony might still be able to pull off the sales record goal. But it&#39;s rather ominous that this report is arriving just ahead of Christmas, so if you&#39;re looking for a PS5 as a gift and see an opportunity to get one, better snap it up quick.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-may-be-cutting-play-station-5-production-even-more-than-it-forecast-085009885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16e39f5f-6d27-4c98-a2fc-5d0ea7798f2f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636620611</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T08:50:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has stopped cropping image previews on the web, too]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After doing so on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-full-size-image-previews-now-available-ios-android-201809678.html">mobile</a>, Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965">stopped</a> automatically cropping images on the web, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775241/twitter-web-full-sized-images-no-crop-algorithm?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#39;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#39;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#39;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook&#39;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c64f6866-99a2-4f16-9885-ceaa571429d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636581449</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:57:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/06: In this photo illustration a Disney+ (Disney Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone screen.

In a complaint filed with the US District Court for Northern California, the agency claims Uber violated Title III of the <a href="https://adata.org/learn-about-ada"><ins>Americans with Disabilities Act</ins></a> (ADA) by implementing a policy that has seen the company charge “wait time” fees to passengers who, as a result of their disabilities, need more time to enter a car. The law prohibits discrimination of individuals with disabilities by private companies.</p><p>According to the Justice Department, the policy has been in place since 2016 when Uber implemented it in a number of US cities before eventually expanding its use nationwide. Anytime a passenger needs more than two minutes to enter an UberX car or more than five minutes in the case of an Uber Black or SUV vehicle, the company charges that individual a wait time fee. Uber contends most users pay, on average, less than $0.60 when that’s the case. However, passengers with disabilities, including those with wheelchairs and walkers, often need more time to enter a vehicle than those without.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.</p><p>A spokesperson for Uber called the lawsuit “surprising” and “disappointing.” The full statement reads:</p><p><em>Wait time fees are charged to all riders to compensate drivers after two minutes of waiting, but were never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location but need more time to get into the car. We recognize that many riders with disabilities depend on Uber for their transportation needs, which is why we had been in active discussions with the DOJ about how to address any concerns or confusion before this surprising and disappointing lawsuit. </em></p><p><em>It has been our policy to refund wait time fees for disabled riders whenever they alerted us that they were charged. After a recent change last week, now any rider who certifies they are disabled will have fees automatically waived. We fundamentally disagree that our policies violate the ADA and will keep improving our products to support everyone’s ability to easily move around their communities.</em></p><p>The company also pointed to the fact it does not, by default, charge a wait time fee when someone requests a wheelchair accessible or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-03-uberassist-and-uberaccess.html"><ins>Uber Assist</ins></a> ride. This isn’t the first time Uber has been sued for allegedly violating Title III of the ADA. In 2017, disability advocates in New York City <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-18-uber-sued-again-failing-disabled-passengers.html"><ins>filed a class action complaint</ins></a> against the company. At the time, the group said Uber was inaccessible to 99.9 percent of people with mobility disabilities.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-uber-disability-lawsuit-214724043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">81b01eb8-bb9a-4124-808f-3564c74cf306</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:47:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636579232</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physical Disabilities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6031a890-9b9d-11eb-93bf-f9d0aa515883" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6031a890-9b9d-11eb-93bf-f9d0aa515883" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MOZCO Mateusz Szymanski via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Warsaw, Poland  - April 30, 2019: View on Uber car (Skoda) with inscription on the street before sunset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Uber car waiting for customer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch SpaceX launch its Crew-3 mission here at 9PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-crew-3-launch-date-delayed-191311158.html">a few delays</a>, SpaceX is finally (hopefully) ready to start its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-crew-3-launch-delay-175613942.html">Crew-3 mission</a>.

As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#39;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p><p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#39;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.&nbsp;</p><p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#39;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/congress-mandate-anti-drunk-driving-technology-cars-201820120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8936c47c-ccda-40c7-904f-02df1e7d2fe8</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636580871</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:47:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[3980290905 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve's Steam Deck won't ship until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712">delayed</a> the launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> by two months.

Both nations said they recognized a gap between current actions and the Paris agreement target of keeping that warming below 2C, and ideally no higher than 1.5C.</p><p>The exact terms weren&#39;t available as of this writing, but US climate envoy John Kerry said China committed to reducing methane emissions and coal use &quot;as fast as is achievable.&quot; China wouldn&#39;t, however, join a US-Europe initiative to cut methane emissions by a third no later than 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether or not this translates to meaningful action is far from clear. China has made some efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-baidu-teaming-with-geely-on-electric-vehicle-090704201.html">promote electric vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">reduce coal dependence</a>, but it&#39;s still the largest contributor to emissions and hasn&#39;t radically reduced its harmful output. It also hasn&#39;t had much of a presence at COP26, with President Xi Jinping declining to show up where US President Joe Biden was happy to attend.</p><p>The US isn&#39;t immune to problems, either. While the Biden administration has promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">halve greenhouse gas emissions</a> by 2030 and spur EV adoption, there&#39;s no guarantee it can pass legislation needed to honor its side of the pledge. That&#39;s also assuming the next White House doesn&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-20-trumps-plan-for-energy-independence-sacrifices-the-environment.html">undo previous environmental efforts</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s still rare to see the US and China agree on climate change issues, though, and the very existence of the pledge represents progress for China. The country hadn&#39;t previously acknowledged the impact of methane on global warming, for instance. That suggests China is at least aware of the scope of the problem, even if there&#39;s a long way to go before it addresses that problem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-china-climate-change-pledge-cop-26-194435337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc8c68e6-e1a3-40ab-99c1-46c2098b9d4b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:44:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636573495</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T19:44:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64699f40-3e67-11ec-b7dd-0cb40cc2537a" width="1440" height="961" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64699f40-3e67-11ec-b7dd-0cb40cc2537a" width="1440" height="961" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Phil Noble / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry speaks at a news conference during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 5, 2021.

Social network head Adam Mosseri has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803">revealed</a> that Instagram started testing its hinted-at &quot;Take a Break&quot; feature this week.

Like a previous time limit feature, Take a Break doesn&#39;t strictly enforce the pauses. You can simply tap &quot;done&quot; and continue scrolling.

Not that Instagram or its parent Meta have much choice. The company is under pressure from regulators and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, both of which have accused Meta of focusing too much on hooking users and not enough on caring for them.

ViacomCBS gets a chance to promote its content, and Twitter gains access to additional revenue.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-viacomcbs-streaming-agreement-announcement-171623256.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2811d23-aba4-4bd1-b90b-d1a7552e5816</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 17:16:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636564230</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T17:10:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/529fc640-0f38-11eb-9f7e-504b114aa4b3" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/529fc640-0f38-11eb-9f7e-504b114aa4b3" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2020/08/28: In this photo illustration an icon of Twitter app displayed on a smartphone.

Sometimes, they&#39;ll work for any customer with a large-enough bank account. <em>The Record</em><a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-mercenary-group-void-balaur-has-been-hacking-companies-for-years/">reports</a> that Trend Micro has <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-far-reaching-attacks-of-the-void-balaur-cybermercenary-group">identified</a> Void Balaur, a &quot;cybermercenary&quot; group that has struck both political and commercial targets since 2015. It primarily steals data to sell to whoever&#39;s willing to pay, whether that&#39;s a government or a fraudster.</p><p>Void Balaur was initially linked to attacks against human rights activists and journalists in Uzbekistan. More recently, it attacked Belarusian presidential candidates in 2020 and several political leaders in an unnamed Eastern European country. However, the hacking outfit also targeted executives and directors at a very large Russian company between 2020 and 2021, and has been attacking and selling data from telecoms, banks and cryptocurrency users. The group has been linked to the on-demand hacking site RocketHack.me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear just where Void Balaur operates from, or whether it has official government support. There&#39;s some overlap between Void&#39;s targets and those of the Russia-backed APT28 (aka <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fancy-bear-reportedly-hacked-us-agency-213304085.html">Fancy Bear</a> or Pawn Storm), but not enough to establish a clear link. And while the group has only ever advertised its services on Russian-language sites, it&#39;s not necessarily operating from Russia. We&#39;d add that Russia usually turns a blind eye to cybercriminals only so long as they don&#39;t attack Russian interests — Void doesn&#39;t have problems attacking Russian businesses.</p><p>The study illustrates the difficulty in pinpointing the nature of some hackers, let alone catching them. Cybermercenaries also pose a particularly severe threat as they&#39;re often happy to attack any target without reservations. It won&#39;t be surprising if there are more groups like Void Balaur that have simply gone undetected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/void-balaur-cyber-mercenary-hacking-group-163522871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f73ca4-4b39-4867-87b3-7f715e65e114</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 16:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636562126</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T16:35:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Witthaya Prasongsin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of hands typing on laptop.

But there are tools out there that can help someone stretch beyond their comfort zone, or simply document and fine-tune their own ideas. From subscriptions, to books, to extremely bizarre instruments, here are the best gifts for the creative in your life.</p><h2><em>You Are an Artist </em>by <strong>Sarah Urist Green</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c46440-2dd2-11ec-ba9d-5a9250b7b827" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="1f7fd47c-32f1-3721-8688-e65bff503ba4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget / Penguin Books</div></figure><p>It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes just being told what to do is a great way to spur creativity. Because, truth is, rarely is the actually creative part in the original idea, but rather in the execution of it. The problem is, once someone leaves school nobody is giving them assignments any more. That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:You Are an Artist" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD"><em>You Are an Artist</em></a> comes in, a book compiled by Sarah Urist Green, the host of PBS’ <em>The Art Assignment</em> on YouTube. It’s a collection of 50 assignments crafted by a diverse set of artists to help get the creative on your list, well, creating.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the assignments focus on visual arts, asking them to make endless copies of an image using a Xerox machine, or to take random photos of a location and make notes on details they might normally miss. But there are others that encourage them to hum or clap along with the sounds of traffic, or engage in word games. <em>You Are an Artist</em> is the sort of book they’ll probably revisit time and time again. <em>— Terrence O&#39;Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD" id="ebdc0efcf41a4b96a31447574ff763d4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy You Are an Artist at Amazon - $13</a><h2>Apple Pencil (second-gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/1557e020-c608-11ea-9e7e-db158d5192d4" alt="Apple Pencil 2nd generation" data-uuid="b370310d-93cd-4148-96e6-15a2ed508a46"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPad has become a key tool for creatives over the years and arguably nothing has contributed to that more than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Pencil" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16">Apple Pencil</a>. Most of the newest iPads support the second-generation Pencil and it’s admittedly much more convenient than the first purely for its magnetic charging method. But otherwise, the Apple Pencil is the best stylus I’ve ever used because it has little to no latency and that helps mimic the feeling of drawing with a traditional pen and paper.</p><p>While investing in a paper-like screen protector will blur the lines even further, you don’t have to do that to get an excellent experience from the Apple Pencil. Drawing is seamless, taking notes is a breeze (especially with iPadOS 15 if you use Apple’s Notes app) and the possibilities are endless once you get familiar with third-party programs like Procreate. Battery life is superb, too: I’ve spent hours drawing in Procreate or experimenting with different planner layouts in GoodNotes and I have yet to pause a session to recharge the Pencil. While the Apple Pencil hasn’t completely replaced traditional art forms for me, it’s certainly the most useful tool I own for when I want to be creative. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16" id="af4bccea0e4243e7a02e607070d024c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple Pencil (2nd gen) at Amazon - $129</a><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite smart typewriter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c0bac0-2dd2-11ec-b6dc-a6b13463d287" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="64d9f49b-d71e-3c80-9bf6-6011ef8b6cd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dan Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://fave.co/3lxet7w">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> is a niche device that would nonetheless make a wonderful present for any aspiring writer. Or, come to think of it, anyone who is already committed to the art of putting words to the page. The Freewrite combines an excellent mechanical keyboard with an E Ink display, and while it can get online to sync drafts to the web, that&#39;s the only thing it can do. There&#39;s no way to browse the web, play a game, or watch YouTube on the Freewrite, which makes it a lot easier to just sit down and get into a flow state.

Spawned in the UK in the late ‘70s (though only Mute remains today), both companies informed generations through tales of — sometimes careless — business tactics and quality curated output. In general, they were groups driven by a DIY aesthetic and creativity unhindered by official structure.</p><p>Not only did these labels champion freedom of musical expression and help drive new genres of music, but they also became an outlet for visual designers. Most notably, Peter Saville’s (<a href="https://www.typeroom.eu/peter-saville-on-joy-division-unknown-pleasures-stellar-cover-art">found</a>) cover art for Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures album (Factory) is ubiquitous today with its mountainous range of wavy lines.

The crux of it is demanding three pages of handwritten writing every day. While it’s often a stream of consciousness — and if your handwriting is atrocious, barely legible — Cameron’s advice is to simply put the writing out there, and see where it takes you. Famous fans include <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and practically half of the comedians whose podcasts I listen to, it seems. The book does get a little bit spiritual at times, which you may or may not be fine with, but the core exercises and ideas can be pretty powerful, especially if you’re in a creative rut, or simply looking to add more artistic output to your day-to-day life. <em>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YKjwc8" id="e7c321ea740a4676873d9d320830fec9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy The Artist&#39;s Way at Amazon - $25</a><h2>Moog Subharmonicon</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c1f340-2dd2-11ec-ae77-5f2d8cdfd31a" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="028ed964-5764-3564-85c8-7d0bb2a5089a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>Another slightly weird instrument to consider is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Moog Subharmonicon" href="https://amzn.to/3FErV1x">Moog Subharmonicon</a>.

So, rather than just using the same Rhodes sample that thousands of other bedroom producers have relied on, a person can hit the shuffle button and grab something that might be flying under the radar. This technique can also be combined with searching for random terms on Splice, rather than pulling up specific instruments. (Just Google “random word generator” and use that as the basis for a search.) There are lots of interesting and sometimes strange sounds and loops to be found by searching for things like “clinic” and “preparation.”</p><p>The entry-level $10 Sounds+ plan includes 100 sample credits.

One of our favorites is the Nest Hello (now called the Nest Doorbell Wired), which is why we were pleased when Nest came out with a new battery-operated version, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Nest Doorbell Battery" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnjvkO">Nest Doorbell Battery</a>. It’s a great gift for both homeowners and renters, as you don’t need to hardwire it. Battery life is anywhere from one to six months depending on how active it is (it’s shorter if you live on a busy street, for example). The Doorbell notifies them whenever there’s a person, animal or vehicle near the front door. It can also let them know when a package has been placed, which is great for pre-empting theft. In addition, it offers three hours of event video history for free, with the option to purchase more space through a Nest Aware subscription.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnjvkO" id="b485f059051746e195fea7a0cf3d32e5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Doorbell Battery at Best Buy - $180</a><h2>Google Nest Hub (2nd gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/68cf0f30-422b-11ec-be6e-34dc44ff22f2" alt="Nest Hub (2nd gen) for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

The two are designed to work together: anytime someone rings the doorbell, the camera view of who’s at the front door will show up on the Nest Hub’s screen. Even without the doorbell, however, the smart display is a great device to have around the home — especially if your loved one already uses the Google Assistant. It works as a digital photo frame and they can use it to watch YouTube and Netflix. It can also make calls via Google Duo and offers recipe videos along with step-by-step cooking instructions.
