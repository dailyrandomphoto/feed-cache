This and a later wave of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-17-waymo-jaguar-i-pace-ev-self-driving-tests.html">Jaguar I-Pace EVs</a> will rely on human drivers to map streets and learn from the environment, but the goal is clearly to achieve full autonomy.</p><p>The test will focus on Manhattan below Central Park (aka midtown and lower Manhattan), including the financial district and a portion of New Jersey through the Lincoln Tunnel. All tests will operate during daylight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The dry run will help Waymo&#39;s Driver AI cope with New York City&#39;s notoriously heavy traffic, of course, but the company is particularly interested in weather testing. Like many northern cities, NYC has its fair share of ice and snow, both of which remain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-08-waymo-snow-navigation.html">huge challenges for driverless cars</a>. This test will give Waymo further opportunities to test its navigation in winter conditions, not to mention the heavy rainfall more common in the region.</p><p>Waymo said it was &quot;encouraged&quot; by the responses from politicians, regulators, industry and non-profits. With that said, it&#39;s easy to see the potential for a backlash. NYC has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">highly protective of its taxi business</a> at times, and is heavily dependent on ridesharing. While fully driverless ride hailing services like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-phoenix-public-193945960.html">Waymo One</a> may not arrive for a long time in the city, taxi and rideshare operators alike likely won&#39;t be thrilled at the prospect of being replaced by autonomous systems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f025f4b-12e3-4d4a-b32c-fd4fdc9aed08</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 13:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635887073</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T21:04:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a2fefa0-3c1b-11ec-bfeb-09e0beaa0f08" width="5287" height="2974" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a2fefa0-3c1b-11ec-bfeb-09e0beaa0f08" width="5287" height="2974" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[March 2, 2020 Mountain View / CA / USA - Waymo self driving car performing tests on a street near Google's offices, Silicon Valley; Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is developing an autonomous car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Waymo self driving car performing tests on a street near Google's offices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ZipCharge Go is a suitcase-size powerbank for EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ZipCharge has launched a new type of charging product for EVs that might be able to convince people worried about range anxiety to switch from gas vehicles. The British startup has introduced a powerbank for EVs called <a href="https://www.zipcharge.global/">ZipCharge Go</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html">Cop26</a> climate summit. It&#39;s about the size of a suitcase and weighs around 50 pounds — plus, it has wheels and a retractable handle, so users can put it in their trunk and easily take it out when they need to charge.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, the Go can provide up 20 miles of range after being plugged into the car for 30 minutes. A higher capacity version will be able to provide an EV up to 40 miles of range. The device works with any plug-in hybrid or EV with a Type 2 socket, and it can charge that vehicle to its full capacity between 30 minutes to an hour. Charging up the device itself is as easy as plugging it into any socket, and users will be able to control and monitor it through an app, where they can schedule future charges during off-peak hours for cheaper costs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While range anxiety is becoming <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/500640/survey-price-hurdle-ev-adoption/">less of an issue</a> these days, it&#39;s still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/range-anxiety-very-real-jd-power-evs-survey/">keeping</a> those on the fence from making the leap. A company called Gogoro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html">developed</a> hot-swappable battery technology for scooters to address the problem, but batteries in electric cars typically can&#39;t be swapped out. SparkCharge has a portable EV charging system called the <a href="https://www.sparkcharge.io/roadie">Roadie</a>, but it&#39;s not nearly as easy to carry around as the Go.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the ZipCharge Go isn&#39;t available yet. According to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545066/zipcharge-go-portable-ev-charger/"><em>InsideEVs</em></a>, the startup plans to release a 4 kWh and an 8 kWh version, as well as to start deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022. It can be leased for at least £49 (US$67) per month, though it will also be available for purchase to EV owners who don&#39;t mind paying for one and to businesses like hotels that don&#39;t have installed charging facilities. While ZipCharge has yet to reveal a price for it, <a href="https://www.driving.co.uk/news/business/zipcharge-portable-ev-charger-unveiled-cop26/"><em>The Sunday Times Driving</em></a> section says the company aims to sell it for around the same cost as a 7.2kW home charging port installation.</p><div id="b66870179d784637bc1595a917da2a28"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GNrA8PvQwI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zip-charge-go-electric-vehicles-122503445.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8efbc283-d181-4483-a051-bc91dc28abb8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 12:25:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635940793</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T11:59:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/563f1090-3c95-11ec-af6d-a7dd6d4b37fc" width="1440" height="926" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/563f1090-3c95-11ec-af6d-a7dd6d4b37fc" width="1440" height="926" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zipcharge]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zipcharge Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zipcharge Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon one-day sale drops the price of Philips Hue kits and bulbs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Philips Hue lighting products can do some pretty cool things these days, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/philips-hue-lights-spotify-integration-094738525.html">syncing with Spotify</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-14-philips-hue-white-ambiance.html">helping you sleep</a>.

Prices range from $150 to $180 for the smaller packages, while the larger whole brisket box is $250.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/traeger-provisions-review-120027663.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html">Elon Musk says Hertz hasn&#39;t actually ordered 100,000 Tesla EVs yet</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-charities-to-donate-to-130021399.html">Seven tech charities to support this holiday season</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/home-entertainment-gift-ideas-143038506.html">The home theater gear worth gifting this year (even if the giftee is you)</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-braking-recall-software-glitch-132442476.html">Tesla issues recall of 11,704 EVs over braking software glitch</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-512-gb-returns-to-a-record-low-of-750-at-amazon-133540260.html">Apple&#39;s 512GB Mac Mini M1 returns to a record low of $750 at Amazon</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-mobile-stranger-things-android-ios-171232076.html">Netflix starts rolling out mobile games to all Android subscribers</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shut-down-january-31-2022-181008602.html">&#39;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&#39; is shutting down on January 31st, 2022</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-productivity-keyboard-mouse-silent-mechanical-switches-pro-type-ultra-pro-click-mini-164230459.html">Razer&#39;s latest Productivity keyboard and mouse have &#39;silent&#39; mechanical switches</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-plant-based-mc-donalds-burgers-are-here-113040739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4fa3f7d8-9f30-466e-979c-a4ec1a49d0e7</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 11:28:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635938905</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T11:28:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/804de120-2e7d-11ec-bff5-ffaa0a3e667f" width="1440" height="810" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/804de120-2e7d-11ec-bff5-ffaa0a3e667f" width="1440" height="810" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Stadia adds free trials for 'Control' and 'Riders Republic']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in October, Google Stadia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-introduces-free-trials-with-its-own-hello-engineer-game-092557521.html">introduced</a> free trials with its <em>Hello Engineer</em> game. While the service lets users try any game they want with a $10-per-month Pro subscription, it was the first time free users were given the chance to test a game before purchase. Now, according to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/02/google-stadia-adds-more-free-trials-control-for-30-minutes-riders-republic-for-2-hours/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, Stadia is giving free users the opportunity to take two more games for a spin before they have to buy them. One of those games is <em>Control: Ultimate Edition</em>, which recently just came out for the platform.</p><p><em>Ultimate Edition</em> contains the core <em>Control</em> game, along with the expansions that were released for it. Like <em>Hello Engineer</em>, players will be able to test it out for 30 minutes before they have to decide whether to pay $40 for a copy. The other game is Ubisoft&#39;s recently released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-riders-republic-release-date-195412051.html"><em>Riders Republic</em></a>, a massively multiplayer extreme sports game, where teams can battle each other on bikes, skis, snowboards and in flying wingsuits. Players will get the chance to try it out for two hours instead of just 30 minutes, perhaps because half an hour might barely be enough to cover tutorials when there are several extreme sports to choose from. Besides, <em>Riders Republic</em> isn&#39;t cheap and costs $60 to purchase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the addition of these two games, we can probably expect Google to make more titles available for free trial in the future. It could be an effective way to get people who&#39;d rather own the titles they play interested in purchasing from Stadia instead of from other gaming platforms.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-free-trials-control-riders-republic-102537840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80facd8b-7d43-4426-895c-6e25ec416689</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 10:25:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635934766</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T10:19:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47f78210-3c86-11ec-bfff-741576379f38" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47f78210-3c86-11ec-bfff-741576379f38" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple sold a record number of MacBooks last quarter, says Strategy Analytics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple got some of its MacBook sales mojo back last quarter thanks to discounts on the MacBook Air, according to the research firm <a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-Notebook-PC-Demand-Remained-Healthy-in-Q3-2021-Growing-8-Year-on-Year/default.aspx"><em>Strategy Analytics</em></a><em>. </em>The company sold a record 6.5 million MacBooks in Q3 2021, up 10 percent over last year — no doubt contributing to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-q3-2021-earnings-financial-results-205158698.html">blockbuster Mac quarter</a>.

Chromebook sales tumbled by 29.8 percent year-over-year to 6.5 million units, thanks largely to &quot;saturation&quot; in the education market. &quot;Many schools and governments blew out their budgets to provide devices for remote learning and even consumers aggressively purchased devices for learning in 2020,&quot; the firm wrote. Lenovo again topped the sales list for Chromebooks, followed by Acer, Dell, HP and Samsung.</p><p>Tablet sales slowed 9.4 percent to 42.3 million units, due to reduced demand and limited supply. The exception to that trend was Apple, which saw iPad sales grow 4.6 percent over last year to 14.7 million units.

The 10-episode limited series was directed by Hiro Murai (<em>Atlanta</em>), while Patrick Somerville (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-made-for-love-surveillance-chip-tech-dystopia-202900680.html"><em>Made for Love</em></a>) served as writer and showrunner.

That’s according to a new <a href="https://f4d9b9d3-3d32-4f3a-afa6-49f8bf05279a.usrfiles.com/ugd/f4d9b9_16ccca9c25a04445a69dcd0298fd530d.pdf">report</a> from the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a> (CCDH). The organization found that ten publishers are responsible for 69 percent of all interactions with climate change denial content on Facebook. Included in the group, which the CCDH titled “The Toxic Ten,” are <em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Russia Today</em> and <em>Media Research Center</em>, which has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/how-fossil-fuel-industry-got-media-think-climate-change-was-debatable/">ties to the fossil fuel industry</a>.</p><p>The findings broadly mirror that of another report the CCDH published earlier in the year, which found that as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html">73 percent of vaccine misinformation</a> on Facebook can be linked to only 12 individuals dubbed the “disinformation dozen.” That study has been widely cited by US lawmakers who have called on social media platforms to do more to address the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">urgent threat</a>” misinformation represents to public health.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it did with the earlier disinformation dozen report, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Meta</a>, Facebook’s parent company, disputed the methodology the CCDH used to compile its latest study. “The 700,000 interactions this report says were on climate denial represent 0.3 percent of the over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period,” a spokesperson for the company said. It also pointed to the recently announced expansion of features like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html">Climate Change Information Center</a> as evidence of its commitment to tackling misinformation on the topic.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/02/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-breitbart/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said the organization looked at approximately 7,000 articles published between October 2020 and October 2021. He called the sample “robust” and said there was enough data “to derive representative finds of trends.”</p><p>Additionally, the report examined the financial incentives involved in publishing climate change denial content. The CCDH estimates eight of the companies included in the Toxic Ten made $5.3 million in Google ad revenue over the last six months, with $1.7 million going to the search giant. &quot;We recently <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321?hl=en">announced a new policy</a> that explicitly prohibits publishers and YouTube Creators from monetizing content that promotes climate change denial. This policy will go into effect on <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9336650?hl=en">November 8</a> and our enforcement will be as targeted as removing ads from individual pages with violating content,&quot; a spokesperson for Google told Engadget.</p><p>“When you put it all together, you’ve got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species,” Ahmed told <em>The Post</em>.</p><p>The timing of The Toxic Ten report comes as delegates from around the world meet at the UN’s COP26 climate summit in Scotland in what’s been described as “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-government-and-politics-china-climate-environment-and-nature-01317e4c6f5630f29024753209b48aef">the world’s last best chance</a>” to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Without dramatic reductions, the planet is currently on track for a “catastrophic” 2.7 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. With every additional degree of warming beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html">1.5-degree target</a> put forward by the Paris Agreement, there’s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even more dramatic changes to the climate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/climate-change-denial-report-ccdh-205333083.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da9a489c-6a25-4dd1-9ba9-c4951bcaf89b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 20:53:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635886763</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T20:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ea2d9b80-3c15-11ec-b9f7-4763ab09fc55" width="3907" height="2605" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ea2d9b80-3c15-11ec-b9f7-4763ab09fc55" width="3907" height="2605" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden puts on headphones to listen to speeches during "Action on Forests and Land-Use" event at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 2, 2021.

The company is <a href="https://blog.roku.com/developer/2021/10/26/idk">dropping</a> support for &quot;non-certified&quot; private channels on that day in favor of beta channels that are limited to 20 users.

Rather, this may be more about control. Roku doesn&#39;t have to worry about channel operators bypassing its official system, particularly those that might get the company in trouble. Whatever the reasoning, this may prompt porn fans to switch to Android TV, Fire TV or browser-equipped platforms that still offer ways to watch racy material.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-porn-ban-201136254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">705c0e7e-5539-4ac8-841e-7f6920cac34f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 20:11:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635883901</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T20:11:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/094af260-3c11-11ec-aaf3-0cf9eb086737" width="5184" height="3364" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/094af260-3c11-11ec-aaf3-0cf9eb086737" width="5184" height="3364" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Front left view of a Roku box on a white background]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Front left view of a Roku box on a white background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo's Flex 5 Chromebook is on sale for $300 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re going to use a Chromebook as your daily driver — or even just more than once or twice a day — you should get a decently powerful one.

Amazon now has this versatile Chrome OS laptop at the best price we&#39;ve seen — only $300. That&#39;s $130 off its normal price and an all-time low.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wcZ2W2" id="f335e64448da4c46a7c67e6c52bee178" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $300</a><p>The model on sale runs on a 10th-generation Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. While the latter two are pretty common in entry- to mid-level Chromebooks, the Core i3 processor will help this laptop feel zippier than others. While we initially weren&#39;t thrilled by the 4GB of RAM, we found that the Flex 5 Chromebook was more than capable of running multiple tabs simultaneously. As for storage, 64GB should be enough for most people who do most of their work in the Chrome browser anyway. Even at its normal price, the Flex 5 Chromebook provides a lot of power compared to other similarly priced devices — but at $300, it&#39;s a fantastic value.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most Chrome OS machines in this price range tend to sacrifice on style, and while Lenovo&#39;s laptop isn&#39;t ugly by any means, it&#39;s not the slickest either. It weights about three pounds and measures 0.66-inches thick, but it does have a handy convertible design so you could use it as a tablet or even in tent mode to watch TV shows and movies. It has a decent 1080p touchscreen, too, along with a decent array of ports that includes two USB-C ports and a USB-A port. Lenovo did a good job of combining most key features of a good Chromebook into this laptop, which is why we continue to recommend it both when it&#39;s on sale or at regular price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-is-on-sale-for-300-right-now-183046713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8185a6c0-1029-47d2-8d7f-a117aa6157a9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 18:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635876489</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T18:08:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Harry Potter: Wizards Unite' is shutting down on January 31st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Niantic is ending support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-harry-potter-wizards-unite-launch-hands-on.html"><em><ins>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</ins></em></a>.

After coming to nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bethesda-10th-anniversary-edition-skyrim-084030796.html"><ins>every system imaginable</ins></a>, Bethesda’s seminal 2011 RPG is about to get the tabletop treatment. Modiphius Entertainment, the company behind <a href="https://www.modiphius.com/fallout.html"><em><ins>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</ins></em></a>, is working on <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/Battle-Dragons-Draugr-Trolls-and-More-as-You-Fight-to-Save-Skyrim-in-t"><em>The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim - The Adventure Game</em></a><em>. </em>Set to come out sometime next summer, the game will allow you to revisit Tamriel’s frozen north as an agent of the Imperial Blades. You can play either by yourself or with up to three other friends.</p><p>The narrative-driven game will ship with two campaigns made up of three chapters. Modiphius says each one should take about 90 to 120 minutes to complete. Provided you don’t get distracted by side quests and exploration (not an easy feat in any Elder Scrolls game), you can expect your initial playthrough to take about 12 hours. Worry not, you can “save” your progress at any point, and pick up where you left off. The decisions you make during a playthrough will shape how the story unfolds. And with a deck of about 600 cards driving the narrative, no two sessions should play out exactly the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you want to read more about the game, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22757411/skyrim-board-game-campaign-price-release-date"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has a detailed preview.

The first 2,011 people to back the project’s base tier can get the game by itself for £68 (approximately $92).

The company has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/">announced</a> it&#39;s shutting down the Face Recognition system on Facebook in the &quot;coming weeks.&quot; You&#39;ll no longer be automatically recognized in photos if you opted in to the feature, and the Facebook team will delete over a billion facial recognition templates. Automatic Alt Text&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-explains-ai-alt-text-for-photo-descriptions-154018448.html">descriptions for the visually impaired</a> will also stop naming people detected in photos.</p><p>The company said it made the decision following &quot;growing concerns&quot; about the broader use of facial recognition, including &quot;uncertainty&quot; about regulation of the technology. While Meta believed face recognition could still be helpful in some situations, such as gaining access to a locked account, it felt a &quot;narrower,&quot; more privacy-oriented approach was a better fit than the broader outgoing strategy. On-device recognition wouldn&#39;t require sharing data with outside servers, for example.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There was already significant pressure to shut down the system. Meta (then Facebook) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-facial-recognition-lawsuit-650-million-191451396.html">settled a privacy lawsuit</a> over facial recognition for $650 million in 2020, and it likely isn&#39;t eager to grapple with similar cases. Governments ranging from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/massachusetts-statewide-police-ban-facial-recognition-bill-064534909.html">Massachusetts</a> to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-parliament-facial-recognition-ban-ai-bias-165833826.html">European Union</a> have either passed or are strongly considering at least partial bans on facial recognition use. Facebook&#39;s opt-in system may not have explicitly run afoul of those laws, but the message is clear: wide-ranging facial recognition systems aren&#39;t very welcome.</p><p>As it stands, Meta isn&#39;t alone. Amazon now has an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rekognition-police-ban-222425615.html">indefinite ban</a> on police use of its Rekognition platform, and Google has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-google-hold-off-selling-facial-recognition-technology.html">declined to sell</a> facial recognition tech since 2018. Although Meta hasn&#39;t completely given up on the concept, it&#39;s clearly eager to be seen as forward-thinking — and continue mending its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tim-cook-privacy-cpdp-2021-slams-facebook-184333398.html">less-than-stellar reputation</a> for privacy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-shuts-down-face-recognition-171737198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">774cc24b-d5b3-42c9-bcfa-b4727bc4e71d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 17:17:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635941400</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T12:10:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/9be91600-ba1e-11e9-9c9e-5422a36fc275" width="3500" height="2275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/9be91600-ba1e-11e9-9c9e-5422a36fc275" width="3500" height="2275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture illustration shows a Facebook logo reflected in a person's eye, in Zenica, March 13, 2015.

They tend to be more expensive than some competing options, but if you’re patient, you can usually find them on sale. To that point, Amazon has discounted the <a href="https://amzn.to/3w6X8pR">black 1TB Touch model</a> from $190 to $150, matching the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-t7-portable-ssd-500gb-sale-amazon-133505208.html">previous all-time low price</a> for the SSD.  You can also get the silver colorway for less than MSRP, but it’s only discounted by $20. Additionally, the 2TB variant is $70 off, making it $300 currently. If you want to save an extra $10, the non-Touch model, which doesn’t include a built-in fingerprint sensor, is <a href="https://amzn.to/3EzQ08r">$140 at the moment</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3w6X8pR" id="8931f0984a344dcab7f4c9986eb31aa7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 Touch (1TB)">Buy Samsung T7 Touch (1TB) at Amazon - $150 </a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EzQ08r" id="6124459b94fe4ec8a089c8565df7b0b5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 1TB">Buy Samsung T7 (1TB) at Amazon - $140</a><p>Whether you go for the standard or Touch model, the T7 has a lot going for it. Both variants feature an aluminum outer casing that will protect the solid-state drive from drops. They also include ePCM technology and a Dynamic Thermal Guard feature to assist with heat management. When it comes to performance, the T7 can read files at up to 1,050 MB/s and write them at up to 1,000 MB/s. And while it only features a single USB-C port, the T7 comes with both USB-C and USB-A cables inside the box, allowing you to use it with almost any modern device, including some video game consoles. For those reasons, we think the T7 is a solid option for storing your photos and other important files.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-t7-touch-ssd-amazon-deal-155643217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a6788ae-df22-405a-8b1f-78fabacd509e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:56:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635868608</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T15:56:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/42d0bab0-3bf3-11ec-bbf7-a1146cd20671" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/42d0bab0-3bf3-11ec-bbf7-a1146cd20671" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung T7 Touch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's budget WH-CH710N ANC headphones drop back down to $78]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-early-black-friday-tech-deals-so-far-november-1-2021-amazon-best-buy-123511788.html">early Black Friday deals</a> are popping up, and if you&#39;re looking to snag an entry-level set of active noise cancellation (ANC) headphones, you can&#39;t go too far wrong with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html">Sony&#39;s WH-CH710N</a>.

Microsoft gave us a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-holograms-hololens-ar-vr-164001796.html">glimpse of its vision earlier this year with Mesh</a>, a platform for virtual meetings that can take place across HoloLens 2, mixed reality headsets, computers and smartphones. It&#39;ll be a while before we&#39;re stepping into meetings as holographic projections, though, so Microsoft is announcing something a bit more grounded: Mesh for Teams.</p><p>The pitch, as you&#39;d expect, combines the virtual environments and personas that Mesh delivers with Teams&#39; established workplace collaboration. Instead of hopping on a Teams meeting with your webcam, for example, you could pop up as a customized avatar that talks and animates along with your voice. Eventually, Microsoft plans to animate your avatar by following your face and movements with your webcam, something that should get even better as you step up to devices with more microphones, cameras and sensors like the HoloLens 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5511bff0-3bec-11ec-9dee-87727154e1c4" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Mesh for Teams large" data-uuid="4ab6e868-ec68-3d94-9bc3-f0cad94e1789"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>It&#39;s all about delivering that elusive sense of &quot;presence,&quot; the feeling that you&#39;re right beside your colleagues virtually. And while it may seem silly at first, Mesh for Teams could be a huge step forward for people who don&#39;t always feel comfortable on webcams. After all, there are plenty of times, like when you&#39;re working early in pajamas, or covered in your kids&#39; lunch mess, where you may be working but not exactly camera ready.</p><p>In addition to avatars, Mesh for Teams will also include pre-built immersive spaces to hang out virtually. That could let groups create a customized meeting space, much like an actual office. There&#39;s also the potential for those spaces to replicate hanging out in an office kitchen or water cooler. That seems a bit more fanciful, but it makes sense to experiment with virtual spaces. Having a virtual coffee chat with your avatar could end up being less stressful than flipping on your camera. Microsoft says companies will eventually be able to design spaces themselves, allowing them to reflect their actual offices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/551198e0-3bec-11ec-bb5f-8d453ce88f2b" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Mesh for Teams large" data-uuid="bc0bf28a-6be8-3220-af22-2916913a4f11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Mesh for Teams will start rolling out in 2022. Microsoft isn&#39;t giving up on its more expansive Mesh vision though: companies can still use that platform to create complex 3D environments, which workers can access through a variety of devices.</p><p>Alex Kipman, the Microsoft technical fellow who spearheaded the Kinect and HoloLens, originally pitched Mesh as a way for first-line workers to remotely collaborate on complex 3D models. Mesh for Teams boils that idea down for the typical knowledge worker, the sort of person who spends most of their day at a desk hopping between meetings, emails and office apps. It may not seem as exciting as Meta&#39;s pitch for a metaverse filled with multiplayer games and virtual events, but for many people, it&#39;s a far more useful way of thinking of a more connected internet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-for-teams-multiverse-work-150047792.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1c6efde-a70f-4b25-b597-f3bf7a29f592</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635865339</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T15:02:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55114ac0-3bec-11ec-a7ef-943a5eef1284" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55114ac0-3bec-11ec-a7ef-943a5eef1284" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mesh for Teams large]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mesh for Teams large]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop is a new Office app built for collaborative work]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft Loop, a new Office collaboration app announced today, takes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-06-microsoft-fluid-framework-collaboration.html">company&#39;s Fluid Framework vision</a> one step further. You might remember that technology from Microsoft&#39;s recent developer events: It&#39;s  a way to collaborate on specific chunks of content, say a table or chart, synchronized across multiple Office apps. A table you create in Outlook, for example, would instantly update if someone plugs it into a Word document and adds new information. Up until now, we&#39;ve only seen that<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fluid-framework-office-online-outlook-160022166.html"> implemented in Office online as a sort of test</a>. Microsoft Loop is a far bigger bet on the future of document collaboration.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c874e0-3be2-11ec-9dff-fdeae9ef59b7" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Microsoft Loop" data-uuid="9cbbe3df-1193-3d48-9b36-65fce1e0ff32"><figcaption>Multiple people collaborating on a Fluid Framework poll.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Like Fluid Framework, one of the core parts of the new app are Loop Components, which Microsoft calls &quot;atomic units of productivity.&quot; They can include anything from as a list to a complex Dynamics 365 project, all of which will stay in sync when they&#39;re deployed in Office apps. You can organize your Components in Loop Pages, a new type of document that can also include files and links. Think of them like unstructured Word documents (or perhaps more like how people typically use Google Docs).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, there are Loop Workspaces, a way to view components and pages related to specific projects. According to Microsoft,  &quot;Workspaces make it easy for you to catch up on what everyone is working on, react to others’ ideas, or track progress toward shared goals.&quot;</p><p>If you&#39;re getting serious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-19-google-wave-opens-doors-to-public-asks-old-friends-for-new-chan.html">Google Wave</a> vibes from all of this, you&#39;re not alone. But Microsoft Loop sounds a bit more focused than that failed attempt at team collaboration. For one, the core idea of Fluid Framework makes sense. Now that we&#39;re all working across multiple documents online, it makes sense to have a way to synchronize elements within those files. Wave felt like a solution in search of a problem, whereas Microsoft Loop, despite its seeming complexity, addresses a growing problem many office workers face today.</p><p>Microsoft says it&#39;ll share more about Loop in the upcoming months. Until then, though, you can expect to see Loop components coming to Teams, Outlook, OneNote and other Microsoft 365 apps later this month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-loop-office-365-fluid-framework-150029033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4e9e7a5f-4e59-4450-b299-d167f37dab8e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635860923</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:48:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa84f90-3be2-11ec-af9a-39c4f9c9c66a" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa84f90-3be2-11ec-af9a-39c4f9c9c66a" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Loop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Video editing and audio recording are coming to Microsoft Office apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://news.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> is boosting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-2021-october-5-2021-170152304.html">Office</a> with some (arguably overdue) media creation tools. As part of a sweeping set of updates, the company is adding Clipchamp video editing to the Office suite. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-acquires-clipchamp-040823250.html">recently acquired</a> web-based tool helps you make &quot;professional-looking&quot; clips regardless of your skills. You can produce videos for your other Office projects, of course, but Microsoft also sees Clipchamp as a straightforward editing tool for personal footage.</p><p>It will also be much easier to add that professional sheen to your PowerPoint presentations. Microsoft is adding a &quot;recording studio&quot; to PowerPoint that lets you capture audio for those moments when you can&#39;t (or just don&#39;t want to) present live. You can annotate slides, customize the background and pick the view that will best help you record. When you&#39;re done, you can preview the presentation and re-record as much as necessary. Be patient for this feature, though, as Microsoft only expects it to become &quot;generally available&quot; in early 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other updates are subtler, but could be just as helpful in the right circumstances. Microsoft is trotting out Context IQ, a set of AI &quot;experiences&quot; for Microsoft 365 that will initially make situationally-aware recommendations in Editor. It will suggest relevant contacts when you want to tag people, for instance, or recommend meeting times when everyone is available.</p><p>Developers will also have a better reason to try Excel. Microsoft is introducing a JavaScript framework in the spreadsheet app that lets you create custom data types and functions using the web-based language. JavaScript will be available later in November in preview form. Many (if not most) Excel users won&#39;t have much need for this, but it could be valuable if your job revolves around data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-clipchamp-video-editing-150014886.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e52538aa-21d7-43cc-bc29-d8b09b509ccd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635863044</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aec386a0-3be2-11ec-b76f-d6b96a9a5498" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aec386a0-3be2-11ec-b76f-d6b96a9a5498" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Windows on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Word on a Surface Laptop in a collaborative work environment]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Word on a Surface Laptop in a collaborative work environment]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
