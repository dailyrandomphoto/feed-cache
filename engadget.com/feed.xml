On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>published a comprehensive report on Kotick&#39;s handling of the sexual harassment lawsuit California&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>Department of Fair </ins></a>Employment<a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins> and Housing</ins></a> (DFEH) filed against the publisher in July. In short, the outlet claims Kotick not only knew about many of the worst instances of abuse at the company, but in some cases, he may have also acted to protect employees accused of harassment.</p><p>&quot;We have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy,&quot; Activision Blizzard employee advocacy group A Better ABK <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329?s=20"><ins>said</ins></a> on Twitter after the report came out. &quot;We will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO and continue to hold our original demand for Third-Party review by an employee-chosen source.&quot; The group plans to stage a walkout today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="50b5836aa54a462b90f30c201fea9a5d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy.

According to documents obtained by the outlet, Kotick penned the now-infamous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-executives-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit-response-192228768.html"><ins>email</ins></a> Frances Townsend, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Activision Blizzard, sent to employees after DFEH filed its lawsuit. In that message, the company said the complaint presented &quot;a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago.&quot; The response drew the ire of many Blizzard employees, who said it was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html"><ins>abhorrent and insulting</ins></a>.&quot;</p><p>The report also provides insight into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html"><ins>recent departure of Jennifer Oneal</ins></a>. One month after her <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html"><ins>appointment</ins></a>, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader reportedly sent an email to the company&#39;s legal team in which she said she wasn&#39;t convinced Activision Blizzard would turn its culture around. Referencing a moment earlier in her career at the company, she says in the email, &quot;I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere, the report describes an episode involving Dan Bunting, one of the heads of Activision&#39;s Treyarch studio. In 2017, Bunting was reportedly accused of sexually harassing a female employee. Following an internal investigation, Activision&#39;s HR department recommended he be fired, but Kotick reportedly intervened to keep him at the company.</p><p>A spokesperson for Activision Blizzard disputed <em>The </em>Journal&#39;s reporting. The company&#39;s full statement reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>We are disappointed in the Wall Street Journal’s report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO. Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry’s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their — and our — values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick’s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.</p></blockquote><p>The company also commented on the impending walkout. &quot;We are fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment for all of our employees around the world. We support their right to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,&quot; a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard told Engadget.</p><p>Amid the unrest at Activision Blizzard, Kotick has presented himself as an ally of the studio&#39;s employees. &quot;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone-deaf,&quot; he said in an<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html"><ins> email</ins></a> he sent after the Townsend message. In that same message, he claimed he would take &quot;swift action&quot; to create a safe and inclusive working environment. When Kotick later announced the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html"><ins>zero-tolerance harassment policy</ins></a>, he said he would take a massive pay cut until Activision Blizzard&#39;s board of directors felt he had met the diversity and safety goals he outlined.</p><p>Even after today&#39;s report, it&#39;s hard to see Kotick resigning. He has been with Activision since the early 1990s, and he was the architect of the 2008 merger that created Activision Blizzard. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116006294/en/Activision-Blizzard-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Recent-Article">board of directors</a> has also said it &quot;remains confident&quot; in his leadership.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47dfec06-3247-47fa-9264-724fccf51e4d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637092494</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T19:55:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bobby Kotick, chief executive officer of Activision Blizzard, attends the annual Allen and Co.

Starting today, users over the age of 18 with more than 10,000 followers can apply to use the feature. The company introduced Badges in <a href="https://about.instagram.com/en-us/blog/announcements/supporting-creators-on-instagram">May of last year</a>. Then, in October, it expanded their availability to approximately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-expands-badges-and-commercials-130020878.html">50,000 creators</a>. Badges represent a way for Instagram creators to earn money from their fans. Users can purchase them to make themselves during livestreams. Instagram sells them in increments of $1, $2 and $5.</p><p>The company recently said it wouldn’t collect any fees on Badges until at least 2023. Down the line, the feature could help Instagram diversify its revenue beyond the advertising sales it depends on almost exclusively at the moment. More broadly, Badges could be the prelude to more perk-like monetization features making their way to the app in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-badges-us-rollout-180045149.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed93d3b0-537c-4bb6-a589-76326ec0d7aa</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636998265</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T17:44:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The latest version of NVIDIA's DLSS technology is better at rendering moving objects]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA has released a major update for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-virtual-reality-games-no-mans-sky-154453795.html"><ins>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)</ins></a> technology. With <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-image-scaler-dlss-rtx-november-2021-updates/"><ins>version 2.3</ins></a> of the software, the company says the AI algorithm makes smarter use of motion vectors to improve how objects look when they’re moving. The update also helps to reduce ghosting, make particle effects look clearer and improve temporal stability. The latter has traditionally been one of the weakest aspects of the technology, so DLSS 2.3 represents a major improvement. As of today, 16 games feature support for DLSS 2.3. Highlights include <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Doom Eternal</em>.</p><div id="9d71c95fcc874bffa8d75c07932f1b26"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBjL0M25t04?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>If you don’t own an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3080-review-ray-tracing-130054340.html"><ins>RTX GPU</ins></a> but still want to take advantage of the performance boost you can get from upscaling a game, NVIDIA has updated its Image Scaling technology to improve both fidelity and performance. Accessible through the NVIDIA Control Panel, the tool uses spatial upscaling to do the job. That means the result isn’t as clean as the temporal method DLSS uses, but the advantage is you don’t need special hardware. To that end, NVIDIA is releasing an SDK that will allow any GPU, regardless of make, to take advantage of the technology. In that way, NVIDIA says game developers can offer the best of both worlds: DLSS for the best possible image quality and NVIDIA Image Scaling for cross-platform support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-2-3-update-180000345.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5b7b5099-107f-4891-942a-b4bc42863c41</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637085603</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T18:00:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2cea9630-4706-11ec-a95d-eb584318071c" width="3697" height="1850" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2cea9630-4706-11ec-a95d-eb584318071c" width="3697" height="1850" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['League of Legends' spin-off 'Ruined King' suddenly arrives on consoles and PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/riot%20forge/"><ins>Riot Forge</ins></a> said it would soon provide more long-awaited details about <em>League of Legends</em> spin-off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ruined-king-league-legends-130055934.html"><em><ins>Ruined King</ins></em></a><em>,</em> few fans would have expected Riot Games&#39; publishing arm to suddenly thrust the game into the world.

DTS supports 5.1-channel audio, but not a 7.1-channel setup or overhead speakers.

Sonos claims that, when the speakers are completely off, Move can retain battery life for up to 30 days and Roam can do so for as long as 70 days.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Now Playing screen on the iOS app will have EQ settings.

We&#39;ve been fans of these palm-sized drives for a while thanks to their compact designs and fast speeds, but they do come at a premium price. But now you can get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB Samsung T7 drive" href="https://amzn.to/3Ck7XpV">1TB Samsung T7 drive</a> for $130, which is $40 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen.

Both have compact, shock-resistant bodies that are small enough to fit into nearly any bag or backpack, and they&#39;re strong enough to withstand drops from up to six feet. The T7 also uses ePCM technology and Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels, so even when you&#39;re pushing it to its limits, it should not overheat. As far as performance goes, the T7 supports reads speeds up to 1,050 MB/s and write speeds up to 1,000 MB/s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And just because the T7 doesn&#39;t have a fingerprint reader doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t protect your files from prying eyes. It has optional password protection, so only those who know the password can even check out the files saved on the device. And since it comes with both USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables, you can use it with most devices you&#39;ll have around your home, including tablets and some game consoles.</p><p>Samsung&#39;s T7 only goes up to 2TB, but you&#39;re in luck if you want even more storage in a similar package. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:SanDisk&#39;s Extreme portable SSD" href="https://amzn.to/3oAYFkp">SanDisk&#39;s Extreme portable SSD</a> in 4TB is on sale right now, too, for $500 — that&#39;s $200 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen.

The web-based Streamlabs Studio will let streamers customize their broadcasts with widgets and overlays, such as a chat panel or live stream alerts.</p><p>&quot;Live streaming gives viewers unprecedented access to their favorite creators. Real-time viewer engagement via chat and alerts create incredible shared experiences,&quot; Ashray Urs, Streamlabs&#39; head of product, said in a statement. &quot;In the past, creating professional broadcasts and engaging viewers from a console has been challenging. With Streamlabs Studio, you can transform console gameplay into a high-quality live stream production with viewer engagement tools to interact with your community.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Typically, Twitch streamers who broadcast their console gameplay have had to run the video through a PC with the help of a capture card if they want to add bells and whistles like onscreen donation alerts or custom layouts. Xbox owners can now select &quot;Streamlabs&quot; as a destination in the Twitch app and log into the <a href="https://streamlabsstudio.com/">Streamlabs Studio website</a> to customize their stream. The site works on mobile and tablets, so you don&#39;t even need a PC to personalize your stream or switch between preset scenes.</p><p>What&#39;s more, you can use your smartphone or tablet as a webcam and layer that into your stream. Streamlabs Studio can also capture audio from a headset plugged into a controller or video from a webcam that&#39;s connected to an Xbox and include those feeds in broadcasts.</p><p>Streamlabs Studio isn&#39;t free — it costs $5/month or $50/year. However, it could help Twitch streamers who don&#39;t have a capture card or capable PC to make their broadcasts stand out from the pack.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-previews-easier-twitch-streaming-on-xbox-one-consoles-073445970.html"><ins>testing an option</ins></a> that makes Twitch streaming easier on Xbox consoles.

The headline feature is a carousel that shows local news in response to search queries, launching around the world in all languages starting today. Google initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-21-google-coronavirus-search-hub.html">launched</a> the feature to provide local information for COVID searches, but it&#39;s now been expanded to other topics like sports, local government and more.</p><p>Google said it&#39;s been tweaking its systems so that authoritative, relevant local news sources appear more often next to national publications in Top Stories and other general news features. &quot;This improvement ensures people will see authoritative local stories when they’re searching for news, helping both the brand and the content of news publishers reach more people,&quot; Google said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also able to drill down into narrow subtopics related to local news, like high school football. Combined with its location services (provided you have those enabled), you should get more relevant results. &quot;For example, if you’re in Detroit and search for football, we’ll now show you results for local high school and college teams, rather than just showing you results for, say, the professional team,&quot; Google said. It will also surface tweets from news organization along with &quot;authoritative sources and authors.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ad6e3f0-46d6-11ec-b7b0-b4f76d9be602" alt="Google launches new features to support local news organizations" data-uuid="14b195a2-c8e6-30f8-af3c-158ee9f837b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Alongside the new consumer features, Google announced new data tools for reporters. First up is the Census Mapper project, a map that can be embedded in stories to display Census data at the national, state and county level.

A <a href="https://png.sainsburys.co.uk/">website</a> for the upcoming SmartShop Pick &amp; Go store only mentioned the technology coming from a &quot;third-party supplier,&quot; but <em>Bloomberg</em> sources said Amazon was responsible.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment. A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson wouldn&#39;t confirm or deny Amazon&#39;s involvement, but did say it was testing an &quot;upgraded version&quot; of SmartShop with employees in a Holborn store. The shop is believed to be opening to the public on November 29th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hardware certainly appears to be Amazon&#39;s, if <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s visit to the store was any indication. Customers scan their phones on the way in, and ceiling-mounted cameras use AI to detect what they take from shelves. You&#39;re charged as soon as you leave the store.</p><p>Sainsbury&#39;s has a few incentives to adopt Just Walk Out. While the UK has relaxed many of its pandemic measures, this could be appealing to customers who still want to avoid contact with staff and often-touched self-checkout kiosks. The faster turnarounds could lead to more customers even without safety concerns. And then there&#39;s competition — Tesco recently opened a nearby Express store using rival technology from Trigo Vision. Sainsbury&#39;s risks losing business from time-conscious shoppers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">828e2255-d2c7-4a5a-8c04-c831c733cc56</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:10:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637075018</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T15:03:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/74a6c1e0-46ea-11ec-9c9f-e1c84dc77e48" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/74a6c1e0-46ea-11ec-9c9f-e1c84dc77e48" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2020/11/05: A man wearing a face mask walks past the Sainsburys shop in Holborn, London as Sainsbury's announce they are to cut 3,500 jobs and close 420 Argos stores.

Food Scan is the latest addition to the app’s “scan” functionality, which also allows users to identify plants and dog breeds and items of clothing.</p><p>Now, scanning a food will turn up recipes containing the item, as well as a link to the Wikipedia entry for the ingredient. Snap has partnered with allrecipes.com on the feature, which it says can recognize more than 1,200 items and suggest more than 4,500 dishes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I got the chance to preview the feature, and the app’s food scanning abilities were mostly spot-on. It was able to correctly identify a variety of produce and recommend relevant recipes (including a persimmon bar recipe that looked intriguing). Like most of these types of visual search features, though, it’s not entirely foolproof. It suggested cherry recipes when I scanned a bag of cherry tomatoes. And a hunk of ginger managed to totally stump the feature. No matter what angle I held the camera, Snapchat was unable to recognize it as food, and instead recommended reptile and human hand-themed AR lenses.</p><p>The feature is also not meant to work with packaged foods — Snapchat has a separate feature that can scan those items for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-food-and-wine-labels-130019011.html"><ins>nutritional info</ins></a> — so it won’t be able to help you figure out what to do with that random can of tomato sauce or whatever else is collecting dust in the back of your pantry. But even with those limitations, the feature is still a useful starting point for when you’re out of ideas or just want to try something new. And, even when it doesn’t quite work, you might still find an entertaining new AR lens to try out.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchats-camera-can-scan-food-to-recommend-recipes-150040166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17f49f18-3fde-4824-bdd2-2814cb830970</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637028049</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T02:00:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat's camera can scan food for recipe inspo.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snapchat food scan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlayStation Remote Play now supports PS5 DualSense controllers on Android 12]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.remoteplay&amp;hl"><ins>PS Remote Play app</ins></a> on Android, which now has some extra controller features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2012/"><ins>Android 12</ins></a> users.

Thankfully, there&#39;s a somewhat more accessible option. The instrument brand has <a href="https://www.fender.com/acoustasonic/player/en">unveiled</a> an Acoustic Player Telecaster with both a more affordable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,200 price" href="https://fave.co/3osZV9k">$1,200 price</a> and a simpler design with a three-way voice selector (versus five on other models) and one blend knob.

If you&#39;re willing to pay a bit more for the extra storage, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3cdWXzU">512GB model</a> remains on sale for $750 thanks to another automatically applied coupon that knocks an additional $30 the sale price.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FkZBjH" id="a7915f9583e744bc8df4153d0c1e0789" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $600</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3cdWXzU" id="2da669df04994ca28836f39c6550a20f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $750</a><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/30owQDE">MacBook Air M1</a> starting at $999, the Mac Mini M1 is the most budget-friendly way to upgrade to a machine with one of Apple&#39;s latest chips. You can expect the Mac Mini to perform similarly to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air</a> — speedily and smoothly. We were impressed by the M1 chipset&#39;s performance — it made the MacBook Air feel lightning fast and native apps performed better than we&#39;ve ever seen them. The Mac Mini M1 has eight-core CPU, an eight-core GPU and a 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks. You&#39;ll also get 8GB of RAM in this machine along with 256GB of storage. If you plan on storing a lot of photos, documents and other things on the desktop, you may want to spring for the 512GB model — or simply invest in a solid portable SSD that you can connect to the Mac Mini.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the rumor was that we would see an updated Mac Mini this year, that didn&#39;t end up happening. That means the machine looks much the same as it has for the past few years. It&#39;s a small silver box housing a variety of ports including two Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A connectors, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Thanks to its size, good array of ports and upgraded power with the M1 chip, the Mac Mini is a solid option for those who want a compact machine that doesn&#39;t compromise performance.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Its 4.9-inch screen has a 1080p resolution, and it comes with a 48-megapixel rear camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, as well as a fingerprint sensor. The Balmuda Phone is powered by a Snapdragon 765 processor, and it has 6GB of RAM, 128GB of internal storage and a 2,500 mAH battery capacity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, the company only has plans to release the phone in Japan. Those curious enough to give the device a shot can get it with a plan with Softbank, though they could also purchase an unlocked version if that&#39;s the better option. Pre-orders in the country will begin on November 17th at 10AM Japan time, and shipping will start on November 26th. Balmuda didn&#39;t say whether the device will eventually be available elsewhere, but the company did release the iconic &quot;The Toaster&quot; in the US last year for those who don&#39;t mind paying $329 to get perfectly toasted bread every time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/japanese-toaster-maker-balmuda-first-smartphone-112521675.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d1bc3fd-3124-43ac-b6f9-be5f3a299da7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:25:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637059771</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T10:49:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73eeb1c0-46c4-11ec-bdfd-c3cd47e42f09" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73eeb1c0-46c4-11ec-bdfd-c3cd47e42f09" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Balmuda]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps grocery pickup feature expands to 2,000 US stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is bringing a bunch of updates to Maps this holiday season today, making the app more useful for getting around while you&#39;re gift- or grocery shopping. Most of the new features were either already announced or available in limited regions, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-indoor-live-view-eco-friendly-routes-pickup-and-delivery-integration-100020907.html">grocery shopping integration in select Fred Meyers stores in Oregon</a>. Now, after that pilot test, Pickup with Google Maps is available in over 2,000 stores in the US from the Kroger Family organization, including Kroger, Fry&#39;s, Ralphs and Marianos.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that when you shop at a participating outlet via its website, you&#39;ll be able to track your order status in Maps, share your ETA with the store and let them know when you&#39;ve arrived. According to Google, people who use pickup with Maps &quot;typically wait less than five minutes for their groceries.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also adding <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/maps101-popular-times-and-live-busyness-information/">Area Busyness</a> to Maps, which is similar to the existing graph you&#39;ll see in Google Search results for restaurants, businesses and popular attractions. It&#39;s also reminiscent of the feature that launched earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html">let Maps users see how crowded specific trains or buses</a> are in real time. With Area Busyness, you can check out how many people are in a specific neighborhood, as well as the individual &quot;restaurants, shops and recreational places (like a museum) within it,&quot; Google said. It&#39;ll be available globally on Android and iOS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ab7dd5d0-4688-11ec-8ffb-0408a281f137" style="height:972;width:2000;" alt="A composite of four phone screenshots showing the four steps on how the new Pickup with Google Maps works. " data-uuid="038598a3-c578-33de-b0e1-23f4721e249f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In the US, Google wants to help budget-conscious diners hone in on restaurant search results by offering price ranges based on contributions from other Maps users. You&#39;ll see how much a meal at each establishment typically costs, like $10 to $20 for example, and the number of people that estimate is based on. You can also tap into the details to see how many people submitted a price range, just like you&#39;d see the number of reviewers who rated a product one, two, three, four or five stars on most shopping sites.</p><p>You can add your own feedback about how much you paid at each place, and Google is also making it easier to add info like whether there&#39;s outdoor seating, curbside pickup and delivery options in your reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the company is bringing the Directory tab to Android and iOS for all airports, malls and transit stations around the world. In the past, this was <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-maps-adds-mall-directory-search-browse-local-panel-292366">selectively available</a> under the more information section of specific malls or businesses. Now, &quot;when we have this data available,&quot; Google said, you&#39;ll be able to get detailed information about the types of stores in a building, like parking lots, airline lounges, toy stores or clothing outlets, and see a list of shops in each category. It&#39;ll also show opening hours, store ratings and the floor they&#39;re on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-area-busyness-directory-grocery-pickup-updates-110055937.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28427e62-4c40-4ba6-89c9-d320711f334d</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 11:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637031850</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T03:04:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b766a60-4684-11ec-9bbf-3d27374f47c0" width="2096" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b766a60-4684-11ec-9bbf-3d27374f47c0" width="2096" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A graphic showing the Google Maps logo surrounded by drawings of buildings, snowflakes, holiday lights, cars and silhouettes of trees, a frozen pond and a skater on it.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Maps holiday updates 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
