That’s a 10 percent discount off its usual $1,999 starting price. We’ve seen price reductions on the new MacBook a handful of times since launch — most notably when Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-are-already-discounted-at-amazon-143028122.html"><ins>discounted both the 14- and 16-inch variants</ins></a> by $50 the week they came out. However, $200 off is an all-time low for a computer that only went on sale at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-event-2021-highlights-194601228.html"><ins>end of October</ins></a></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/n1Wjyo" id="5262e7c91c4c46f78a16e049421980c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at Adorama - $1,799</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3p6KZOp" id="f45f579bf0e54ed8b995f48ce27ae6e3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at B&amp;H - $1,799</a><p>We&#39;ll note here only the Space Gray model is part of today&#39;s promotion. If you want the computer in Silver, it’s $1,999. You also can’t upgrade any of the components without paying the full price of the computer. Thankfully, the base model is plenty powerful with its 8-core M1 Pro processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the new MacBook Pros a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html"><ins>score of 92</ins></a>. Apple addressed a lot of the issues that made the previous generation so divisive. To start, unlike its predecessor, the 14-inch model comes with almost all the ports you could want. It features three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI connection, a MagSafe power port, a headphone jack and an SD card slot. Another standout feature of the 2021 MacBook Pro is its Liquid Retina XDR display. The one on the 14-inch model features a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964 and is capable of reaching 1,600 nits of brightness. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes using the computer feel smoother. The only downside of the display is that unsightly notch. But if you don’t mind it, there’s a lot to like about the 2021 MacBook Pro.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-macbook-pro-cyber-monday-deal-165803308.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">787c3ec4-d15e-4f2a-85d5-c2f23231afbd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 16:58:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638205087</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T16:58:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller drops to $50 for Cyber Monday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the Switch&#39;s Joy-Cons are perfectly suitable for casual gaming, those who want a bit more control and comfort should consider springing for the Switch Pro Controller or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html">something similar to it</a>.

His first stint as Twitter CEO, which he co-founded, ended in 2008 when he was pushed out, but he was still on the board. He returned as CEO in 2015 when Dick Costolo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-11-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-out.html">departed</a>.</p><p>Last year, activist investment firm Elliott Management called for Dorsey to leave his position at Twitter. The firm&#39;s founder, Paul Singer, suggested Dorsey&#39;s dual CEO role meant he wasn&#39;t able to focus enough on the social media platform. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html">reached a deal</a> with Elliott Management, which included a $2 billion stock buyback, to keep Dorsey in place, despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-twitter-covid-19-olympics-jack-dorsey.html">a shaky outlook for the company</a> when the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to take hold.</p><p>Twitter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/twitter-earnings-q3-2021-1235037125/">missed</a> Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share last quarter. The main engagement metric, monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rose by 13 percent year-over-year to 211 million. However, average US mDAUs remained at 37 million for the second quarter running. In September, the company agreed to pay $809.5 million to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-settlement-class-action-suit-151202542.html">settle a class-action suit</a>, in which investors accused the company of providing misleading numbers about engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertising is still by far the biggest driver of Twitter revenue ($1.14 billion of the $1.28 billion it generated last quarter), but the company has been exploring other ways of making money over the last couple of years. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-revue-newsletter-service-124341255.html">bought newsletter service Revue</a> in January and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-revue-newsletter-subscribe-button-tweets-163814091.html">integrated it</a> into the core Twitter platform.

We&#39;ve seen numerous models go on sale before and during Black Friday, and now a new Cyber Monday sale has knocked iRobot devices down to new record lows. Key among them are the new poop-detecting j7 duo of robot vacuums, both of which are $200 off. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba j7" href="https://amzn.to/3FZmhWW">Roomba j7</a> has dropped to $449 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:j7+" href="https://amzn.to/3lcZDTh">j7+</a>, which comes with a clean base, is down to $649. Those prices are being matched at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Xx2obo">Best Buy</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Wellbots" href="https://fave.co/313HGzO">Wellbots</a>, too.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FZmhWW" id="f0b98bfacc0641cca7a8b8d4c13acdd8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7 at Amazon - $449</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3lcZDTh" id="6e4c40ed2de44e5db43ba9744e24d898" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $649</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rgwQ43" id="8dd8052ae65b442f89ab5282bc3312c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Roomba Cyber Monday sale at Amazon</a><p>&quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">Poop-detecting</a>&quot; might sound gimmicky, but these robot vacuums have new AI-driven computer vision technology that helps them detect obstacles as they clean so they can move around them. That means, instead of bumping into chair legs and tables, these machines will do a better job of cleaning around those permanent fixtures in your home — and they&#39;ll more easily avoid surprise hazards like pet poop. And if your new robo-vac doesn&#39;t avoid your pet&#39;s latest mess, iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if such a disaster happens within your first year of ownership.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Otherwise, the j7 devices are higher-end Roombas, so they have features like dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, which lets you control which rooms the robot cleans. The biggest difference between the j7 and the j7+ is the inclusion of the clean base on the latter. When it returns home to charge, the j7+ will automatically empty its bin into the clean base and you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months.</p><p>A number of more affordable Roombas are included in the sale, too, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3xyA18c">Roomba 694</a>, which remains on sale for $179. This is one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">our favorite budget robot vacuums</a> thanks to its good cleaning abilities and easy to use mobile app. You can also get the top-of-the-line Roomba, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:s9+" href="https://amzn.to/3xzq6zk">s9+</a>, with the Braava Jet mopping robot for over $450 off, bringing it down to $1,299.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The Galaxy Watch 4 is our favorite smartwatch for Android users, and Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cyber Monday sale" href="https://amzn.to/3d5qCvj">Cyber Monday sale</a> bundles the wearable with a speedy wireless charger while also knocking the price down to a record low. You can get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Galaxy Watch 4 with the charger" href="https://amzn.to/3xCOTCK">Galaxy Watch 4 with the charger</a> for as low as $200, which is $110 off its normal price and the lowest we&#39;ve seen it. The price will vary a bit depending on the specific size and model you choose, but overall, this one-day-only sale presents a good opportunity to pick up a new smartwatch and a key accessory for less.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xCOTCK" id="91ef1d4c092d4f32b70547d3f303198b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Watch 4 bundle at Amazon - $200</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3d5qCvj" id="adeb09f11c2d46cc9ea0fefad4f26f26" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Samsung Cyber Monday deals at Amazon</a><p>We gave the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">score of 85</a> when we reviewed them thanks in part to their attractive designs, bright screens and comprehensive health tracking. These devices are the first to run Wear OS with the new One UI, and thankfully those who liked Samsung&#39;s Tizen operating system will find that not much has changed here. But since it now has more Google support, you&#39;ll be able to do things like download apps directly from the Play Store and the watch has better third-party app support in general. And for those who want a wearable primarily for health tracking, you&#39;re getting the best Samsung has to offer here with a new 3-in-1 biometric sensor that enables bioelectrical impedance analysis, all-day heart rate monitoring, features like snore detection and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest difference between the Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic is the rotating bezel on the latter and its stainless steel frame, making it a better option for those who want a more classic-timepiece look in their wearable. The bundled wireless charger can not only power up the watch, but it can also charge a smartphone or a pair of wireless earbuds at the same time thanks to its second, larger charging pad.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch discounts are part of a larger <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cyber Monday Samsung sale" href="https://amzn.to/3d5qCvj">Cyber Monday Samsung sale</a> on Amazon, which includes deals on wireless earbuds, too.

Five Roblox creators were nominated, with the in-app clothing store <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/62008951/cSapphire-Clothing-Store">cSapphire</a> coming out the winner.&nbsp;</p><p>The presentation of the award will play out inside a Roblox experience (from November 29th until December 7th 2021), with a virtual representation of Gucci creative director Alessandro Michele (above) doing the honors. If you&#39;re interested in watching, you&#39;ll be able to do so inside a virtual <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/7711545622/The-Fashion-Awards-2021">Roblox recreation</a> of Albert Hall — and even roleplay as a high-profile red carpet guest.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Companies like Roblox have been doing a metaverse long before Facebook decided to jump in. With the award, the BFC has acknowledged that virtual spaces can be a fun way for both consumers and designers to explore fashion ideas. Roblox previously worked with Gucci on a collection, and we&#39;ve seen labels like <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/11/fortnite-moncler-collaboration-outfits-accessories-loading-screen">Moncler</a> Louis Vuitton inside <em>Fortnite</em> and other games.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a fun addition to the show, but the BFC is taking it fairly seriously. The Metaverse judging panel includes some high-profile folks, including fashion model Karlie Kloss along with editors from fashion sites and magazines like <em>W</em> and <em>Highsnobiety</em>.</p><p>&quot;By awarding the platform’s creators, we are recognizing the powerful global impact of digital fashion on communities around the world, its ability to create new trends in fashion, as well as the incredible opportunities it provides for talented young creators,&quot; said BFC chief executive Caroline Rush in a statement.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-british-fashion-council-is-giving-an-award-for-the-best-roblox-design-132423514.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca45f909-537d-4716-b959-1c85e5e43b54</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 13:24:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638192266</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T13:24:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Fashion]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6587ff10-5114-11ec-bf75-cb8e06b4fb20" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6587ff10-5114-11ec-bf75-cb8e06b4fb20" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BFC/Roblox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The British Fashion Council gave an award for the best Roblox design]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The British Fashion Council gave an award for the best Roblox design]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's impressive WF-1000XM4 earbuds fall to a new all-time low of $218]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:WF-1000XM4 wireless ANC earphones" href="https://amzn.to/2ZDVPD2">WF-1000XM4 wireless ANC earphones</a> came out just this summer, so we&#39;ve only seen mild discounts so far — even during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-earbuds-speakers-audio-gear-deals-black-friday-2021-121511068.html">Black Friday</a>.

They deliver balanced sound quality across lows, mids and highs, with no heavy-handed bass or overly shrill treble. Active noise cancellation (ANC) is also improved, blocking more noise across all frequencies while using less power, to boot.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a result, battery life is up to eight hours with the ANC turned on, or 12 hours with it disabled — up about 25 percent over the previous model. Other nice features include Qi-certified wireless charging (with a quick-charge feature that gives you an hour of use in five minutes), customizable sound controls, Sony&#39;s &quot;precise voice pickup&quot; tech to improve call quality, and 360 and high-res audio support.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest downside is the comfort and fit, as Sony&#39;s foam (rather than silicone) tips might not work for all ears. That&#39;s a small complaint considering that the WF-1000XM4s top a lot of lists for the best wireless ANC earphones, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">including our own</a>.

It aims to release 15 new EVs total by 2030, with electrified vehicles making up half its vehicle lineup at that point.&nbsp;</p><p>The automaker said it will develop 23 electrified vehicles in total over the next eight years, with 20 of those coming in the next five years alone. It&#39;s shooting for a market mix of 75 percent electrified (EV and e-Power PHEV/hybrids) in Europe, 55 percent in Japan and 40 percent in the US and China by 2030.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other part of that mix, would presumably be internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. It&#39;s worth noting that in early 2021, Nissan said that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-wants-car-models-electric-203200601.html">planned to electrify</a> every all-new car it launches by the early 2030s. Presumably, then, any ICE vehicles still available would be legacy models.&nbsp;</p><div id="0cac3b4afcbf4290805660b9ea4a8855"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UvAjCAKmYEw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Nissan will launch EVs with all-solid-state batteries (ASSB) by 2028 and ready a pilot plant in Yokohama as early as 2024, it said. That technology promises benefits like reduced charging times, but has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-14-dyson-ev-solid-state-batteries.html">yet</a> to arrive to market as expected. The company also wants to bring the cost of battery packs down to $75 per kWh by 2028 with a reduction to $65 kWh further down the road. That would be about half of what EV batteries cost last year, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-09-14/ev-battery-prices-risk-reversing-downward-trend-as-metals-surge"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. By 2030, Nissan hopes to be producing 130 GWh of batteries.</p><p>The company said it plans to expand its ProPilot driver assistance technology to over 2.5 million Nissan and Infiniti vehicles by 2026. It will also incorporate next-generation LIDAR systems &quot;on virtually every new model by fiscal year 2030.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3c649c50-50fc-11ec-a76f-30107087cd34" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="24821550-f620-39ef-a819-474f68460082"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div></figure><p>As part of Ambition 2030, Nissan also unveiled no less than four concept cars: the Chill-Out, Surf-Out, Hang-Out and Max-Out. Like most concepts, they&#39;re meant to give a taste of Nissan&#39;s future technology including self-driving, interior features and just far-out designs. However, Nissan has only shown <a href="https://global.nissannews.com/releases/release-0f1f4ed24f506b7f8039127912028dad/images/3a8d7e15c5730943b6daffe858312fa85a0e5837">images</a> of the Chill-Out as a real vehicle, with renders of the other three vehicles.</p><p>The Chill-Out (top and above) is a smallish crossover that could be an early preview of the next-generation Leaf, which Nissan <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/2025-nissan-leaf-become-compact-suv-third-generation">previously confirmed</a> would move from a hatch to a crossover style body. It will use the Ariya&#39;s CMF-EV platform and e-4orce electric all-wheel drive system, and could arrive by 2025.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d922e00-50fc-11ec-afbf-a948fb208dda" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="871e4ae0-5e05-347a-a3bc-bbd2bbfbdeb3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div></figure><p>The Surf-Out, meanwhile, is a small electric single cab pickup with a decent-sized bed and removable canopy. It would come with a dual-motor AWD setup and a variety of power outputs, offering off-road performance, utility power and extended cargo space.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d91dc50-50fc-11ec-bfde-c15f7bc38444" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="b10f6bab-c2af-3b05-882e-43bec1fbb0c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div></figure><p>Then there&#39;s the Hang-Out, which is more like a small camper van/SUV designed to &quot;provide a new way of spending time on the move.&quot; It has a completely flat floor and movable, theater-like seats, offering &quot;the comfort of your living room in a mobile space&quot; — something we&#39;ve seen with other recent EV concepts. It also offers e-4orce and advanced ProPilot features.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1e62d00-50fc-11ec-bbff-1e848ca3aa8a" alt="Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years" data-uuid="6e701883-0a06-3b71-b0c5-33079d9488b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nissan</div></figure><p>Finally, the Max-Out is a concept convertible sports car that offers &quot;superlative stability and comfort.&quot; Body roll is limited to deliver &quot;dynamic cornering and steering response&quot; to optimize handling and occupant comfort. It&#39;s supposedly lightweight with a very low center of gravity, and also offers advanced e-4orce.&nbsp;</p><p>Nissan&#39;s new plan comes as the company has grappled with internal problems, including the arrest and subsequent flight of former CEO Carlos Ghosn. In the short term, the company plans to cut 300 billion yen ($2.65 billion) in fixed costs and reduce production capacity by 20 percent as part of its &quot;<a href="https://www.thestar.com/autos/2021/01/13/looking-to-the-future-with-nissan-next.html">Nissan Next</a>&quot; plan unveiled last year.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nissan-to-invest-18-billion-in-ev-development-101834614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65fc1795-c251-46c2-a3ba-63dfbdf3dcf1</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 10:18:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638193102</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T13:38:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/48740960-50f0-11ec-bfe2-5cd2e61953c3" width="2000" height="1146" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/48740960-50f0-11ec-bfe2-5cd2e61953c3" width="2000" height="1146" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nissan]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nissan to invest $18 billion in EV development over the next five years]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cryptocurrency mining in Kazakhstan is leading to power shortages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cryptocurrency mining consumes a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/police-bitcoin-mining-weed-farm-114707991.html">massive amount of energy</a>, and that&#39;s prompting a crisis in Kazakhstan.  <em>The Financial Times</em><a href="https://www.ft.com/content/086b7ec7-f71a-4214-bfa0-5644852056f3">reports</a> the country&#39;s electrical grid operator KEGOC said it would start rationing electricity for 50 registered miners after their demand reportedly invoked an emergency shutdown mode at three power plants in October. They&#39;ll also be the first disconnected if there are grid failures, the quasi-public company said.</p><p>The energy ministry estimated that electricity demand has jumped by eight percent so far in 2021 versus the more typical one or two percent. There have been blackouts in six regions since October.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials and observers have pinned the power cuts on climbing numbers of unregistered crypto miners illegally generating currency from their homes or even factories. China&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-limits-cryptocurrency-mining-investment-180659531.html">war against cryptocurrency</a> may be partly responsible. Energy demand started climbing when mining firms moved from China in early 2021, and it jumped again when China made mining illegal this May. Electricity has been relatively inexpensive in Kazakhstan, making it a haven for companies hoping to make larger profits from crypto operations.</p><p>Kazakhstan is trying to compensate for the power shortages. It&#39;s asking a Russian energy company to supplement the national power grid, and it will charge registered miners a compensation fee of 1 tenge (about $0.0023) for every kilowatt-hour starting in 2022. Both efforts will take time, however, and this is forcing miners to either scale back or move equipment.</p><p>There are also worries the government isn&#39;t being honest about its problems. The University of Glasgow&#39;s Luca Anceshi argued to <em>The Times</em> that Kazakhstan was scapegoating miners for reliability problems with the country&#39;s electrical grid. Whether or not that&#39;s true, it&#39;s safe to say the mining demand hints at the potential problems for other countries if their local crypto production takes off.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cryptocurrency-mining-kazakhstan-power-cuts-211139867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9466995f-5677-4368-90c4-a1e06d3d9e40</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 21:11:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638193133</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T13:38:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sectors & Industries]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8da38140-5088-11ec-b15f-00af9fc9f20d" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8da38140-5088-11ec-b15f-00af9fc9f20d" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Maxim Shemetov / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A view shows equipment at the data centre of BitRiver company providing services for cryptocurrency mining in the city of Bratsk in Irkutsk Region, Russia March 2, 2021.

Adobe estimates combined Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day internet sales saw their first ever overall year-over-year decline in 2021, dipping from $9 billion in 2020 to $8.9 billion. That&#39;s not a calamitous drop, but Adobe saw it as a sign of shifting trends.</p><p>The tech firm believed the dip reflected a shift toward earlier shopping as buyers took advantage of internet deals starting as early as October. Why cram your shopping into a single day when you can take advantage of discounts weeks in advance? While Adobe expected more spending on Cyber Monday (between $10.2 billion to $11.3 billion), its data suggested the buying frenzy just wasn&#39;t as strong this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The products people were buying changed as the weekend progressed. Black Friday sales were dominated by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pots</a>, air fryers and toys, but Saturday sales were led by tech that included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">AirPods</a>, entry-level <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">iPads</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Meta Quest 2</a> and TVs from the likes of Samsung, TCL and Vizio. Game sales included <em>Just Dance 2022</em> and last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></a>.</p><p>Adobe also noticed that more people were comfortable making the final purchase from their phones. While some Black Friday shoppers were merely browsing on their phones before buying at a computer (62.2 percent of all visits were from handsets), mobile purchases represented 44.4 percent of all online Black Friday sales, a 10.6 percent jump versus 2020. Don&#39;t be surprised if many people never touch a computer for their holiday shopping in the years ahead.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-friday-sales-drop-adobe-151855092.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">67fa9f98-0314-4d26-a03a-6a466df05f20</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:18:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638112737</ingested><modified>2021-11-28T15:19:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Banking & Budgeting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e7753b0-4bc7-11ec-b5be-b0806d858eb2" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e7753b0-4bc7-11ec-b5be-b0806d858eb2" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LEREXIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[photos showing an app for online shopping on Black Friday]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[mobile application for online shopping black friday]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Squeezed' light might produce breakthroughs in nano-sized electronics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s one thing to produce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-cd-sized-disc-095039455.html">nanoscale devices</a>, but it&#39;s another to study and improve on them — they&#39;re so small they can&#39;t reflect enough light to get a good look. A breakthrough might make that possible, however. UC Riverside researchers <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/11/23/magic-wand-reveals-colorful-nano-world">have built</a> technology that squeezes tungsten lamp light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire. That lets scientists produce color imaging at an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level, rather than having to settle for molecular vibrations.</p><p>The developers modified an existing &quot;superfocusing&quot; tool (already used to measure vibrations) to detect signals across the entire visible spectrum. Light travels in a flashlight-like conical path. When the nanowire&#39;s tip passes over an object, the system records that item&#39;s influence on the beam shape and color (including through a spectrometer). With two pieces of specrtra for every 6nm pixel, the team can create color photos of carbon nanotubes that would otherwise appear gray.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This ability to compress light is notable by itself, but the inventors see it playing an important role in nanotechnology. Semiconductor producers could develop more uniform nanomaterials that find their way into chips and other densely-packed devices.

In the excerpt below, Delfanti examines the way in which our current batch of digital robber barons lean on the classic redemption myth to launder their images into that of wonderkids deserving of unabashed praise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5ff87930-47cd-11ec-bc67-889025d6ed0e" alt="The Warehouse Cover" data-uuid="bc5c2a57-a68a-35cd-bea9-48493138c8a2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pluto Press</div></figure><p><em>This is an excerpt from</em> The Warehouse: Workers and Robots at Amazon<em> by Alessandro Delfanti, available now from Pluto Press.</em></p><hr><p>Besides the jobs, trucks and concrete, what Amazon brought to Piacenza and to the dozens of other suburban areas which host its warehouses is a myth: a promise of modernization, economic development, and even individual emancipation that stems from the “disruptive” nature of a company heavily based on the application of new technology to both consumption and work. It is a promise that assumes that the society in question is willing to entrust such ambitions to the gigantic multinational corporations that design, implement, and possess technology. This myth of digital capitalism is based on a number of elements, including magical origins, heroes, and stories of redemption. Some are by now familiar to everyone: A couple of teenagers tinkering away in a garage can revolutionize or create from scratch an entire industry, generating billions in the process. The garage is an important component of this myth. Here we are not talking about the garages where <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/amazon-warehouse-mxp5/5223404c11d2212f3caf1ac3">MXP5</a> workers park their cars after a ten-hour shift in the warehouse, nor about the garages where Amazon Flex couriers store piles of boxes to be delivered. The innovation garage is the site where individuals unbounded by old habits and funded by venture capital turn simple ideas into marketable digital commodities. Nowhere does this myth run deeper than in California: William Hewlett and David Packard’s Palo Alto backyard shack is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places as “the birthplace of Silicon Valley,” while the garage of Steve Jobs’ parents’ house (where he and Steve Wozniak built the first batch of Apple computers) has been recently designated as a “historical site” by the city of Los Altos. These garages have even been turned into informal museums and receive thousands of visitors a year, some even arriving with organized tour buses. For Californian historian Mario Biagioli, the garage has become an important rhetorical device in contemporary discourses, helping mythify the origins of contemporary innovation. Masculine innovation in particular, since the garage is a strictly male space. Bezos himself started Amazon in a garage, albeit not in California—or so Amazon’s origin myth goes: in 1994 he left his lucrative but dull Wall Street hedge fund job and wrote a business plan while driving cross-country from New York to Seattle, where he used his and his family’s money to start the company.</p><p>The myth of the redemption and success of the hero entrepreneur trickles down to the warehouse, insofar as Amazon presents work to its employees through the frame of emancipation. The idea of redemption through work is nothing new. On the contrary, it is a damnation common to modern society. In the early 1960s, militant sociologist Romano Alquati pointed out that the culture of mid-20th century Italian factories included the construction of a “myth” or “cult” of emancipation. In this instance, it was directed at the masses of migrant workers who, following World War II, moved from the rural south to the north of the country to find manufacturing work with the flagship companies of the Italian postwar economic boom, such as FIAT or Olivetti. Redemption from the backwardness of rural life was ensured not only by steady paychecks and the prospect of a pension at the end of the line, but also by participation in technologically advanced production processes—the assembly line of industrial capitalism. Amazon simply repeats and updates such promises. In Italy, for example, Amazon positions itself as an employee-focused company that brings stable employment back to a precarized labor market—a boon to a labor market hit by financial crises, lackluster growth, and lack of opportunities for retraining and upskilling. So Amazon continues a historical trajectory of Italian capitalism, but imports onto the local context novel characteristics borrowed from the American digital corporation model.</p><p>Indeed, digital capitalism updates industrial capitalism’s promise of economic and social emancipation with some novel elements of its own. Rather than simply swapping out the assembly line with the robot or the algorithm, the culture of digital capitalism mixes libertarian ideology with entrepreneurial elements. At the core of this myth lies a form of individualism. The combination of new information technologies with free-market dynamics enables emancipatory potential for the entrepreneur. Furthermore, digital capitalist companies state that they exist to change the world, to make people happy, to create value for everyone and not just for investors—technological optimism at its apex. After all, how could you deliver a bad outcome when your first principle is don’t be evil, as Google’s old slogan famously put it.</p><p>Amazon extends this old myth to all its workers. Indeed, in corporate documents, the company goes so far as to state that everyone is an “owner” at Amazon. While this is quite literal in the case of engineers and executives who receive shares of the company, it can only be understood at the level of mythology for warehouse workers. A figurative or spiritual commitment to the company’s destiny. Managerial techniques used in the warehouse contribute to building this myth, as associates are asked to have fun at work and help Amazon make history, as one of its corporate slogans goes. The myth brings with it the idea that there is no alternative to digital capitalism. Only co-option, or failure for those who can’t keep up or won’t adapt or submit.</p><p>Myths are not just old stories or false beliefs. They are ideas that help us make sense of the world. The myth of digital capitalism itself is not simply fictitious, but instead has very concrete effects. For Big Tech corporations, this myth projects a positive contribution to the world, helping to attract workers and investment, and boost corporate value on financial markets. But it has other concrete effects as well. In different areas of the world, and in different communities, the myth of redemption stemming from participation in high-tech production has impacted economies and cultures. Feminist media studies scholar Lisa Nakamura recounted how, in the 1970s, electronics manufacturers operating on Navajo land in New Mexico justified the employment of Indigenous women. Labor in microchip production was presented as empowering for the crafty and docile Navajo women—assumptions derived from racist stereotyping. Italy is completely different from the Navajo Nation, and yet the idea that an imported version of American digital capitalism can be a force for collective modernization and individual emancipation is alive and well there too. Belief in this myth is evidenced in many different and even contrasting ways. Some bring resources, like the $1.5 billion state-owned venture capital fund launched in 2020 by the Italian government to support start-up companies in the hope they will foster economic growth. Others sell resources off, like when mayors of small towns with high unemployment compete to attract the next Amazon FC, offering the company both farmland newly opened up for development and a local workforce ready to staff the warehouse. Over the years, the mayors of Castel San Giovanni have described the presence of MXP5 as a force of “development” and a source of “pride” for the town. This is not unique to Italy. American mayors are routinely quoted praising the arrival of a new Amazon facility as a “wonderful” or “monumental” thing for their town.</p><p>Amazon’s corporate slogans also hedge up its myth. Central is the valorization of disruption—the idea of a hero entrepreneur defeating the gods of the past. Some of the slogans (the so-called Leadership Principles) are repeated time and again and painted everywhere in the warehouse. While Aboutamazon.com, the company’s corporate website, describes them as “more than inspirational wall hangings,” that is exactly what they sound like. Customer obsession is perhaps the most famous one, a slogan that captures the strategic goal of focusing on customers’ needs: the rest (profits, power) will follow. It also signals that workers are by design an afterthought. Other slogans are even more predictable, like Leaders are right a lot or Think big. Amazon’s myth trickles down to fulfillment centers like MXP5 in many ways. Amazon routinely conducts marketing operations aimed at finding new workers, not new customers. Billboards sporting smiling warehouse workers, recruitment events, and glowing articles commissioned by staffing agencies in the local newspaper are common sights in Piacenza, as in the areas surrounding other FCs. Social media multiplies the message. Amazon encourages employees to join its army of “ambassadors”—workers who plaster social media with positive stories about their job or videos in which they happily dance inside the warehouse. Like the FC’s walls, all these practices are soaked with the Leadership Principles: at a recruitment event near Toronto, slogans, such as Fulfilling the customer promise, were projected as part of a slideshow filled with smiling arrow logos, accompanying a presentation of more mundane details like job descriptions or benefits. “Every Amazonian who wants to be a leader,” we were told, should focus on “customer obsession” and “never settle,” and let’s not forget that Amazonians “are right a lot.” The event wrapped up with free pizza.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-warehouse-alessandro-delfanti-pluto-press-163008791.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdecff70-9242-4d0f-905f-29a9c0b05771</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 16:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637182869</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T21:01:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fd994c90-26ae-11ec-b9ff-7f1d31d64557" width="6334" height="4223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fd994c90-26ae-11ec-b9ff-7f1d31d64557" width="6334" height="4223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos arrives for his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the UK diplomatic residence in New York City, New York, U.S., September 20, 2021.

That map doesn&#39;t include any information on the structures nearer its surface, however, and we need that to be able to get a more complete picture of how the planet was formed. Now, a team of scientists was able to <a href="http://www.insight.ethz.ch/en/home/">create</a> the first detailed image of what lies right underneath the planet&#39;s surface, showing three billion years of its history, by listening to Martian winds.</p><p>More precisely, they analyzed the ambient noise (in the absence of marsquakes) collected by the seismometer that was installed by the InSight lander. On Earth, that kind of ambient seismic noise is generated by the ocean, human activity and winds, but only the last one is present on Mars. The Swiss Seismological Service (SED) and ETH Zurich have been regularly analyzing data collected by the seismometer as part of the Marsquake Service. Over the past years, SED was able to develop ways to analyze ambient noise data to define geological structures here on Earth, and those are the techniques they used on the data from InSight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on the data the tool gathered, the top three meters of InSight&#39;s landing site is made of sand, while the next 20 meters are loose material, particularly volcanic rock fissured by meteorite impacts. Underneath that sand and rock lie lava flows divided by sediments that formed when the planet experienced cold and dry conditions. Researchers believe the uppermost lava flows were deposited around 1.7 billion years ago, while the deepest ones were deposited as far back as 3.6 billion years ago at a time when there was a lot more volcanic activity on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26957-7">published</a> their study in <em>Nature</em>, and one of the things they emphasized is that it proves techniques to investigate our planet can also work on Mars.
