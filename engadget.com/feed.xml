Select the modified logo and you can play &#39;Doodle Champion Island Games,&#39; an anime-infused title featuring several sports mini-games. Google <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/doodle-champion-island-games-july-24">says</a> it&#39;s the largest interactive doodle it&#39;s ever made.&nbsp;</p><p>You control Lucky the cat in a pixel-art landscape dotted with Japanese landmarks. Once you join one of several color-coded teams you can take part in mini-games including table tennis and skateboarding. The controls are relatively straightforward, relying on various combinations of the arrow keys and spacebar. We won gold in the table tennis and pulled off kick-flips and fakies while skateboarding with ease. The doodle will stick around for the coming weeks, adding new games along the way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The cut scenes are pretty lush, too. According to Google, the interactive doodle was made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/studio4c">STUDIO4°C</a>, the Tokyo-based animation house behind feature films like <em>Tekkonkinkreet. </em>It also worked on action-adventure puzzle game<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/catherine"><em>Catherine</em></a>.

If you don&#39;t mind settling for a slightly older model, we highly recommend the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-sony-1000xm3-review.html">Sony WH-1000XM3</a>. Weeks after they dropped to $190, the wireless headphones are down another $20 at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kjzYKx">Best Buy</a> to a new low of $170.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Sony WH-1000XM3 at Best Buy - $170" href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kjzYKx">Buy Sony WH-1000XM3 at Best Buy - $170</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the XM3 a review score of 94 in September 2018 due to their excellent sound and comfort. Inside is a dedicated noise-canceling chip, the QN1, which does the heavy-lifting in terms of blocking background noise and boosting audio. For those unaccustomed to ANC, you may even notice new sounds on the tracks you love.  Audiophiles will also take to the customization offered through Sony&#39;s app that lets you fine-tune audio.</p><p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention the XM3&#39;s successors, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">XM4</a>. The newer headphones feature two major additions: Auto-pause and seamless multi-device listening. Hardly a deal-breaker when you consider they currently cost $348.&nbsp;</p><p>The XM3&#39;s design is also a crowdpleaser. The over-ear headphones come in black with bronze accents on the Sony logo and USB-C<strong>&nbsp;</strong>port. In our tests, we found the plush cushioning around the pads and headband to be significantly more comfortable than some of the alternatives. You can also fold them up when you&#39;re not using them, making them great for travel. The XM3 offer around 30 hours of battery life, more than enough for regular commuters. A well-powered USB-C connection also provides five hours of charge after just 10 minutes.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh1000xm3-headphones-deal-114006907.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">758b2f5a-4487-4ae3-aa49-e136859977d6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 11:40:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627038081</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T11:01:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5deb7cd0-eba4-11eb-a7d5-56ab875a21dd" width="675" height="402" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5deb7cd0-eba4-11eb-a7d5-56ab875a21dd" width="675" height="402" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: LG adds a mic and speaker to its high-tech air-purifying mask]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember the high-tech face masks teased during the relatively early days of the COVID-19  pandemic?

Now, a group of astronomers has <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2111/eso2111a.pdf">discovered</a> (PDF) what&#39;s believed to be a region with exomoons-in-the-making for the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/moon-forming-region-seen-around-planet-another-solar-system-2021-07-22/">first time</a>. Myriam Benisty and team from the University of Grenoble found the disk of dust — the moon-forming region — around a young exoplanet in a star system dubbed PDS 70 located 370 light years from Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The team found the first protoplanet (PDS 70b) in the system back in 2018 using European Southern Observatory&#39;s Very Large Telescope in Chile. A year later, they found another young gas giant (PDS 70c) using the same equipment. The astronomers believe based on the data they have that the star system is only 10 million years old and that both gas giants are several times bigger than Jupiter. To know more about the system, they focused all other possible instruments on it, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-14-earths-largest-telescope-supercomputer.html">Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a>. ALMA is made up of 66 short-wavelength radio dishes, and its observations made it possible to spot the dust around PDS 70c.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The disk of dust spans a distance slightly wider than that between Earth and the Sun, and there&#39;s enough mass in there for three moons the same size as ours.

The star PDS 70 is at the centre of the wide-view image on the left. Two planets have been found in the system, PDS 70c and PDS 70b, the latter not being visible in this image. They have carved a cavity in the circumstellar disc as they gobbled up material from the disc itself, growing in size. In this process, PDS 70c acquired its own circumplanetary disc, which contributes to the growth of the planet and where moons can form. This circumplanetary disc is as large as the Sun-Earth distance and has enough mass to form up to three satellites the size of the Moon.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wide and close-up views of a moon-forming disc as seen with ALMA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Corning's new Gorilla Glass protects smartphone cameras while letting in more light]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having conquered phone displays, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/corning">Corning</a> is bringing Gorilla Glass to handset cameras. The company&#39;s DX and DX+ range of damage-resistant glass will next be <a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html">available</a> for mobile camera lens covers, starting with Samsung devices. Alongside the added protection, Corning claims its tech can improve the optical performance of smartphone cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, DX glass essentially results in less light being reflected by the camera cover lens. Currently, even with the use of an anti-reflective coating, around 92 percent of transmitted light enters a smartphone camera. Corning says that with DX/DX+ on the outside a camera lens can capture 98 percent of light, helping to reduce optical issues like ghosting. These reflections are usually caused by a bright light source during daylight or in low-light conditions. Lens hoods and coatings applied to lens surfaces can help to suppress ghosting, also known as ghost reflections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some smartphone makers are already working with specialist suppliers to address the problem. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-4k-camera-pro-best-phone-in-years-150049871.html">Sony</a> and <a href="https://cn.engadget.com/vivo-x60-pro-plus-123326888.html">Vivo</a> use a Zeiss coating to boost light transmission while reducing flares, ghosting and reflections on their high-end phones.</p><p>But, Corning also offers the added benefit of durability and has strong ties with the biggest smartphone makers in the field. The company says its DX glass is scratch resistant and that DX+ approaches the resistance of Sapphire, which is used in high-end watches thanks to its Grade 9 on the Mohs scale — a system for rating the hardness of various minerals. It could even allow you to finally ditch that smartphone case.</p><p>Gorilla Glass is now featured on 8 billion devices by more than 45 major brands, according to Corning. While Gorilla Glass DX is also available on more than 30 million wearables. Recognizing its integral role as a supplier, Apple poured $450 million into the company as part of two separate investments in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-12-apple-corning-advanced-manufacturing-fund.html">2017</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-apple-investment-250-million-corning-glass.html">2019</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/corning-gorilla-glass-smartphone-cameras-091722946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b4e0d1d-7349-41e2-8619-b45434906ac4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 09:17:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627031846</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T09:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5b909ab0-eb95-11eb-a93e-359652a3312c" width="2866" height="1604" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5b909ab0-eb95-11eb-a93e-359652a3312c" width="2866" height="1604" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Corning]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Corning]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Corning]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kaseya deploys a master decryption key to unlock systems hit by REvil attack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back on July 2nd, Russia-linked ransomware group REvil <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html">staged</a> what ended up as a massive attack on IT management software giant Kaseya, as well as its clients and their customers. The group took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Kaseya software companies use to send out updates to computer networks, allowing it to distribute ransomware to as many as 1,500 businesses and organizations worldwide. Most of them are just small businesses, and some of the victims in New Zealand are schools, which aren&#39;t your typical ransomware targets. Now, Kaseya has <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/">announced</a> that it has obtained a universal decryptor and will help those &quot;impacted by the incident.&quot;</p><p>REvil originally demanded a payment of $70 million for a universal decryptor that will unlock the data owned by victims of the July 2nd attack. In mid-July, however, the group suddenly fell off the face of the internet. The critical sites it uses to communicate with victims vanished shortly after President Biden revealed that he talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin about ransomware attacks originating from his country. It&#39;s still unclear if the group disappeared from the internet as a result of that talk, of an offensive cyber operation conducted by US authorities or of something else entirely.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its announcement, Kaseya said it &quot;obtained the tool from a third party&quot; and that it worked with software company Emsisoft to confirm that it can unlock victims&#39; data.

That means that key&#39;s origin is still a mystery, though we doubt its source matters for the victims that just want to access their locked data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-master-decryption-key-revil-attack-081230168.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2a1a08e-521e-477f-9cc0-b8abacc3a64e</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 08:12:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627028018</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T08:13:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/ec8e6300-447c-11eb-9afd-751a15e105d0" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/ec8e6300-447c-11eb-9afd-751a15e105d0" width="8814" height="5876" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Worried Businessman Looking At Laptop With Ransomware Word On The Screen At The Workplace]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Person Looking At Laptop Screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's InSight probe reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s InSight lander <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-26-nasa-insight-lander-arrived-on-mars.html">arrived on Mars</a> in 2018 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-20-nasa-insight-lander-seismometer-positioned.html">learn about its interior</a> by monitoring &quot;marsquakes,&quot; and now the project is starting to really pay off. NASA has <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8996/nasas-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars/">announced</a> that researchers have mapped the red planet&#39;s interior and discovered some big surprises and major differences with Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The map is the first ever of the interior of another planet. Compared to Earth, Mars has a thicker crust, thinner mantle layer and a bigger, less dense and more liquid core than expected. That in turn suggests that Mars may have formed millions of years before our planet, when the sun itself was still not fully formed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;It gives us our first sample of the inside of another rocky planet like Earth, built out of the same materials but very, very different,&quot; University of Cambridge seismologist Sanne Cottaar (who wasn&#39;t involved in the project) told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasas-insight-lander-gives-first-look-at-mars-interior-yielding-a-big-surprise-11626976810"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. “It is impressive.”</p><p>Constructing a map from the limited data provided by InSight was no easy feat. The probe only recorded quakes from one location and has just a single seismometer, for one thing. And Mars — while seismically active — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-nasa-insight-marsquakes.html">didn&#39;t have</a> any quakes larger than around 4 on the Richter scale.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c5fa7980-eb80-11eb-b0da-6344cbeeb430" alt="NASA&#39;s Insight reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars" data-uuid="5b205496-3f87-30ea-bd61-b086e4323c7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Science</div></figure><p>Still, taking that data, along with planet&#39;s magnetism and orbital wobbles, scientists were able to create a detailed map. The planet&#39;s innermost core was found to have a diameter of around 2,275 miles, larger than previously thought. Given the mass of the planet as a whole, that implies that the iron/nickel core likely contains lighter elements like sulfur, oxygen and carbon.&nbsp;</p><p>The crust, meanwhile, was found to be very old. It was also thicker in Mars&#39; southern highlands and thinner in the northern lowlands, which may have hosted oceans long ago. On average, it&#39;s between 15 and 45 miles thick and split into several layers of volcanic rock.</p><p>The mantle between the crust and core extends roughly 970 miles below the surface. It&#39;s thinner than Earth&#39;s and has a different composition which suggests the two planets arose from different materials when they formed. This “might be the simple explanation why we don’t see plate tectonics on Mars,” ETH Zurich geophysicist and study co-author Amir Khan told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/science/mars-nasa-insight.html?smid=tw-nytimesscience&amp;smtyp=cur"><em>New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The results has given scientists new insight into not just the inside of Mars, but how rocky planets form in general. That will help them develop new theories about planet formation that could become particularly valuable in the near future, when new instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope will allow astronomers to scan exoplanets around the galaxy. NASA will reveal more about its findings in a live event <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars">later today</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasas-insight-reveals-the-first-detailed-look-at-the-interior-of-mars-071812860.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97363ad9-9af4-4317-9845-ab64a7ec69d3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 07:18:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627024698</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T07:18:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53a9a4a0-eb80-11eb-b6ab-d6bbd132ef51" width="976" height="710" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53a9a4a0-eb80-11eb-b6ab-d6bbd132ef51" width="976" height="710" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA's Insight reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA's Insight reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla Powerwall owners can sign up to help balance California's energy grid]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla has launched a new program that will allow Powerwall owners to kick power back to the grid in times of high usage.

If you bought between 1997, when Super Cruise was first introduced, and 2020, sorry but no dice, you&#39;ll have to change your own lanes like a schmuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gms-hands-free-super-cruise-is-coming-to-six-more-cadillacs-in-2022-040101614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">334503d2-f9bd-421e-ae9a-b2c0bcb1dbcd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:01:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626987074</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T20:51:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6744160-eb2d-11eb-b5dd-2e74e6ec1172" width="5700" height="3800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6744160-eb2d-11eb-b5dd-2e74e6ec1172" width="5700" height="3800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The CT4-V Blackwing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The CT4-V Blackwing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Music's lossless and spatial audio streaming arrive on Android devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has recently updated its Music app for Android, but it left out a couple of new features you may have been waiting for: support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-now-available-on-supported-devices-094540982.html">lossless streaming</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">spatial audio</a>. <em>Engadget</em> has confirmed that the tech giant has started rolling out the new high-quality streaming options, even though they aren&#39;t specifically mentioned in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.android.music&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android app&#39;s</a> release notes.&nbsp;</p><p>The company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s making the streaming options available to subscribers at no extra charge back in May, promising immersive experiences similar to what Tidal HiFi and Amazon Music HD offer. Both options arrived for Apple users back in June, but they&#39;re limited to certain albums. Apple promised to make Dolby Atmos content easy to find with curated playlists and special badges, though, and it said lossless streaming will eventually come to its entire catalog with 75 million tracks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You will need to use compatible speakers or headphones to be able to enjoy these new immersive listening experiences, though. Apple previously said that AirPods and Beats earbuds and headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as well as the speakers on the latest iPhones, iPads and Macs will work with Dolby&#39;s spatial audio. You&#39;d have to look up your device&#39;s features to make sure it can also access spatial audio streaming. Meanwhile, lossless audio requires a wired connection and won&#39;t work with wireless audio devices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-streaming-android-034510410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf10b0f1-6050-4e84-9791-0054161d95a3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 03:45:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627011977</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T03:46:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/634f0ee0-eb62-11eb-ae57-34551c2d1e28" width="1306" height="873" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/634f0ee0-eb62-11eb-ae57-34551c2d1e28" width="1306" height="873" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram tests Limits feature to curb targeted harassment]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is testing a new feature called “Limits” that allows users to lock their accounts and limit any potential interactions when they feel they’re the target of harassment.

Daily active users have increased to 293 million, which is a 23 percent growth from this time last year. That’s the best Snap Inc has seen in a while; it tops the company’s prior best of 22 percent, which happened four years ago. The number even tops Twitter’s, which recently reported 206 million daily users in the second quarter.</p><p>Overall revenue also increased by a very impressive 116 percent to $982 million, which is its strongest growth rate yet. That’s faster than even that of Twitter and Facebook, at least right now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also said that Spotlight, its TikTok-like feature that pays users for clips, has grown in popularity. Daily active users of Spotlight grew by 49 percent, and average daily content submissions have more than tripled.</p><p>Much of this growth can be attributed to pandemic lockdowns ending, as well as a much-improved Android app. In a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-q1-2021-earnings-224943122.html">prior earnings statement</a>, CEO Evan Spiegel said that  “as things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like Story posting and engagement with the Snap Map.” However, the recent surge of COVID-19 cases point toward an uncertain third quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>The company said it so far has not seen too much of a negative effect from Apple&#39;s rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html">iOS 14</a>, which forces developers to ask users permission to track their data (often used for ad-targeting). Snap&#39;s business officer, Jeremi Gorman, said that the company actually saw relatively high opt-in rates compared to the rest of the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Spiegel is hopeful that the development of the app’s augmented reality platform will drive engagement even further. Users, for example, can now &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-shopping-creators-175728100.html">try on</a>&quot; clothes and accessories using the app, and the company also unveiled a new pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html">Spectacles</a> that have AR built-in.</p><p>“We are pleased by the progress our team is making with the development of our augmented reality platform, and we are energized by the many opportunities to grow our community and business around the world,” he said. &quot;More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-earnings-210932638.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa85241e-05c8-4a1e-be59-1f80ed9e93a2</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 21:09:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626995260</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T23:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/b709e300-d8a6-11e9-b06f-00312702d819" width="5400" height="3600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b709e300-d8a6-11e9-b06f-00312702d819" width="5400" height="3600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASSOCIATED PRESS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A banner for Snap Inc. hangs from the front of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, March 2, 2017, in New York.

But it didn&#39;t change the price, which means you&#39;ll still pay at least $179 for it. However, Amazon has a new deal that knocks nearly $20 off the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:64GB Apple TV 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3kMMnFA">64GB Apple TV 4K</a>, bringing it down to $180.

It runs on an A12 Bionic processor and it supports Dolby Vision and HDR video at 60fps, plus features like AirPlay 3 and screen mirroring. While navigating the interface of tvOS is a zippy experience, most people probably won&#39;t notice a huge performance difference between the old and new models.</p><p>What&#39;s really key to the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV 4K</a> is the redesigned Siri remote. Now, we&#39;re not saying the new remote is reason enough to upgrade if you&#39;re happy with your current Apple TV, but it does fix a lot of previous complaints we had. The new Siri remote is larger and easier to use, thanks in part to a revamped directional pad that makes controlling the gadget much smoother. The pad is also touch sensitive, so you can swipe between TV show and movie options more easily. We also found Siri to be even more useful on a device like the Apple TV, since queries tend to be more direct (&quot;Play <em>The Mandalorian</em>&quot; or &quot;Show me some new horror movies&quot;) than they are when calling upon the assistant from an iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Speaking of Siri commands, you can also ask the assistant on the Apple TV 4K to show you video feeds from your security cameras. The set-top box has a HomeKit hub built in, so you can connect various smart lights, locks and cameras to it. Video feeds from cameras, for example, will show up on your TV in picture-in-picture mode, so it won&#39;t totally interrupt the show you&#39;re watching.</p><p>The Apple TV 4K will be a tough sell for some since it&#39;s more expensive that competing streaming boxes (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Ultra" href="https://amzn.to/2UvT18w">Roku Ultra</a> is only $100, and often on sale for less), but those who spend most of their time with Apple products will find its conveniences and integrations worthwhile. Plus, Apple&#39;s rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">spatial audio to tvOS</a> later this year, which means you&#39;ll be able to get full Dolby Atmos sound from the Apple TV 4K when listening with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-2021-new-siri-remote-deal-amazon-181228166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a2bf95a-d817-47e6-90d7-a54cdbf81ef5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:12:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626977550</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T18:12:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Dead Space' is being remade for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Dead Space</em> is getting a new chance at life.

Today, the secret&#39;s out. Battlefield Portal is the third mode in <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, and it&#39;s all about community interaction and user-created levels.</p><p>Battlefield Portal includes all seven maps from <em>2042</em>&#39;s All-Out Warfare mode, plus six classic environments from previous Battlefield titles. The classic maps are Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein from <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, Arica Harbor and Valparaiso from <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em>, and Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals from <em>Battlefield 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0188700-eb10-11eb-8fff-1c3463e43aca" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="36173e80-41e3-33ae-9128-0690a77f542d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>The mode features pre-programmed, reimagined experiences from these past titles, including conquest, rush and team deathmatch. All of the maps, including the classic ones, will support matches of up to 128 players on PC, Xbox Series consoles and PlayStation 5. As with <em>Battlefield 2042</em>&#39;s main All-Out Warfare mode, matches on older-gen hardware will be capped at 64 players.</p><p>Here&#39;s where it gets <em>custom</em>. Along with the updated, old-school playgrounds, Battlefield Portal includes more than 40 weapons, more than 40 vehicles, and more than 30 gadgets from three theaters of war, plus all of the related content from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. This means the M1 Garand, Panzerschreck, B17 Bomber, Spitfire, defibrillator and other fan-favorite tools are back.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e01cccc0-eb10-11eb-afed-28891fa33b79" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="5499ac24-f8f0-3f08-9d71-0ac3fe99e007"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Factions are also returning to Battlefield Portal. On top of the specialists from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, the mode features seven armies from the classic games, including the UK, US and Germany out of <em>1942</em>, and the US and Russia from <em>Bad Company 2</em>. Battlefield Portal also supports classic soldier archetypes like <em>Battlefield 3</em>&#39;s assault, recon, support and engineer roles.</p><p>All of this culminates in the Builder tool in Battlefield Portal. In Builder, players can design their own matches and share them with the community, adjusting a range of settings including the game logic itself. Players will have control over the maps and modes in their custom games, including traits like available factions, weapons and gear; the ability to toggle down sights or go prone; the size of the battle and conditions for victory.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0144140-eb10-11eb-bbb4-5de70f586e77" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="7ff3a026-e81b-3847-ba21-bf4d04d6dd20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Players won&#39;t be able to edit any of the actual maps, but overall, Portal has an extremely rich customization mode. All progress in Battlefield Portal is shared across consoles, just like stats in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Battlefield 2042</em> — including Battlefield Portal — is due out on October 22nd, for $60 on PC, Xbox One and PS4, and $70 on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. There&#39;s still one more game mode yet to be revealed, Hazard Zone. We know it&#39;s a &quot;high-stakes squad-based game type never seen before in the Battlefield franchise,&quot; and it&#39;s not a battle royale mode, but that&#39;s about it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-portal-mode-customs-180008313.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a907da5-9322-49ad-8e5b-71cf2c11dce6</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626976424</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T17:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 - Battlefield Portal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next Grid game uses the same virtual set tech as 'The Mandalorian']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/codemasters"><ins>Codemasters</ins></a> offered the first look at the next Grid game during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html"><ins>EA Play Live</ins></a>. <em>Grid Legends</em> features a story mode that mashes together live-action performances and in-game action.

Now, however, it has. The company just announced that you’ll be able to pre-order the Playdate for $179 on July 29th at 1pm ET.</p><p>Additionally, the Playdate Cover, a purple protective cover for the handheld, will also be available for pre-order for $29. If you’re going to get both, it makes more sense to just get the Playdate and Cover bundle, which is priced at $199. As for the recently announced Playdate Stereo Dock, however, that isn’t ready for pre-orders just yet as it’s still in development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a press release, Panic said that the first batch of Playdate units, which should be around 20,000, will start shipping by the end of this year. After selling this initial allotment, it will then ship subsequent orders in 2022. The company also wanted to assure customers that the Playdate will never “sell out;” you’ll just have to wait in line, as the production is adjusted based on demand.</p><p>Pre-orders will require payment upfront, but Panic says it can be cancelled at any time for a full refund. Orders are limited to two units per person. The Playdate will ship initially to the following countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. It’s also looking into selling the devices in Malaysia, where the factory is located (if you’re in Malaysia, you can fill out <a href="https://panic-inc.typeform.com/to/dyaeItXv">this form</a> so Panic can keep you posted). International shipping costs will include any duties or taxes.</p><p>If you still can’t get enough Playdate, Panic also announced that it’s debuting a new Playdate-focused podcast next week that will give you a lot more background and information about the little handheld gaming console.

The company recently announced that the Playdate will be <a href="http://play.date/">available for pre-order</a> on July 29th for $179, with a ship date of later this year. I’ve been playing with a “press preview” version of the Playdate for the past couple of weeks, and while it’s not perfect, I still think it’s an incredibly charming handheld with a lot of potential. The question is whether there’ll be enough interest — from both developers and consumers — to keep it going for the long haul.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f2756935-7bec-48db-aff9-d8139c2d00e7"/><p>For the uninitiated, the Playdate is not just Panic’s first-ever gaming handheld; it’s also the company’s first piece of hardware, period. Panic made its name making Mac software like Transmit and Coda, and has recently ventured into publishing indie games such as <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> and the yet-to-be-released <em>Nour: Play With Your Food</em>. From its inception, Panic wanted Playdate to be a different kind of handheld; instead of something mainstream like Nintendo’s Switch, it was supposed to be more like the Game &amp; Watch devices of yore, but with a modern twist. “We didn’t want it to be too cool, but we didn’t want it to be too goofy,” said Cabel Sasser, Panic’s co-founder.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thanks to a design collaboration with Teenage Engineering, known mostly for making quirky audio gear, the Playdate certainly fulfills that brief. The hardware is tiny; about the size of a stack of Post-It notes (76 x 74 x 9 mm), and has a black-and-white screen. But its most unique design feature is its fold-out crank, which acts as an additional game controller. It’s this combination of silly and adorable that adds to the Playdate’s charm, and I’ll fully admit that I fell for it the first time I tried a prototype back in 2019.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17733a20-eac0-11eb-bd7b-d2a821ab0f00" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="13493ee1-697d-35d0-8f05-2b4aff147182"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The aforementioned preview unit I have on-hand is the final hardware, though the software isn’t quite there yet. Everything is similar to how it was two years ago. The button placement is the same, with the D-pad and A and B buttons under the display, the menu button on the right, and the lock button sitting on the top (you activate the Playdate by pressing the lock button twice; pressing it again will enable standby mode). All the controls feel responsive enough, with a pleasant clickiness. On the side is the mono speaker, which is surprisingly loud and clear given its size. Underneath is a 3.5mm headphone jack plus a USB-C charging port.</p><p>Most important to me, however, was that crank, which is housed on the Playdate’s right side. To access it, simply flip it open to reveal a small rotating yellow handle, which you can then use to rotate the arm backwards or forwards. The whole contraption feels a lot more solid than I remember; the rotation feels silky smooth, but it isn’t so loose that it continues to spin when I let go. This is a good thing, as it allows for more precise control, which turns out to be quite important in certain games. Internally, the Playdate has a 180 MHz Cortex M7 CPU, 16MB of RAM, 4GB of Flash storage, Bluetooth, and 802.11 bgn 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>The Playdate is molded from what Panic says is an extremely durable engineering thermoplastic, and the screen is laminated to a hardened glass face. That aforementioned crank is also pretty solid; it’s made out of stainless steel, and the handle is plastic with a stainless steel core. The Playdate will likely survive the occasional jostle in your pocket or bag. But if you want to keep it completely free of blemishes, Panic does offer a cover for $29 (You could also purchase the Playdate bundled with the cover for $199).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d7efed0-eac0-11eb-bbfd-b5d151f35301" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="53cdb6d1-7a94-31fd-bfff-edcd79eb95d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>While I do like the hardware for the most part, I have to admit I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the screen. One of the reasons Panic chose to go with a Sharp Memory LCD was because of its super-sharp pixels that use very little power (Pebble aficionados might recall that its eponymous smartwatch used Sharp Memory LCDs as well). I agree that the black and white images do look very crisp, especially in bright sunlight. However, the Playdate lacks any kind of backlight or front light, which means it’s terrible in dim environments. Maybe it’s because I live and work in a relatively dark room, but I found this rather annoying. At one point I had to position a book light underneath the Playdate just to play a game on the couch.</p><p>I should note that the Playdate does last a long time in between charges. I’ve left it unplugged for nearly two weeks now, and even though I’ve played a few hours every day, it still has over half of its battery life left.</p><p>I also noticed an “Upside Down” mode in the Settings menu, which turns the screen, well, upside down. When asked, Sasser said that this is an experimental mode for left-handed users who want to use the crank with their left hands. He did say, however, that this is feature is still subject to change.</p><p>As wonderful as the hardware is, the real value of the Playdate is the content. Though the device costs $179, it will now come with 24 different titles instead of the initial 12 (it’ll also ship with 4GB of storage instead of 2). My preview unit only came with four games however: <em>Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure</em>, <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, <em>Saturday Edition </em>and <em>Whitewater Wipeout</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4bd93a80-eac0-11eb-bfed-b43cad792d9e" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="851100a8-7ddc-3935-a581-cfc68142cdd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I had already played <em>Crankin</em>’ a couple of years ago when I tried the Playdate for the first time. Designed by Katamari Damacy’s Keita Takahashi, the only controller in this game is the crank, which you’ll use to hurry Crankin along his path to meet his girlfriend, Crankette. Spinning it forward will move him forward, while spinning it backward will get Crankin to do the same. The trick is that you have to navigate various obstacles like bees and birds, which exist outside the flow of time. So as you rush along, you have to position Crankin in such a way that he can avoid them. For example, you’ll want Crankin to bend down to smell the flowers exactly when the bees fly overhead.</p><p>That might seem like a relatively easy premise, but the obstacles get more complicated as the levels progress, forcing me to replay them several times before I can get them right. Currently, I’m stuck on level five despite multiple attempts. Guess I’m not going to see Crankette any time soon.</p><p>I much prefer <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, which was designed by Sweet Baby Inc &amp; Friends. In this game, a girl named Prota is going to work for a cat scientist named Marbels (no that’s not a typo), but unwittingly brings her dog Minty along on her first day. Let’s just say that things don’t go well, and Minty eventually goes missing. Somehow, Prota also, uh, loses her “marbles” in the process. As Prota goes around town trying to find her dog, you answer questions by using the crank to roll a marble around an obstacle-filled construction, making sure that the marble hits the answer you want (It’s not explicitly said, but my guess is that the marble puzzle here represents Prota’s brain).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63dab4b0-eac0-11eb-bd9d-cdf334d8b531" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="eaa6c4e4-69ab-3756-9a65-ee24b76690f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I found it a little tricky to control the marble, so I ended up picking a lot of what I thought were incorrect answers. But I soon found out that there’s really no such thing as the wrong answer in this game. That’s because the weirder the answer, the more hilarious the story becomes. For example, when you’re picking the photo for Minty’s missing dog poster, one of the options is for her butt. I didn’t mean to select it, but I did so accidentally. I know this all sounds incredibly silly, and it is, but I also found the whole thing very amusing.</p><p><em>Saturday Edition</em>, on the other hand, is a lot more serious, at least on the surface. Developed by Chris Makris, this is a point-and-click style adventure game which doesn’t use the crank at all. Instead, all navigation is done via the D-pad and A and B buttons. In this game, you play the character of John Kornfield who’s had a long history with aliens, but is currently on Earth.</p><p>The game opens with him in his apartment, and the cops are knocking on the door. Using the controls, you’re able to interact with various elements in the apartment like listening to the answering machine or opening the microwave. The game suggested to me that it’s a lot wiser to exit the apartment via the fire escape instead, so I did. I’ll admit that I haven’t gotten very far in this game — I’ve so far only been to his office and the nearby shopping mall. I do find the story quite intriguing so far, but I’m going to have to sink in a few more hours before I uncover all the game’s secrets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98354360-eac0-11eb-bdf8-066e86715df8" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="4618d6d3-b649-3954-9e80-33235a5bfc54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Last but not least is <em>Whitewater Wipeout, </em>by Chuhai Labs. All you have to do here is surf for as long as possible, performing tricks along the way to earn points. Like <em>Crankin</em>, the only controller here is the crank, which you’ll use to move the surfboard. The highest score I’ve achieved so far is 35, which is not great at all. There will eventually be a global leaderboard which you can use to compare your skills to others.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, my favorite games are the ones with a heavy story element, such as <em>Lost Your Marbles</em> and <em>Saturday Edition</em>. I am not very good with hand-eye coordination, so <em>Crankin</em>’ and <em>Wipeout</em> are not really my thing. I’ll also add that after a week or so of playing the same four games over and over, I got bored pretty quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, however, the Playdate will definitely be getting more games. As part of its $179 price, the console actually comes bundled with a season’s worth of titles — 24 games in total. The first two games will start downloading the moment you activate your Playdate, and then you’ll get two games every Monday thereafter for 11 weeks.</p><p>That is, fundamentally, the sticking point with any console like this — as quirky and glorious as the hardware is, it’ll live and die in the amount of new games you can add to this on a regular basis. The indie gaming community has already embraced the Playdate wholeheartedly — tens of thousands of developers have already expressed interest in making games for it — and the company announced that they’ll be able to sell software and games that can be sideloaded to the device.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Playdate is a fairly niche device — it’s an indie handheld made for indie games — and that’s the very thing that is so appealing about it. But it’s unclear if interest in the Playdate will last beyond its initial release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/playdate-preview-170047433.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e1ecfbc-7157-4e42-93dd-f60cf005936c</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626972399</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T16:47:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
