Specifically, Angela Hession, Twitch’s vice president of global trust and safety, says the company will update its user reporting and appeals process.&nbsp;</p><p>It also plans to upgrade its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-suspicious-user-detection-announcement-000510859.html"><ins>Suspicious User Detection</ins></a> feature. The AI tool, which the company launched at the end of last year, automatically flags individuals it believes may be repeat ban dodgers. In 2022, Twitch has updates planned around how streamers can use information from that tool. As the company has indicated previously, it also plans to update its sexual content policy to clarify various aspects of it. Twitch simultaneously intends to share more and “better” educational content across its safety center and other areas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitch spent much of the latter half of 2021 trying to stop automated &quot;hate raid&quot; harassment campaigns. The attacks saw malicious individuals use thousands of bots to spam channels with hateful language, and they frequently targeted streamers from marginalized communities. In September, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sues-hate-raiders-cruzzcontrol-and-creatine-overdose-184439305.html">sued</a> CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, two of the more prolific individuals involved in those campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’ll likely never be able to eliminate [hate raids] entirely,&quot; Hession said. However, she claims Twitch  &quot;significantly&quot; cut down on the number of bots on its platform through some of its actions in 2021. In 2022, it looks to continue that work through the improvements it announced today.&nbsp;</p><p>If the company’s safety roadmap feels light on details, Hession says that’s out of necessity. “The honest and unfortunate reality is that we can&#39;t always be specific because bad actors can and have used that transparency to attempt to thwart our efforts,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the executive acknowledged Twitch needs to do a better job of communicating what it’s doing to make people feel safe on its platform. It’s easy to see why the company would say that. When it felt like the hate raids that were occurring on Twitch couldn’t get any worse, many creators banded together to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html"><ins>protest</ins></a> the lack of action they saw from the company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bd42848-2e68-4375-90d4-d4a228426c85</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:29:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642030259</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T23:31:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man works at a computer at the offices of Twitch Interactive Inc, a social video platform and gaming community owned by Amazon, in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 6, 2017.

As enthusiast and game hunter Coddy Trentuit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg8E7BVgp9w">explained</a>, the cartridge popped up in multiple frustrating online auctions and required an alliance of  generous contributors (including Forest of Illusion) before it reached people willing to share the title with the community.</p><p>You won&#39;t want to fire up <em>eSmart 2.0</em> for the riveting gameplay. As you&#39;d expect, this really is a training exercise with game elements. You learn to complete orders for counter and drive-thru customers, with videos illustrating the finer points of making Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets. It&#39;s better than a dry training video, but you&#39;ll want to fire up a game like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-17-gaming-irl-final-fantasy-tactics-overcooked.html"><em>Overcooked</em></a> if you want a genuinely fun restaurant experience.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on the training game being easily available for long given that it wasn&#39;t meant for the general public.

Platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-policy-204452958.html">Twitter</a> have adopted policies in an effort to curtail rampant false claims, but some don&#39;t have rules in place. A group of 270 doctors, nurses, scientists and educators <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/">have sent an open letter to Spotify</a> following a recent episode of <em>The</em><em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calling for the streaming service to adopt a clear policy and to fulfill its &quot;responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>On the December 31st episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who says he&#39;s one of the creators of mRNA technology. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/">unclear</a> whether that&#39;s true. During the chat, Malone made baseless claims about COVID-19, including the idea that &quot;mass formation psychosis&quot; led people to believe the vaccines were effective and the notion that President Biden had withheld data that supported ivermectin as a valid treatment. The episode quickly went viral among both critics and fans as Rogan averages over 10 million listeners per episode. YouTube <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-rogan-podcast-youtube-robert-malone-b1986008.html">removed a video of the interview</a> and Malone was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/31/prominant-virologist-kicked-off-twitter-for-spreading-anti-vaxx-video-15844655/">banned from Twitter</a> for violations of the platform&#39;s COVID-19 misinformation policy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,&quot; <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">the letter explains</a>. &quot;[The episode] is not the only transgression to occur on the Spotify platform, but a relevant example of the platform’s failure to mitigate the damage it is causing.&quot;</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"><em>The Verge reported</em></a> that Spotify was okay with a Rogan episode on which he encouraged 21-year-olds to not get vaccinated. A company source indicated the message wasn&#39;t &quot;outwardly anti-vaccine&quot; and he didn&#39;t &quot;make a call to action,&quot; <em>The Verge&#39;s </em>Ashley Carman wrote at the time. Spotify has taken down more explicit examples of vaccine misinformation, including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ian-brown-says-spotify-have-taken-down-his-anti-lockdown-song-little-seed-big-tree-2899613">a song from musician Ian Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/pete-evans-spotify-ban-2021-1">a podcast from Pete Evans</a>. The company has said in the past that it &quot;prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.&quot; And that when something violates those guidelines, it is removed.</p><p>However, as this open letter points out, Spotify doesn&#39;t have an official misinformation policy like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others. The group is asking for the platform to do just that, rather than to directly take action against Rogan or remove the episode in question. They want the company to create rules that would hold podcast creators accountable for the content of their shows.</p><p>Spotify paid a reported $100 million to lock down <em>The Joe Rogan Experience </em>as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">an exclusive podcast</a> in 2020. The show was the most popular on the platform in 2021, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html">both in the US and globally</a>. When Rogan faced criticism over his choice of guests, including another example of pandemic misinformation in an episode with Alex Jones, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ceo-editorial-responsibility-podcasts-040340113.html">didn&#39;t have editorial responsibility</a> over podcasts.</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of really well-paid rappers on Spotify too, that make tens of millions of dollars, if not more, each year from Spotify.&quot; <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-talks-future-of-podcasts-93925d11-d002-478b-81fb-c371743f6c3c.html">Ek told Axios</a><em>.</em> &quot;And we don&#39;t dictate what they&#39;re putting in their songs, either.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify didn&#39;t respond to Engadget&#39;s request for comment on both the open letter and the company&#39;s misinformation policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-health-misinformation-covid-19-open-letter-215921304.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f8ba7181-ef64-4b91-90a7-f5f1932ab7ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:59:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642026567</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T22:29:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carmen Mandato via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 10: Joe Rogan introduces fighters during the UFC 269 ceremonial weigh-in  at MGM Grand Garden Arena on December 10, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We recently highlighted the Wyze Cam V3 as our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html"><ins>favorite overall home security camera</ins></a>, thanks to its low price and handy selection of features. Although a subscription isn&#39;t totally necessary for the company&#39;s cameras, it does offer extra utility. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wyze/"><ins>Wyze</ins></a> is opening up a new subscription tier to everyone.</p><p>The <a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"><ins>Cam Plus Lite plan</ins></a> includes AI-powered Person Detection (instead of motion detection) and 12-second event recordings. Here&#39;s the twist: it&#39;s a pay-what-you-want plan, so you&#39;ll have access to those features without having to pay a monthly or annual fee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The existing Cam Plus plan costs $2 per month or $15 per year. It supports back-to-back event recordings (instead of one every five minutes). Other features include full-length video recording for as long as motion is detected, and package, vehicle and pet detection.</p><p>Until now, Wyze cameras have captured 12-second clips as often as every five minutes when they detect an event, and those recordings are stored for up to 14 days. Wyze is moving that feature to its subscriptions, though, you&#39;ll need to opt in to the Cam Plus or Cam Plus Lite plan to keep using cloud recordings.</p><p>Wyze says it&#39;s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/wyze-cam-plus-lite-subscription/">pairing</a> cloud recordings with the AI-powered Person Detection feature in the Cam Plus Lite plan to make them more useful and cut down on unnecessary notifications that might be triggered by a clip of, say, an insect flying in front of the camera. The company believes this approach will improve the overall experience, though it said it will incur significant cloud costs as a result. As such, while it won&#39;t make users pay for those features, it&#39;s hoping they&#39;ll contribute what they can to help cover the costs for everyone.</p><p>If you don&#39;t <a href="https://services.wyze.com/purchase/type/person-detection">opt in</a> to Cam Plus Lite, your cameras will store thumbnails of what they detect, rather than video.

Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements">shared</a> a rulemaking proposal that would introduce stricter requirements for data breach reporting. Most notably, the new rules would require notifications for customers affected by &quot;inadvertent&quot; breaches — companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html">leave data exposed</a> would have to be just as communicative as victims of cyberattacks.</p><p>The requirements would also scrap a mandatory one-week waiting period for notifying customers.

There&#39;s no guarantee the Commission will greenlight the new requirements. It won&#39;t be surprising if the rulemaking moves forward, however. While companies are now more likely to disclose breaches, there have been multiple high-profile incidents where those firms took too long to alert customers or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-ny-attorney-general-sues-dunkin-cyberattacks.html">didn&#39;t notify them at all</a>.

The patch addresses a vulnerability found within the company’s HomeKit protocol for connecting disparate smart home devices. The bug allowed malicious individuals to force an iPhone or iPad to repeatedly crash and freeze by changing the name of a HomeKit-compatible device to include more than 500,000 characters. Since iOS backs up HomeKit device names to iCloud, it was possible for iOS users to get stuck in an endless loop of crashes.</p><p>Security researcher <a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"><ins>Trevor Spiniolas</ins></a> discovered the vulnerability and publicly disclosed it on January 1st. According to Spiniolas, he informed Apple of the bug back in August. The company had reportedly planned to address the vulnerability before the end of 2022 but later delayed a fix to early 2022. “I believe this bug is being handled inappropriately as it poses a serious risk to users and many months have passed without a comprehensive fix,” Spiniolas said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spiniolas found that the vulnerability is present within Apple’s mobile operating system as far back as iOS 14.7, but said he believes it exists in all versions of iOS 14.

Netflix was still the frontrunner with one or more <a href="https://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/28th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards">nominations</a> in nearly every category, including multiple picks for <em>The Power of the Dog</em> (three) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> (four) as well as individual nods for productions like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dont-look-up-review-dicaprio-climate-change-180058853.html"><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em></a>, <em>Passing</em> and <em>Halston</em>. However, Apple also fared particularly well this year — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a> received five nominations, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-show-season-2-teaser-apple-tv-plus-141241307.html"><em>The Morning Show</em></a> racked up four. <em>Coda</em> and the not-quite-released <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em> also burnished Apple&#39;s image.</p><p>Other services also had their due. Amazon had success with titles like <em>Being the Ricardos</em> and <em>The Tender Bar</em>, while Disney&#39;s empire made its presence felt with nominations for <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> and Disney+ series like <em>Loki</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix also broke a cultural boundary — <em>Squid Game</em><a href="https://twitter.com/squidgame/status/1481300075989303297">is the first</a> non-English series to receive a SAG nomination, not to mention the first Korean series. This isn&#39;t completely surprising given Netflix&#39;s eagerness to produce worldwide blockbusters, but it&#39;s notable given how difficult it has been for foreign releases to crack these awards.</p><p>Theater- and TV-first material still has a significant presence in SAG&#39;s nominations. Nonetheless, it&#39;s evident the partial return to normalcy in entertainment only had a limited effect — streamed shows are still thriving in the current awards landscape.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sag-awards-2022-nomintions-netflix-apple-amazon-191041019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">281ca81b-3d48-4f0a-918b-e9b2595db6df</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 19:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642014642</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T19:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noh Juhan/Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds bitmoji reactions and threaded replies to chats]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/snapchat"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> is ringing in the new year with a bunch of new features.

On Wednesday, the White House said it would allocate billions toward projects that lead to the construction of more wind, solar and geothermal energy across the country.</p><p>Specifically, the administration announced it’s moving forward with the lease of six commercial areas off the coasts of New York and New Jersey for use in wind farm projects. On offer is more than 488,000 acres of ocean seafloor for the winning bidders to build an estimated 5.6 and 7 gigawatts of clean power generation. As part of the bidding process, the White House says it will incentivize participants to support labor jobs and to source turbine components from American manufacturers. The New York Bight development is one of the primary pillars of the Biden administration’s plan to build out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-off-shore-wind-plan-204820118.html">30 gigawatts of offshore wind production by 2030</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another significant facet of today’s announcement is the “Building a Better Grid” initiative. Pulling from the $65 billion Congress set aside for power grid upgrades when it passed President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, the initiative earmarks $2.5 billion toward funding the installation of new transmission lines. It’s putting another $3 billion toward an expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, which supports projects that increase the capacity and flexibility of existing electrical infrastructure.</p><p>The administration notes it will also allocate $10 billion in grants to states, tribes and utility companies to help those groups strengthen their local transmission lines. Taken together, the investments will help modernize the country’s power grid, making it easier to transport renewable energy from remote generation sites to where it’s needed most. It will also harden the power grid against the kind of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-cold-snap-outage-193054181.html">extreme weather events</a> that have become more commonplace as the effects of climate change have worsened.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees the White House putting forward meaningful climate policy, but if the Biden administration is to have a chance of meeting the president’s ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-10/how-joe-biden-s-2035-green-energy-grid-could-work">decarbonizing the country’s power grid by 2035</a>, it will need to bypass the legislative gridlock that has left the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/">Build Better Back Framework</a> in limbo. Much of that will depend on whether the White House can convince Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support the approximately $1.75 trillion climate and social spending bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-climate-change-policy-181033816.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ee13fdb-3f9b-49e6-9407-165c9e47ee26</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 18:10:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642013684</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:55:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZHOUSHAN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 24, 2021 - An aerial photo taken on November 24, 2021 shows wind turbines rotating under sea breeze at a wind farm in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, China.

That, in turn, has led to some ImageRunner multifunction printers incorrectly <a href="https://twitter.com/ErickStarren/status/1480258812275671042">flagging</a> official cartridges as knockoffs — Canon has even told printer owners how to bypass the warnings and deal with broken toner level detection.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Canon for comment. Some users said they&#39;ve encountered similar issues with HP printers, but  that company wouldn&#39;t directly confirm or deny the problems in a statement to <em>The Register</em>. Instead, HP said it was using a &quot;globally diverse&quot; supply network to stay &quot;agile and adaptable&quot; in the midst of chip shortages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The printer trouble illustrates one of the common complaints about digital rights management (DRM) and other copy protection systems: they create trouble the moment their designers can&#39;t offer full support.

The company stressed there was no shortage of the cartridges themselves — American customers still had a &quot;continuous supply.&quot; You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p><em>While the global shortage of semiconductor components continues to affect many industries, it’s our priority to limit possible disruption to our customers. As with all manufacturers, we continually monitor our supply chain to anticipate and prepare for any potential disruption and we are taking steps to deal with the situation, such as adjusting product designs. One example of this is in toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices (imageRUNNER/imageRUNNER ADVANCE) as we are currently facing a shortage of the chip that is fitted inside the toner cartridge to monitor its remaining toner levels. There is no shortage of toner cartridge itself – a shortage of the chip that lies inside the toner cartridge. As such, we’re now shipping toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices without this chip to ensure we’re still providing a continuous supply of consumables to our Canon U.S.A. customers. We have also issued guidance on how to install and manage these new toner cartridges.</em></p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-printer-ink-cartridge-false-fake-claims-161752274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c78161c1-e036-4048-baad-e5e087115abc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:17:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642010805</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:06:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Irritated young businesswoman looking at printer machine at office]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Irritated Businesswoman Looking At Printer Machine At Office]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' is delayed until December 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans will need to wait several more months than expected to get their hands on the latest game in the series.

It was the company’s first foray into fully customizable keyboards, and we liked it a lot. Today it’s the turn of <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard">the Q2</a>, which is a smaller (65% or no “function key”) version of the Q1. Despite the reduced footprint, it retails for the same price, starting at $149 for the barebone or $169 if you want it fully assembled – cheaper than much of the competition.</p><p>When we tested the Q1 we liked it a lot. It offered the same level of configuration as the much-loved GMMK Pro for about $100 less. That said, the selling point of the GMMK Pro (in this author’s opinion) is all about those luxurious “Lubed Panda” switches and the firm, responsive typing experience. The “Panda” is GMMK’s own “switch” which for those that don’t hang out at <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-gmk-hennessey-custom-keycap-set">Drop</a> and/or use a “mech” are the mechanical part of the key – the important bit, really, as that’s mostly what will define how the keyboard “feels.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with the Q1, the Q2 is compatible with <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA</a> configuration software (and thus QMK) which easily allows you to remap keys to almost anything, create macros and more. Also like the Q1 (and the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black">GMMK Pro</a> and increasingly others) there’s the option to replace the top-right-most key (Insert) with a clickable rotary for volume and media control.</p><p>I’ll admit, after using the GMMK Pro for a while now, I find the Gateron Reds that came with the Q2 a little flacid by comparison, but that’s the joy of a customizable keyboard, you can use whatever switches you like (or change out more or less any other part). You could even load it with the Pandas if you wish, though that would require a (lot of) extra spend.</p><p>The Q2 remains USB only (no wireless) but is still compatible with either Windows or Mac and the corresponding OS-specific keycaps are included in the box. It’s also just as rugged and well built as the Q1 with the all-metal casing. You can choose between three colors thereof: Black, gray and navy blue.</p><p>Ultimately, the selling point of the Q2 boils down to whether you prefer a compact keyboard or to have access to physical function keys (they’re still accessible here with shortcuts obviously).</p><p>The Q2 is also joined by some other relatively new additions. Keychron is prolific if nothing else.

It also features Logitech&#39;s TrueSoft technology, which promises cinematic color accuracy and enables a soft, flattering light that can apparently make streamers look less, well, tired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether it can truly provide a &quot;radiant&quot; look across all skin tones remains to be seen. Different skin tones require different approaches to lighting on video — using the same lighting for white actors, for instance, had made Black actors look ashy or barely visible during dimly lit scenes in movies and shows <a href="https://fashionmagazine.com/flare/insecure-lighting/">for a long time</a>. One of the creators Logitech got to talk about Litra Glow, however, is Black visual artist and photographer Aundre Larrow, who once shared tips on how to photograph darker skin tones in an article he <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/discover/article/10-tips-for-photographing-darker-skin-tones">wrote for Adobe</a>. Larrow said of Litra Glow:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The lighting looked natural. It looks good on my skin and works for people of different skin tones without looking blown out. The warm to cool is super accurate and I found light to be strong and soft enough to use on its own.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ring lights and streamer lights have become a lot more popular thanks to the rise of game streaming services like Twitch, but also to provide lighting for creators on YouTube and TikTok. Elgato already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-ring-light-130016714.html">a Ring Light and Key Light</a> for streamers, but they are a lot more expensive than Logitech&#39;s new device.&nbsp;</p><p>Logitech designed Litra Glow to be plug-and-play, and streamers can choose between five presets with different brightness and color temperature. If they want to customize it further, they can adjust those settings on their own. They can also connect it to Logitech&#39;s G HUB software to create their own presets and assign them to the G Keys on a Logitech G keyboard or mouse.

Now, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said that federal agencies spent $684 billion on coal plant carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that have mostly failed, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-energy-department-blew-1-1-billion-on-carbon-captu-1848338427"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported. It also spent $438 million on other three CCS industrial projects, two of which were cancelled.</p><p>&quot;DOE [Department of Energy] provided nearly $684 million to eight coal projects, resulting in one operational facility,&quot; according to the GAO report. &quot;DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.</p></blockquote><p>Not only did the Department of Energy use a &quot;high-risk selection&quot; method to choose projects, it negotiated and funded them too expeditiously, according to the report. Coal negotiations lasted just three months instead of the usual year &quot;based on DOE&#39;s desire to begin spending American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds quickly.&quot; On top of that, it bypassed the usual cost controls and supported projects &quot;even though they were not meeting required key milestones.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The DOE recently said that it wants to dramatically reduce the cost of carbon capture technology via a program called <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot">Carbon Negative Shot</a>. The aim is to remove CO2 directly from the air and sequester it underground at a cost of less than $100 per ton, deploying it at the gigaton scale.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the easiest and cheapest way to cut gigatons of emissions would be to retire costly coal plants completely, according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report">report last year</a> the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). That&#39;s because the costs of renewable energy have plunged in the last decade, making them effectively cheaper than coal. And of course, adding CCS tech to coal would increase costs considerably. All that said, coal and fossil fuels are a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/07/republicans-fossil-fuels-coal">charged political subject</a> in the US, despite the global risks of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the GAO recommended more congressional oversight for DOE expenditures on CCS. &quot;Absent such a mechanism, DOE is at risk of expending significant funds on CCS demonstration projects that have little likelihood of success.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-spent-11-billion-on-failed-carbon-capture-projects-111225335.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c80f7a5f-9dd9-44c1-9dd5-497fc74445ab</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:12:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641985946</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T11:12:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Trish Badger / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Petra Nova CCS Facility at NRG Power Plant in Richmond, Texas, U.S., May 18, 2018.
