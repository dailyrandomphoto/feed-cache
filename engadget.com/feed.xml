They&#39;re organizing under the auspices of the Alphabet Workers Union, a year-old division of the Communication Workers of America which is seeking to represent employees and contractors at all level of Google&#39;s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>The 11 workers — 10 of whom have signed cards since the union drive began in October — are jointly employed by Google and a staffing agency called BDS Connected Solutions. That&#39;s not out of the ordinary, as staffing arrangements with Alphabet go: a 2019 story in the <em>New York Times</em> found temps and contractors made up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html">the majority</a> of the tech giant&#39;s workforce, while a <em>Recode</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/31/18644866/google-contractors-pay-ratings-glassdoor">report</a> that same year indicated that this second class of laborers earned significantly less than Google&#39;s own full-time employees. According to two BDS workers who spoke to Engadget, customer representatives had been feeling left out of key conversations about staffing and safety protocols, and communication with management has deteriorated.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We started off by just asking, &#39;Hey, how do you feel about this idea? Do you feel like you have enough say, in the conditions that you work in?&#39; We basically received a unanimous &#39;No, I don&#39;t feel like we do,&#39;&quot; Emrys Adair told Engadget. &quot;It hasn&#39;t always been like this,&quot; Mike Knox, who has been a Google Fiber representative for several years, said &quot;the general relationship between management and the workers. It used to be closer.&quot; Kansas City was the very <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-fiber-1-gigabit-internet-launches-in-kansas-city/">first market</a> Google Fiber launched in, nearly a decade ago.</p><p>What makes this push to form a bargaining unit somewhat unusual, however, has been the decision to skip straight to petitioning the National Labor Relations Board. Typically, this is the longer, more arduous option when an employer refuses to voluntarily recognize a union. But, according to Adair, Alphabet and BDS have neither attempted to quash the union drive, nor expressed a willingness to recognize it.&quot;There&#39;s been no acknowledgement, no pushback. no response at all yet,&quot; they said. Google and BDS have not responded to requests for comment from Engadget.</p><p>Like many workplaces in recent years, these service representatives have cycled through closures, reduced hours and the occasional need to isolate and work remotely when a colleague tests positive for COVID-19. While they weren&#39;t keen to give too many specifics as to what they&#39;d hope to secure in a first contract, one of the  benefits they&#39;re seeking to obtain is hazard pay. &quot;As far as the actual COVID precautions go, they&#39;ve done a pretty alright, job,&quot; Adair said. &quot;Our main concern is just that we&#39;re still working in the store in person in a pandemic, which in and of itself, no matter how you do that is a risk.&quot;</p><p>It may be months or years before the NLRB makes a ruling on these workers&#39; right to form a bargaining unit. In the meantime, Knox hopes it might spur action from others within Google Fiber. &quot;We&#39;re really hoping that this inspires in that regard,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re hoping that&#39;s a flashpoint where other people can see that and decide to push for more input.&quot;</p><p><em>Are you a Google employee, TVC or contractor?

As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac&#39;s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it&#39;s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM&#39;s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.”</p><p>As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can&#39;t avoid it, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they&#39;ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-innerspace-autonomous-concept-car-201347425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bcca169-048b-4aa6-8396-c2bd55d7f184</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 20:13:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641413060</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T20:04:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cadillac expands its vision of personal autonomous future mobility with the InnerSpace concept â a dramatic, two-passenger electric and autonomous luxury vehicle.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cadillac Innerspace]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive reveals a VR wrist tracker for the Focus 3 headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC Vive" href="https://fave.co/3JJAKJk">HTC Vive</a> has revealed a wrist tracker for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">Focus 3 headset</a>. The device is 85 percent smaller and 50 percent lighter than the Vive Focus 3 controller.</p><p>The brand says the wearable can track your arm from fingertips to elbow. The Focus 3&#39;s cameras can monitor LEDs for standalone tracking. As such, attaching the Wrist Tracker to an object allows the headset to track it with six degrees of freedom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the help of high-frequency IMU (inertial measurement unit) data and an advanced kinematic model, Focus 3 will still know the exact position of your hand and wrist when the tracker isn&#39;t in the cameras&#39; line of sight. It can predict your pose too, so if you, for instance, reach behind your head with a tennis racket to play a smash shot, the headset should still have a good idea of what you&#39;re doing.</p><p>The Vive Wrist Tracker will be released in early 2022, starting in the US.

Mosseri said that the main feed would “have more and more recommendations over time.” The company has already been testing adding recommendations from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-suggested-posts-feed-191126529.html"><ins>non-followed accounts</ins></a> and Reels into its main feed, so it sounds like Instagram plans to double down on these efforts. Last week, Mosseri said the company was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-2022-priorities-video-creators-transparency-messaging-adam-mosseri-213020718.html"><ins>going to</ins></a> “rethink what Instagram is” in 2022, and would focus on Reels and building more tools for creators.</p><p>For now, the new feed changes won’t be rolling out widely. Mosseri said the new feed tests “are already out or going out over the next couple of weeks,” with the “full experience” expected to launch for everyone in the “first half of this year.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tests-chronological-feed-181947259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8921cbdd-4bd0-49c8-8f65-05dfcb67cd9f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641406787</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T18:19:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/07d62b60-6e53-11ec-bbe7-17acef150778" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/07d62b60-6e53-11ec-bbe7-17acef150778" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Instagram logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 13, 2021 (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[App Photo Illustrations]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo will debut its 'self-driving' Ride Pilot feature in California]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volvo will debut “Ride Pilot,” its take on a Tesla-like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">autonomous driving feature</a>, in California, the automaker announced on Wednesday during CES 2022. Once it’s approved for use on highways, Volvo says it will offer Ride Pilot as a paid subscription add-on for a new electric SUV it plans to reveal later this year. It will later bring the feature to other markets globally.</p><p>The company worked with Zenseact and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-luminar-lidar-built-in-self-driving-cars-161838644.html">LiDAR developer Luminar</a> to create Ride Pilot, and it’s currently testing the feature in Sweden. As you might guess from Luminar’s involvement, Ride Pilot will utilize LiDAR technology, an approach that puts Volvo at odds with Tesla. CEO Elon Musk famously called the tech a “crutch” during a 2018 earnings call. According to Volvo, Ride Pilot will utilize a Luminar Iris LiDAR sensor complemented by eight cameras, 16 ultrasonic sensors and five radars to enable the software to judge depth. Additionally, the company says it will push out continuous over-the-air updates to ensure the feature is safe to use.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“When we say self-driving, we mean self-driving. So this will be a feature or function where the car is actually responsible for the driving so you will not need to keep your hands on the steering wheel and you will not need to keep your eyes off the road,” said Martin Kristensson, head of AD and mobility at Volvo.</p><p>Volvo says it will start testing Ride Pilot in California by the middle of 2022. It picked the state for its favourable regulatory stance on autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ride-pilot-181545657.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b27f6d60-f353-4111-8e52-d16485b1aff3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:15:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641408917</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T18:55:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd19e8b0-6e52-11ec-bf4c-1aada46c0efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd19e8b0-6e52-11ec-bf4c-1aada46c0efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Volvo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Volvo Ride Pilot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Volvo Ride Pilot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo is bringing YouTube and Google Home integration to its vehicles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/volvo/">Volvo</a> says it will be the first automaker to offer direct integration with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20home/">Google Home</a> in its cars. You&#39;ll be able to control certain functions remotely via Google Assistant. You might tell your phone to lock the doors or ask a smart speaker to start warming up your car as you&#39;re getting ready to leave home.</p><p>Two-factor authentication is needed for &quot;more sensitive commands,&quot; like unlocking the doors. You can also learn info related to your car through Google Assistant.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More features will be added later, such as the option to schedule charging. Volvo will roll out Google Home integration in the coming months. To use it, you&#39;ll need an Android-powered infotainment system that&#39;s connected to the Volvo Cars app and a Google Assistant-enabled device.</p><p>It&#39;s not the first time we&#39;ve seen integration with connected home platforms in cars. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-amazon-alexa-newer-gm-vehicles-2020.html">GM</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-bmw-cars-will-offer-alexa-voice-control-in-2018.html">BMW</a> owners can control smart home devices from vehicles with built-in Alexa, while Samsung and Google brought a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smartthings-car-android-auto-163600196.html">SmartThings dashboard</a> to some models with Android Auto. Still, Google Home is one of the more prominent connected home platforms around. If you have a smart speaker with Google Assistant enabled, these features might come in useful.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> will be the first video streaming service on Volvo&#39;s infotainment system. You&#39;ll be able to download the app from the Play Store. The automaker offers unlimited data in certain markets, so you might be able to watch as many videos as you like without worrying about busting your data allowance.</p><p>For safety reasons, you&#39;ll only be able to watch YouTube videos on the screen when the car&#39;s stationary. That will ensure Volvo avoids the kind of controversy Tesla was embroiled in recently, when it emerged that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">games were playable</a> on the infotainment system while a car was moving.

It&#39;s announcing a set of news today <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces%202022/">at CES 2022</a> that are designed to help those using non-Apple devices easily set up, connect and share seamlessly across platforms. That involves expanding its existing Fast Pair and Chromecast capabilities to more products, as well as improving the sharing of data between Android phones and laptops. In fact, Google said that &quot;for the first time with Android, we&#39;re also focused on building for other platforms, like Windows.&quot;</p><p>First, Fast Pair. Google is working with Acer, HP and Intel to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-android-fast-pair-will-quickly-connect-bluetooth-devices.html">Fast Pair</a> to Windows PCs so you can quickly connect your Android phone to your laptop. You can then set up Bluetooth accessories, sync your text messages and easily share files via Nearby Share. This feature will arrive on select Windows PCs later this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Google is also bringing Fast Pair to devices beyond wearables, cars and Bluetooth audio accessories, to include things like TVs and smart devices. It already works with the Pixel Buds and some Fitbit watches, enabling easier setup on those devices. In a few weeks, your Chromebook can automatically detect your Fast Pair-enabled headphones when you turn them on, allowing you to connect to them in a single click. New Chromebooks arriving later this year will be easier to set up, too. You can connect your Android phone and port over saved data like your Google account and Wi-Fi password.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f981ae20-6e4f-11ec-b76f-3a26ba3bb028" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="A pop-up dialog on an Android TV asking if the user wants to connect their detected Pixel Buds." data-uuid="3506705b-67bb-3376-a2e0-01edec5dc94e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The company said it&#39;ll let you connect headphones to Google TV or Android TV in the coming months, and that Fast Pair will work with new Matter-enabled smart home devices as well. That should make adding connected appliances to your home network easier than before. It doesn&#39;t sound as simple as Apple&#39;s HomePod setup where you can just hold your iPhone near your speaker to trigger the installation process, but we&#39;ll have to wait to see Google&#39;s solution in action to know for sure.</p><p>After your gadgets are all set up and synced with each other, Google also wants to enable convenient connections a la Apple&#39;s AirPlay or AirDrop. It&#39;s bringing Cast support to more brands, starting with all Bose smart speakers and soundbars, so you can stream music and audio from your Android phone to compatible speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also &quot;building a technology for Bluetooth-enabled headphones&quot; that will let them automatically switch audio output depending on what device you&#39;re using. Say you&#39;re wearing earbuds while watching a show on your Android tablet and a call comes in on your phone. The system will pause your movie and the headphones will switch over to your phone, then go right back to your tablet when your conversation is over. This will work for all audio playing through your devices at a system level, rather than on a supported-app-only basis. For Apple users, this is similar to how AirPods can automatically switch between iPads, iPhones and Macs.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/27af1f30-6e50-11ec-8ff8-0a706ce97196" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="An animation showing how audio switching between an Android tablet and phone works when a call comes in on the latter." data-uuid="6ea12a4e-1bd7-3451-9ca8-96194997ef6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google says compatible headphones will also get spatial audio support so you can hear directional sound based on your head&#39;s movements for more immersive experiences. These features are coming in the next few months.</p><p>Later this year, Phone Hub on Chromebooks is also getting new features to make it more useful. For example, you won&#39;t have to install separate apps like Signal or WhatsApp on your laptop to message your friends via your phone anymore. Messages from chat apps will show up on your Chromebook and you can reply to them from there. Google is also adding Camera Roll to the Phone Hub so you can view your media without opening photos.google.com.&nbsp;</p><p>Locking and unlocking devices and vehicles is also getting easier. Just like you can with Apple Watch (and some Samsung devices), in the coming months you&#39;ll be able to use your paired Wear OS 3 watch to keep your Chromebook and Android devices unlocked when you&#39;re close by.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4f562f10-6e50-11ec-bb7f-21e9cc976633" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="An animation showing a phone and a Chromebook. When a message appears on the phone, a small window pops up on the bottom right of the Chromebook." data-uuid="72db0759-407b-3d8e-8751-a297cba901e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cars are also getting an Android update. Compatible Samsung or Pixel phones will now be able to lock, unlock and start supported BMW vehicles. Later this year, too, phones with ultra wideband support can open car doors without leaving your pocket or purse. Google is also adding support for key sharing, in compliance with the Connected Car Consortium interoperable standard, so you can remotely share access to your vehicle right from your phone. The company said it&#39;s &quot;working to bring digital car keys to more Android phones and vehicles later this year.&quot;</p><p>Finally, you&#39;ll also be able to tell the Google Assistant to warm up, cool down, lock and unlock your car and ask it for the amount of battery left in your EV. This is coming first to Volvo Cars vehicles in the coming months, &quot;with more to follow,&quot; according to Google.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything Google announced today fits in with the vision of ambient computing the company has talked about for years. &quot;This is sort of a foundational element for us to achieve the vision of ambient computing,&quot; vice president of multi-device experiences Erik Kay told Engadget. It does seem like when these updates do roll out, non-Apple users may have less reason to envy the seamless ecosystem that iPhone or Mac users enjoy.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ces-2022-news-fast-pair-nearby-share-windows-chrome-cast-180055389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a522fec6-f6bd-4193-b36a-e759b8061bea</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641405304</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T17:55:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a5f92af0-6e4d-11ec-9f7f-19c3c871d8f2" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a5f92af0-6e4d-11ec-9f7f-19c3c871d8f2" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A banner showing a Chromebook, Android phone, smartwatch, tablet and part of a TV, surrounded by Google-style illustrations of icons for microphone, camera and GPS.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Multi Device banner]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer’s latest absurd concept is a modular workstation with a 65-inch OLED]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CES wouldn’t be the Consumer Electronics Show without <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer" href="https://fave.co/3uDrIp3">Razer</a> bringing at least one prototype product to the event. This year was no different with the company using the annual trade show to unveil Project Sophia, a concept modular gaming desk. In its current iteration, the table includes room for 13 separate modules. These can be used to add components like touchscreen hotkey panels, external capture cards and audio mixers to Project Sophia, thereby allowing you to modify the station to your needs. Razer claims it’s possible to reconfigure the table “in seconds.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9fa48820-6e4d-11ec-bfb9-5bcaf2e93952" alt="Project Sophia" data-uuid="72a4f81b-ee43-3060-96ba-ade1a0f25950"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>The computer that powers everything is housed in a chassis that magnetically snaps underneath Project Sofia’s glass tabletop surface. Razer says it features the latest components from Intel and NVIDIA, and you can detach the case at any point to install new upgrades. Naturally, this being a Razer product, you’ll find plenty of RGB lighting, all of which you can control through the company’s Chroma software. But arguably the most eye-catching aspect of Project Sophia is the 65-inch OLED display Razer has built into the station. The company says it will also offer a model with a 77-inch display – but we’ll note here Project Sophia may never make it to market.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Looking at the rest of the concept, Razer appears to have paid less attention to ergonomics. Judging from the renders the company shared, you can’t adjust the height of Project Sophia to make it a standing desk or to better accommodate the position of a chair. And speaking of chairs, the company also unveiled a “Pro HyperSense” version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-enki-gaming-chair-hands-head-butt-on-180019360.html">$399 Enki</a> gaming chair. Razer partnered with <a href="https://www.d-box.com/en">D-Box</a> to add haptics to the chair. It will support 2,200 games, movies and TV series, including releases from publishers like Ubisoft and Microsoft.

Today the company has unveiled a tire with 70 percent sustainable material content, which shows the progress it has made towards achieving its ultimate goal. The tire features 13 ingredients across nine different tire components, including three different carbon blacks that are traditionally made by burning petroleum products.</p><p>Carbon black is typically used as a filler to reinforce tires, as well as other rubber products, and to lengthen their lifespan. Instead of using carbon black produced using petroleum, Goodyear used ones that were made using methane, carbon dioxide and plant-based oil. The company says the methods of production its suppliers used to create the sustainable carbon blacks generated less carbon emissions than traditional processes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Goodyear has also been using <a href="https://corporate.goodyear.com/us/en/responsibility/sustainable-sourcing/sustainable-materials.html">soybean oil</a> for certain tire lines instead of petroleum oil, and this one is no different. Soybean oil allows tires to remain pliable in changing temperatures with added traction benefits. The company had been aiming to use 100 percent soybean oil in four of its tire lines in 2020, but it fell short due to production issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Goodyear&#39;s new tire uses a variety of silica, which improves tire grip and help lower fuel consumption, made from rice husk ash, as well. Rice husk ash is a by-product of rice milling, and it&#39;s pretty abundant in rice producing countries. Researchers have ben looking into its use as an alternative for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214509516300924#!">cement</a> and and as a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21870764.2018.1539210">source of silica</a>, and according to Goodwill, it was able to produce high-quality silica from the waste material. In addition, the company broke down polyester materials recycled from plastic bottles and other plastic wastes into their base chemicals. They were then turned into technical grade polyester used for tire cords that maintain the shape of the tire.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Helsel, chief technology officer at Goodyear, said the 70 percent sustainable tire &quot;is an exciting achievement that demonstrates [the company&#39;s] commitment to increasing the use of sustainable materials.&quot; That said, it was manufactured as a demo product, and the company has yet to reveal whether it will be released to the public.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/goodyear-prototype-tire-70-percent-sustainable-materials-170024650.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04e4c213-5e99-43b3-b007-800d654e706c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641387646</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:00:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588dc0a0-6e1b-11ec-84ff-6d09059a7c65" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588dc0a0-6e1b-11ec-84ff-6d09059a7c65" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' ZenBook 14 OLED models get a big redesign and the latest chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Intel and AMD announcing new processors this week, many PC manufacturers are also sharing details on their latest laptops. One of those is ASUS, which on Wednesday unveiled its 2022 ZenBook 14 lineup. At first glance, the most notable difference about the new &quot;ZenBook 14 OLED&quot; is that it features an updated design that&#39;s more square and less obtrusively branded.&nbsp;</p><p>ASUS will offer separate versions of the ZenBook 14 OLED with the latest CPUs from Intel and AMD. You’ll need to go for a 12th-gen Core H processor if you want DDR5 RAM and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity. Ryzen models will ship with DDR4X memory instead. Either way, you can configure the ZenBook 14 OLED with up to 16GB of RAM, though you’ll get faster clock speeds from the DDR5 modules. In addition to up to 1TB of PCIe storage, there’s an extra M.2 slot available if you decide you need more space. Powering everything is a 75Whr cell, and the entire laptop weighs less than three pounds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ZenBook 14 OLED comes with plenty of ports for an ultraportable, including two USB-C connections, a single USB-A port, HDMI 2.0, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. It also comes with WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you get an Intel CPU, the two USB-C ports will offer Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, allowing for data transfer speeds of 40Gbps.</p><p>However, the highlight of the ZenBook 14 OLED is without question its display. On paper, it’s impressive. It’s a 14-inch OLED panel with 2,880 x 1,800 resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio and 550-nit peak brightness. Add to that 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage, DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, a 90Hz refresh rate and claimed 0.2 millisecond response time, and you have a display that should be equally great for productivity, gaming and video streaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/81349540-68e1-11ec-bfeb-5896580971f7" alt="ZenBook 14 OLED Space Edition" data-uuid="098fa6b1-d309-382e-ab4b-681db561c483"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>ASUS will also sell a “Space Edition” of the ZenBook 14 OLED. It has many of the same features as the standard 14-inch model, but you can configure it with up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM. However, your only option on the CPU front is an Intel processor. Notably, it also comes with a smaller 63 Whr battery. The computer&#39;s exterior, which includes a 3.5-inch OLED display, was inspired by the MIR space station. Morse code across the outside of the laptop says Ad Astra Per Aspera. Roughly translated from Latin, that’s “through the hardships to the stars.”</p><p>There’s no word yet on pricing for either the ZenBook 14 OLED or ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition, but ASUS promised to share more information when the laptops go on sale closer to the second half of 2022.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-annoucement-164536850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6587670e-1d70-4299-a95e-63e2ee7091dc</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:45:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221914</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:58:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9c232f30-68df-11ec-87b7-c90ec0a156c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9c232f30-68df-11ec-87b7-c90ec0a156c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASUS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS made a wild 17-inch foldable OLED tablet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/asus/">ASUS</a> has a lot more to show off at CES than traditional laptops. The ZenBook 17 Fold is a full-screen foldable OLED tablet, which marks an evolution from the dual-screen Project Precog concept the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-05-asus-project-precog-concept.html">showcased</a> in 2018.</p><p>The device comes with a Bluetooth keyboard with touchpad. When the screen is partially folded and the keyboard is positioned on the bottom half, it can effectively be used as a 12.5-inch laptop with a Full HD resolution. For more real estate, you can place the keyboard on the desk and stand the tablet up.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a4abf010-68df-11ec-bed6-cc65a2b96fdb" alt="ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED" data-uuid="574a1817-eff9-361d-828d-584dcaa0ab1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>When it&#39;s fully open, the 17.3-inch display has a 4:3 aspect ratio. It has a QHD resolution of 2560 x 1920, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a 100% DCI-P3 color gamut, 0.2 ms response time and 90 Hz refresh rate. The Pantone-validated touchscreen meets VESA&#39;s DisplayHDR 500 True Black standard and it supports Dolby Vision.</p><p>The ZenBook 17 Fold has a 75Wh capacity battery, WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, a Dolby Atmos quad-speaker system and 1 TB of NVMe M.2 SSD storage. You can have up to 16 GB of LPDDR5 memory as well as &quot;the latest Intel CPU&quot; with integrated graphics. Ports are limited to a sole Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port and a 3.5mm combo audio jack.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a8de9d40-68df-11ec-bfe7-da53db7dd146" alt="ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED" data-uuid="b4917c54-fb7b-3a63-be23-2b6f133f0839"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>It&#39;s hardly the first time we&#39;ve seen a manufacturer attempt a foldable tablet PC. Lenovo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-hands-on-specs-price-availability-durability-windows.html">revealed</a> the ThinkPad X1 Fold at CES 2020, though we felt it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-foldable-pc-review-specs-price-181519620.html">wasn&#39;t up to scratch</a>. Foldable phones, of course, have become more commonplace over the last couple of years too.</p><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t disclosed pricing though it&#39;s aiming to release ZenBook 17 Fold around the time of Computex in May. The device and keyboard weigh over four pounds combined, which could make it a hard sell for some folks. Whether ASUS can overcome that issue, as well as supply chain difficulties and problems other manufacturers have had with foldable devices, remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-tablet-foldable-164510240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e7a4ec0a-1ee2-41cc-abb3-0a082af9dc06</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:45:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641407371</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T18:29:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a1aa21c0-68df-11ec-a6eb-9c36cf70adf6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a1aa21c0-68df-11ec-a6eb-9c36cf70adf6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASUS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Owlet's infant monitoring sock is back on sale in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After it was pulled from sale in the US last fall over a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/owlet-fda-warning-211549000.html">warning from the Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA), Owlet’s infant monitoring sock is once again available to purchase. <a href="https://dream.owletcare.com/">Announced late last year</a> and now known as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dream Sock" href="https://fave.co/3eVxTPA">Dream Sock</a>, you can buy the Bluetooth-enabled wearable either as a standalone product for $299 or as part of the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dream Duo bundle" href="https://fave.co/3t0jNEw">Dream Duo bundle</a> for $399.

It relays the data the wearable and camera collect to the Owlet Dream App. Owlet is marketing the Dream Sock as a sleep aid tool.

Owlet doesn’t mention that functionality at all when it comes to the Dream Sock. That was one of the features that separated the company’s products from similar devices offered by competitors like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nanit-pro-smart-sheets-2021-140038210.html">Nanit</a> and a major reason for why the device was popular in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>There aren’t many other products that monitor a baby’s heart rate and pulse ox in the way the Smart Sock 3 does, but it appears that functionality is what attracted the attention of the FDA and prompted the agency to contact Owlet about its marketing of the Smart Sock 3. We’ve reached out to Owlet to find out if it’s working with the FDA to bring that feature back. In the meantime, you buy the Dream Sock through <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet&#x002019;s website" href="https://fave.co/3eVxTPA">Owlet’s website</a>.

This year, in addition to launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-2022-blade-lineup-ces-170053808.html">new laptops</a>, it’s also teamed up with smartwatch maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Fossil" href="https://fave.co/3kFxcfp">Fossil</a> to launch a special edition wearable. The two companies are announcing the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch at CES 2022 and it’s basically what you think: A themed version of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">existing Wear OS device</a> with straps and faces that reflect the gaming company’s identity.</p><p>But the Razer edition of the Gen 6 has some small differences. It only comes in the 44mm size (while the original is also available in 42mm) and also features some unique interface elements. I’ve had a sample to play with for awhile, and frankly, this feels like most Fossil smartwatches, just with an aesthetic nod to Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fossil Gen 6 was the first to feature Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Snapdragon Wear 4100+</a> chip, and like the original series, the Razer edition will be updated to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">new Wear OS 3</a> later this year. So far, the existing software on the watch felt familiar and performed quickly. I swiped through cards and changed watch faces with no delay, though that’s par for the course for Wear OS watches these days. The three custom watch faces for the Razer-branded wearable were what I expected — that is, they had matching color schemes and displayed the time in &quot;fun&quot; fonts. The Wellness face shows your daily stats, but doesn’t look very Razer-esque.</p><p>There’s not much else different about the device, and most other elements like battery life and system performance require me spending much more time with it to test.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/54996550-6db5-11ec-ae3a-84efc5dfd407" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist and the exclusive Wellness watch face. " data-uuid="e489acd5-c310-35aa-a176-36b87a551ae1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I <em>can</em> say now is that as a person with smaller wrists, the Razer watch is a bit too big for me. Are most Razer fans people more big-boned, or do they prefer a chunky aesthetic? I don’t know, but it sure seems like that assumption is being made.</p><p>One thing I do believe Razer’s loyalists love is the company’s distinct acid green color that permeates their products. The special edition Gen 6 comes in a black finish with a black 22mm band with no pops of green on the case itself. But it does come with a bright green strap that you can swap out. Both silicone bands were pliable and comfortable, though, again, I’d prefer a narrower style.</p><p>The larger size does allow for a roomier screen (though the 42mm Gen 6 has the same display dimensions), and I enjoyed how easy it was to read app titles and notifications.</p><p>Razer and Fossil are only selling 1,337 units of this special edition device, because Leet, get it? Anyway, you can get one for $329. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 6 costs between $299 and $319. With its higher price and limited quantity, the Razer watch is clearly meant to be a collectible for the most loyal of the company’s fans.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/776be2b0-6db5-11ec-b37e-3e69af314d21" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist, showing a list of apps including one called " data-uuid="6e2dedc3-6ab0-3feb-82b2-d427374d62c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don’t manage to get one of the Razer watches or are intrigued by Fossil’s other brands, you could also consider the new Skagen Gen 6. The Skagen Falster is my favorite of Fossil’s smartwatches, and the company is launching an updated version that offers its latest suite of features like the Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, faster battery charging and upgraded sensors. It’ll be available in six styles and cost $295.</p><p>Fossil also told Engadget that the Gen 6 series will be getting Alexa support early this year, so those who use Amazon’s assistant for smart home device control can do that from their wrists.</p><p>The Razer x Fossil watch represents an intriguing expansion of Fossil’s lineup, though we might see the company team up with other brands in future. Fossil told me it’s open to the idea, so who knows? Maybe one day we’ll see collabs with the likes of Tesla, McDonalds or, oh God, White Castle.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-x-fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-hands-on-160052253.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96562190-44ea-4765-89e2-1b11467c1d85</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641399449</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:17:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with acid green straps on a wrist.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
