The search giant has <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/further-measures-help-fight-financial-fraud-uk/">announced</a> that starting in the fall it will only run ads for financial products and services from sources that have been cleared by the UK&#39;s financial watchdog.&nbsp;</p><p>Google said it will update its policy from August 30th and begin enforcing the rules a week later on September 6th. At that point, advertisers will have to demonstrate that they are authorized by the UK Financial Conduct Authority or qualify for its limited exemptions. According to Google, the requirement covers financial products and services that go beyond the regulator&#39;s ambit.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decision didn&#39;t happen overnight, however. Google has been on the end of mounting criticism from regulators, law enforcement and consumer groups over its perceived lack of action against scrupulous ads. According to trade body <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/criminals-exploit-covid-19-pandemic-rise-scams-targeting-victims-online">UK Finance</a>, investment scam cases on search engines saw a 32 percent increase last year. These typically involve criminals duping victims into moving their money to a fictitious fund (such as a pension pot) or to pay for a fake investment. Losses incurred from the fake ads totaled over £135 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCA threatened to take legal action against Google and social media companies after it issued 1,200 warnings about fraudulent ads on their platforms, double the amount from 2019. The regulator told a parliamentary committee that it was able to start taking action in the wake of Brexit. In the past, the FCA had been bound by EU rules on financial ads that did not apply to online platforms.</p><p>Others blamed Google&#39;s system for the failings. UK consumer group <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2021/04/two-in-five-victims-of-online-scam-adverts-dont-report-to-host-platforms/"><em>Which?</em></a> found that 51 percent of the 1,870 search engine users it surveyed didn&#39;t know how to report suspicious ads in search listings. The perceived inertia from Google led some lawmakers to claim that it was content to continue profiting from the bogus ads. MPs told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/uk-regulator-warns-google-about-accepting-scam-adverts"><em>The Guardian</em></a> that the company was benefiting from online scammers who paid to host ads on its platforms. While the FCA had also paid Google more than £600,000 ($830,000) in 2020 and 2021 to run ‘anti-scam’ ads.</p><p>For its part, Google claims it has improved its ad screening rules using a mix of machine learning and human review. The tech giant removed <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ads-safety-report-2020/">3.1 billion</a> adverts that violated its policies in 2020 according to its ad transparency report. It also began verifying advertisers in January by requiring them to submit legal identification, business incorporation documents and proof of the country in which they operate. Back in 2018, Google followed in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-30-facebook-bans-ads-promoting-cryptocurrencies.html">Facebook&#39;s</a> footsteps by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-google-ban-cryptocurrency-ads-june.html">banning cryptocurrency ads</a>.</p><p>“This new update builds on significant work in partnership with the FCA over the last 18 months to help tackle this issue,” Ronan Harris, vice president and MD, Google UK and Ireland, said in a blog post. “Today’s announcement reflects significant progress in delivering a safer experience for users, publishers and advertisers. While we understand that this policy update will impact a range of advertisers in the financial services space, our utmost priority is to keep users safe on our platforms — particularly in an area so disproportionately targeted by fraudsters.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-financial-ads-uk-regulator-115001895.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9bcdd36-281f-4898-8941-182eb6720298</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:50:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625053856</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T11:51:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, UNITED STATES - 2021/04/27: The Google logo seen at the entrance to Google Cloud campus in Seattle.

A <em>Silent Hills</em> sequel with Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro and Norman Reedus was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-27-silent-hills-hideo-kojima-del-toro-canceled.html">canceled</a> back in 2015 — despite the appearance of an impressive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-13-kojima-discusses-collaboration-with-del-toro-for-silent-hills.html">playable teaser</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the Konami and Bloober Team partnership is a promising development. <em>The Medium</em> generally met with good reviews, though our own Jessica Condit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/medium-xbox-series-s-review-160039546.html">found it</a> a bit &quot;medium,&quot; as it were. The game&#39;s &quot;dual reality&quot; switching was also well done, so if the two companies combine their horror chops and technology, it could result in some compelling IP.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/konami-strategic-partnership-the-medium-developer-bloober-101519819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7f88db1-b888-4961-a718-47d1ffacf43f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625048599</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T10:23:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bloober]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirCar prototype completes its first inter-city flight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term flying car is a bit of a misnomer. In order to meet regulatory guidelines, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kitty-hawk-flyer-heaviside-045616682.html&#92;">many</a> of the <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/toyotabacked-sky-drive-conducts-a-public-flight-test-of-a-flying-car-073058482.html">vehicles</a> currently in development are more like manned drones or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airspeeder-electric-flying-race-car-test-flight-175132594.html">vertical take-off and landing</a> aircraft (VTOL). But, a prototype that just achieved a major milestone actually fits the flying car description.&nbsp;</p><p>A Slovakian company known as Klein Vision recently completed its inaugural inter-city flight between the Nitra and Bratislava airports. At the end of the 35-minute journey, the vehicle&#39;s inventor, professor Stefan Klein, clicked a button to tuck in its wings and drove the car home straight from the tarmac.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e5d52efbab984777b2befb5081f644ff"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2tDOYkFCYo?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company has been working on its hybrid aircraft for more than 30 years. With 142 successful landings and over 40 hours of test flights under its belt, Klein is convinced that his third prototype is ready to leap past the concept stage. As part of its latest breakthrough, the two-seater AirCar reached a cruising speed of 170km/h, slightly below the max 190km/h. Klein says the car has flown at 8200 ft and achieved steep 45 degree turns as part of its maneuverability testing. Unlike VTOL vehicles, the AirCar requires a runway for takeoff and landing.</p><p>The current prototype is equipped with a 160HP BMW engine with a fixed-propeller and a ballistic parachute. Klein has even bigger plans for its follow-up. He claims the 300HP pre-production model will receive the CS-23 aircraft certification for normal, utility, aerobatic and commuter aeroplanes from European aviation regulators, along with an M1 road permit.</p><p>In reality, getting there could still prove a challenge. The company will have to tread a fine line between a light aircraft and a more substantial vehicle with health and safety precautions built-in. However, there <em>are</em> signs that regulators are coming round to the idea of flying cars. In the US, the Federal Aviation Authority recently granted <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/story/aircraft/terrafugia-transition-faa-slsa-certification/">Terrafugia&#39;s</a> roadable airplane a special certificate in the light sport category (S-LSA), making it legal for flight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aircar-first-inter-city-flight-092852060.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54afa51c-7340-4979-86da-1f7603136c85</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:28:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625045414</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T09:30:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klein Visions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max expands beyond the US to 39 new territories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-latin-america-caribbean-release-date-155038331.html">earlier this year</a>, HBO Max is finally moving outside the US, <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/hbo-max-rolls-out-39-territories-latin-america-and-caribbean-starting-today">expanding</a> to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. &quot;With today’s launch, we are introducing our global platform and providing a brand new user experience to millions of fans across Latin America and the Caribbean,&quot; said HBO Max International head Johannes Larcher in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike HBO Max in the US, subscribers in those regions won&#39;t have the option of an ad-supported plan.

An external investigation conducted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> and <a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/">Derek Abdine</a> (CTO at security firm Censys) has revealed, however, that the bad actors exploited another undocumented vulnerability in a file aptly named system_factory_restore.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, users would have to type in their passwords to be able to perform factory resets on their devices. Indeed, the script in the file contains lines to password protect the reset command. However, someone in  Western Digital &quot;commented out&quot; or, in non-technical parlance, canceled out the command by adding the double / character at the beginning of each line. HD Moore, a security expert, explained to <em>Ars</em> that this doesn&#39;t make things look good for the company. &quot;It’s like they intentionally enabled the bypass,&quot; Moore said, since the attackers would have to know the format of the script that triggers the reset to exploit the vulnerability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devices that were hacked using the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability were infected with malware, and in at least one case, it was malware that makes a device part of a botnet. Since turning My Book Live storage devices into botnets and then wiping them clean makes no sense, Abdine&#39;s theory is that one hacker exploited the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability. After that, a second (possibly rival) hacker exploited the previously unknown reset vulnerability to gain control of the devices, which were then made part of a botnet, or to undo the first one&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, this event just goes to show that the My Book Live storage devices aren&#39;t as secure as anybody would like at this point. Those who still own it should heed Western Digital&#39;s advice and disconnect it from the internet as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-book-live-factory-reset-two-vulnerabilities-044122712.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3414384c-1900-4e70-9b4e-a62a43870594</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 04:41:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625028070</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T04:41:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[playb via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of Unrecognizable man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Little Tikes made a Peloton-style stationary bike for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Young kids who see their folks on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-corporate-wellness-134436951.html">Peloton</a> bike and want to join in on workouts will soon have another way to do that. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/little-tikes-smartwatch-kids-tobi-robot-173711237.html">Little Tikes</a> has created a smart stationary bike for children aged three to seven.

The centered and icon-filled taskbar still looks distinctly Mac-like; the rounded window corners give off a slightly more polished vibe; and the redesigned Start menu is sure to be controversial. It features pinned app shortcuts up top, recommended files at the bottom, and a link in the top right to see the entire unfiltered Start Menu.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Start menu is certainly different, but after testing out the leaked build for two weeks, I&#39;ve grown to prefer the changes. I&#39;ve never met anyone who used the Live Tiles in Windows 10&#39;s Start menu, and those were just a distilled remnant from Windows 8&#39;s horrific full-screen Start page. It&#39;s nice to be rid of that legacy, once and for all.</p><p>As I dug further into the preview build, I noticed small tweaks throughout that just felt, well, <em>nice. </em>Instead of combining notifications and system shortcuts into a single right-hand pane, they&#39;re now broken up across two screens. Hitting the clock in the Windows 11 taskbar brings up all of your notifications, along with a full calendar. The system shortcuts, meanwhile, are combined into a single screen that pop up when you press the Wi-Fi, sound or battery icons.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc53b0-d919-11eb-bfff-765f26f85a03" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="68ce3b55-2876-3947-afd7-df7c39d9458b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>From there, you can join other wireless networks, and turn Bluetooth on and off, along with airplane, battery saver or Focus assist modes. Sliders along the bottom also let you manage your volume and screen brightness. This isn&#39;t that different from Windows 10, but the overall look is a lot cleaner and easier to read. (Maybe I&#39;m just sick of hitting the &quot;More options&quot; to expand Windows 10&#39;s shortcut settings.)</p><p>Microsoft is also clearly pushing a taskbar UI that <em>only</em> features icons in Windows 11. It&#39;s something the company started doing with Windows 7, but up until Windows 10 you always had the option to turn on labels for taskbar icons (at least, until they started piling up too much). While it tended to make Windows look a bit messy, I always liked being able to see what a window contained before I actually clicked on it. Windows 11 no longer has label options of any kind, and there&#39;s no indication that Microsoft wants to bring them back. They just don&#39;t fit into the neat aesthetic the company is aiming for now.</p><p>At first I figured losing labels would be a pain, but I&#39;ve grown used to living with an icon-filled taskbar over the last few weeks. And I&#39;d gladly lose labels in exchange for better multitasking features, like this new OS&#39;s revamped window snapping. Now you can hover your mouse pointer over any app&#39;s maximize button to see an array of areas to snap it to, like the top left or bottom right of your screen. It&#39;s much more accurate than dragging a screen to a specific spot and hoping Windows automatically snaps it into place.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0794bffec2d8462e91f4e4f358fa8cc6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc53b1-d919-11eb-bffd-576340725013" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview"></section><p>Whenever you use the quick snap feature, Windows 11 also shows you all of the other apps you&#39;re running in the other portions of your screen. So if you shove Slack to the top right, you can have Edge take over the entire left side and put Spotify in the lower right within a few seconds. It may sound confusing, but in practice it&#39;s a smart way to make sense of all your open windows. Snapping at least two apps together also creates a snap group in the taskbar, allowing you to easily bring up their arrangement in the future.</p><p>And if you want to take things to another level, you can customize several virtual desktops from Windows 11&#39;s task view. You can reach that by hitting the Windows key plus Tab, or by enabling the Task View shortcut in the taskbar. That&#39;s useful for creating entirely different work modes — say, one desktop for managing email and Slack, and another for focusing purely on writing. Having different spaces could help you stay in your productive “flow”, a concept Microsoft has practically made its corporate philosophy now. (Drink every time someone says &quot;flow&quot; at the next Windows event.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0591-d919-11eb-bdcb-00826bce6285" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="f12ee116-0036-3185-8505-65cc170f17ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>One major addition with this Windows 11 preview is the new File Explorer, which wasn&#39;t fully baked in the leaked build. Now, in addition to file and folder icons, there&#39;s also a simplified toolbar at the top of the screen. But while it&#39;s far sleeker than the Windows 10 explorer, which could get seriously cluttered if you had the Office-style Ribbon toolbar open, it&#39;s also a bit confusing. There are the usual cut, copy and paste commands, but it took me a while to figure out one of the other buttons lets you rename files. I suppose it&#39;s still easier to figure out than the Ribbon though, so I&#39;ll call it a win for Microsoft.</p><p>The new Windows 11 settings app is a clearer upgrade. Like before, it&#39;s where you&#39;ll go to tweak just about everything in your PC, but now it&#39;s organized neatly into two panes. Along the left, you can choose the section, like “Bluetooth &amp; devices,” or “Network and internet.” Along the right, you can drill down into specific settings. And if you don&#39;t have a clear sense of what you&#39;re looking for, the search bar at the top left can point you in the right direction (this is also true for every search bar throughout the OS). It seems like a silly thing to get excited about, but the new settings app could make it far easier for less tech-savvy users to adjust their systems. I can&#39;t help but applaud that.</p><section data-eng-breakout="edc3c369b96d44db97e3789d66b36be7" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fca30d0-d919-11eb-bcef-0180a9f9f00f" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview"></section><p>Among other notable additions, there&#39;s also a redesigned Microsoft Store app in Windows 11. It has a navigation bar along its left side, rather than section tabs from before. Again, this seems to be a deliberate step away from Microsoft&#39;s aging Metro design, which was all about top-level tabs. Widgets also make a return in this OS, something we haven&#39;t seen since Windows 7. Now they pop up on the left side of the screen when you hit the Widgets button in the taskbar. At this point, they&#39;re just simple square apps that can show you the weather, your calendar entries, or upcoming esports matches at a glance. There&#39;s room for Microsoft to make them more useful, but it&#39;s unclear how much the company plans to invest in widgets moving forward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcacd10-d919-11eb-9ef7-24f67d916ffa" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="7d8480a3-eaa0-37fb-afe6-99c864c731b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Some of the Windows 11 features I&#39;m most excited to try aren&#39;t yet available in this preview. That includes the ability to run Android apps, built-in Microsoft Teams chat, and AutoHDR for older games. Similarly, I haven&#39;t been able to test some intriguing new features that actually have been included, like the ability to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-191145232.html"> automatically change your refresh rate</a> while inking or scrolling. That&#39;s only possible on high-refresh-rate monitors that you typically find on gaming screens. Unfortunately, then, my Surface Laptop 4 review unit won&#39;t cut it. Still, I can imagine it being useful. Normally, I just leave gaming notebooks at their highest refresh rate, which makes scrolling and any sort of screen movement look buttery smooth. But that&#39;s not the best idea if you&#39;re trying to conserve battery life.</p><p>Even though this is the first Windows 11 Insider preview, it&#39;s easy to understand Microsoft&#39;s vision for its next OS. It&#39;s all about delivering a polished, uncluttered experience to make you more productive. If you&#39;d like to try it out yourself, I&#39;d strongly recommend testing it on a secondary computer. There are still some bugs that require the occasional reboot (and Microsoft is still trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">sort out installation requirements</a>). Sometimes the auto-snap features just disappear, for example, and the old File Explorer Ribbon interface reappears. Microsoft clearly has a lot of work left to do. But at the very least, Windows 11 appears to justify an entirely new version number.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5bedadf-2df9-49ff-9a5e-b9c5d13a204b</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 21:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625001230</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T21:14:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0590-d919-11eb-a7ff-f21957fe4253" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0590-d919-11eb-a7ff-f21957fe4253" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former BioWare GM Casey Hudson starts new game studio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Less than a year after announcing his decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-retirement-220706781.html"><ins>“retire” from BioWare</ins></a>, Casey Hudson has shared details on his latest project.

To take advantage of the promotion, you need an iPhone XS or newer with iOS 14.5 or later installed on your device. Provided you meet those requirements, you can download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t-mobile-network-test-drive/id1521545162"><ins>Network Test Drive</ins></a> app and follow the on-screen instructions to get up to 30 days or 30GB of data for free.</p><p>While testing the network, there’s no need to change your phone number or provide T-Mobile with your billing information. What’s more, if you have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12</a>, you can even try out the carrier’s 5G connectivity.

Mark Zuckerberg announced the new project during a live audio room, saying that the project was a “response to what’s happening in the media ecosystem.”</p><p>Bulletin will host a mix of free and paid content.

The newsletters will be integrated into author’s Facebook pages and readers can find the content in the news section of Facebook’s app. Authors will also have the ability to &quot;complement their writing&quot; with podcasts and audio rooms, Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The initial lineup of writers includes authors like Malcom Gladwell and Adam Grant, and faces from TV like former CNN White House correspondent Jessica Yellin and former ESPN correspondent Erin Andrews. For now, it’s not clear when Facebook will open up Bulletin beyond its initial slate of hand-picked writers.

Sure, the swiveling screen is useful for following you around the room during video calls, but it also felt gimmicky and unnecessary. Plus, it needs a lot of room to move around so you’re losing a significant amount of counter space. That&#39;s why I’m glad the <a href="https://amzn.to/3xnC7Xe">Echo Show 8</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3iM7V3S">5</a> haven’t repeated that design. In fact, Amazon has changed very little between this edition and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-amazon-echo-show-8-lenovo-smart-display-7-review.html">the last</a>, but trust me when I say that’s a good thing.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8f1a98a6-529d-4be8-a15f-a0aaa05f8e07"/><p>It’s the Echo Show 8 that has seen the most changes, but most of those are under the hood: It now has a faster octa-core processor plus a much-improved 13-megapixel wide-angle camera (the previous model only had a 1-megapixel sensor). Plus, the Echo Show 8 can follow you during video calls without the need for a swiveling display. Instead, it uses digital panning and zooming, the same tech you’ll find in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal devices" href="https://amzn.to/3jtRqK6">Facebook’s Portal devices</a> (plus the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 10" href="https://amzn.to/3w2KhDe">Echo Show 10</a>, when it’s not moving around).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This digital pan-and-zoom works well enough that I feel like there’s a cameraperson keeping my face in frame during video calls, tracking me as I move across my living room. This face-tracking feature works on every video calling platform that the Echo Show 8 supports, which includes Skype and Zoom, in addition to Amazon’s own services. (You can make video calls via the Alexa app or from Echo Show devices.) I found the video and audio quality to be generally quite good. That said, the auto-framing can be a touch glitchy; it sometimes takes a few seconds for it to kick in. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal" href="https://amzn.to/3628tek">Facebook’s Portal</a> does a comparatively better job at this sort of automatic tracking, with hardly any lag.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a019ad0-d591-11eb-aef7-e0257fe740bb" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="c2139f89-59f2-33d2-b7d3-c6a5537bfb3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Show 5, on the other hand, only brings minor changes. It now has a 2-megapixel camera, up from one megapixel, which is still pretty meager. And it comes in a light blue color in addition to the usual black or white. Its camera does not have the pan-and-zoom capabilities of the Echo Show 8, probably thanks to its significantly lower resolution. Notably, the Show 5 currently does not support Zoom. (Amazon has said that it’s working with Zoom to roll out support to more devices, so this could change.)</p><p>The rest of this review might seem like deja vu, as everything else here is very similar to previous generations. Both devices have the same minimalist design. The Echo Show 8 has a 1,280 x 800 resolution while the Show 5 settles for 960 x 480. Photos and video look good on both, though I do prefer watching videos on the Show 8 simply because the screen is bigger. Both the Echo Show 8 and 5 also have an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the screen’s brightness and color temperature according to their surroundings.</p><p>On top of both the Echo Show 8 and 5 are volume controls, a microphone mute button, plus a camera shutter for privacy. The Show 8 has a better sound system than its smaller sibling, with two speakers instead of one. It delivers surprisingly powerful bass and impressive volume, easily filling my small office. The audio from the Show 5 isn’t too bad for its size, but it just doesn’t sound as good. I should note that both the new Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 5 lack the 3.5mm headphone jack featured on their respective predecessors, which means you can’t attach them to larger speakers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1d51b3c0-d591-11eb-befb-87d4f83eaae8" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="68b4297a-dbbd-3240-bedf-3ca0d30c9839"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Both the Echo Show 8 and 5 have a sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens up the display to mimic daylight’s arrival. However, the Show 5 is the only one that lets you tap the top to snooze. This is likely because Amazon is marketing the Show 5 as an alarm clock designed to be on your nightstand, while the Show 8 is meant more for the living room or the kitchen.</p><p>Like the new Echo Show 10, the two smart displays have Amazon’s updated home screen, which features multiple cards that let you view several topics at once, such as weather and sports next to each other. It’s contextual to the time of day as well; I saw the latest headlines during the day, for example, while at night I noticed a suggestion for a relaxing songs playlist. I like this mix of rotating screens a lot; it’s one reason why smart displays are a lot more useful than, say, a smart speaker. You can get a glance of information passively, without having to actively ask for it.</p><p>Using the Show 8 on my computer desk is a treat as well; it’s great as a digital photo frame and it displays the current time and weather conditions as well. I also found it useful in the kitchen, since it has access to a large library of recipes from sources like <em>Food Network</em> and <em>Allrecipes</em>; I can say “Alexa, how do I make chicken noodle soup?” to bring up a list of relevant results. All of the recipes have step-by-step cooking directions; some even have accompanying photos and videos for additional guidance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/578bb540-d591-11eb-97d5-2503b1925bba" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5" data-uuid="51bf0d27-5eff-310b-9900-489c4beff4fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Show 5 fits better on my bedside table. Of course, it works just fine in other areas of the home as well, but its smaller size makes it best suited as an alarm clock. That said, I’m not entirely comfortable with having devices with cameras in the bedroom (even if there is a privacy lens cover). One of the reasons I think <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google&#x002019;s Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4NbA">Google’s Nest Hub</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Lenovo&#x002019;s Smart Clock" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Kexbmv">Lenovo’s Smart Clock</a> make for ideal alarm clocks is that they don’t have cameras at all, which helps allay at least some privacy concerns.</p><p>As with other Amazon smart displays, the latest Echo Shows support video streaming from Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu. YouTube isn’t supported natively, though you can still access it via the built-in Silk browser. It’s definitely not as integrated of an experience as you get on Google’s smart displays. Additionally, there’s no support for Disney+, Paramount+ or HBO Max, all of which are available on Google’s smart displays.</p><p>The Echo Show 8 and 5 offer easy access to smart home controls, which you can use to adjust the temperature of your smart thermostat, control Philips Hue lights and more. As you might expect, these Echo Show displays are especially useful if you’re a frequent Amazon shopper. Adding items to your shopping cart is as easy as telling Alexa to do so. Plus, it shows a reminder when a Subscribe &amp; Save order is about to ship, which helps avoid surprise packages.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/718974a0-d591-11eb-adfb-3160cf0ccb0c" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="dbe3e9b2-eee0-3ca3-a0d4-07164d89344e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I didn’t get a chance to test it, but it’s also worth noting that the Echo Show 5 is available in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kids Edition" href="https://amzn.to/3jnlcAc">Kids Edition</a>, which comes with a year’s subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus. It features a child-friendly home screen and a two-year guarantee against damage. Also important: It lets parents control the content and features children have access to.</p><p>The closest competition to both Amazon smart displays is Google’s second-generation <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4NbA">Nest Hub</a>, which has a 7-inch display. It retails for $100 — a little cheaper than the Echo Show 8 ($130) and a little pricier than the Echo Show 5 ($85), but it also offers slightly different features. The Nest Hub is better for those who prefer Google Assistant to Alexa, and it also offers more video streaming options. I also tend to prefer the Google smart display software, as it’s more visually appealing and intuitive than Amazon’s. It doesn’t have a camera so you’ll miss out on video calls and the speaker system isn’t as good.</p><p>Fundamentally, however, it’s not the hardware that will dictate which smart display you buy as much as which tech giant’s ecosystem you want to be a part of. If you already have Nest home devices and you want YouTube integration, you’re much better off with a Nest Hub. But if you’re already an Alexa user, an Echo Show would be a better option.</p><p>As for which Echo Show you should pick, the Echo Show 8 delivers the most value for the money. Compared with the Echo Show 5, it has a bigger display and superior audio, which is more than worth the extra $45. And it has the same auto-framing camera as the much more expensive Echo Show 10 (even if it lacks the rotating display). If, however, you don’t care much about video calls, and prefer one that doubles as an alarm clock, the smaller Echo Show 5 could be the better bet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc6fe934-b3eb-454b-acab-902e3838bdd6</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624988180</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T17:36:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/fc1d5600-d590-11eb-b7cd-3342a5ad8df6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ae6e1930-d590-11eb-bf2f-30b307c6eb37" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8 and 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8 and 5 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Automakers must report crashes involving self-driving and driver-assist systems]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has implemented a new policy that will require car companies to report incidents involving semi- and fully autonomous driving systems within one day of learning of an accident. In an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/nhtsa-orders-crash-reporting-vehicles-equipped-advanced-driver-assistance-systems">order</a>&nbsp;spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/29/nhtsa-safety-reporting-autopilot/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, NHTSA mandates automakers fill out an electronic incident form and submit it to the agency when one of their systems was active either during a crash or immediately before it. They must report an accident anytime there&#39;s a death, an injury that requires hospital treatment, a vehicle that&#39;s towed away, an airbag deployment or when a pedestrian and or cyclist is involved. The order covers Level 2 advanced driver-assistance systems to Level 5 fully autonomous vehicles, meaning it includes the gamut of everything from Tesla cars with Autopilot to Waymo taxis.</p><p>&quot;This action will enable NHTSA to collect information necessary for the agency to play its role in keeping Americans safe on the roadways, even as the technology deployed on the nation&#39;s roads continues to evolve,&quot; the regulator said. NHTSA said it would also require automakers to send in monthly reports detailing all incidents with injuries or property damage involving their automated driving systems. Companies that fail to comply with the order could face fines of up to $22,992 per day, according to <em>The Post</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NHTSA&#39;s order comes some two months after a 2019 Tesla Model S was involved in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fatal-tesla-crash-driverless-200259765.html">high-profile crash</a>&nbsp;where investigators initially said there was no one behind the car&#39;s wheel.

The idea of Lenovo, makers of the <em>ThinkPad</em>, building a gaming machine worthy of comment feels a little weird, and yet the Legion 5 Pro is just that. The Walmart-exclusive model that I’m testing costs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:$1,530" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=buyersguide2021&amp;subId3=Review-LenovoLegion5Pro&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-0-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H-16GB-512GB-NVMe-TLC-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-Windows-10-Home-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645%3F">$1,530</a>, pairing AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H with NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 graphics. Powerful and affordable? That’s almost revolutionary.</p><p>Rounding out that spec list is 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Mercifully, both components are user upgradeable. That piddly drive will barely hold more than a couple Calls worth of Duty before you’re reaching for an external drive. But these are the sort of smart compromises that Lenovo opted for to keep the price down, letting you add more RAM and storage as needed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And then there’s the screen, a 16-inch, 165Hz QHD, X-Rite Pantone-validated IPS display with the new, taller 16:10 aspect ratio. At 500 nits, the panel can hold its own in bright light compared to many of its rivals, and the matte screen reduces the risk of glare. Watching 4K video on this thing is a very pleasant experience and I’ve enjoyed working from this device the past week or so that I’ve been using it. It certainly makes you want to spend hours at a time staring at gigapixel images of, say, Paris, which I definitely didn’t spend a long time doing this week (cough).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/71c29860-d033-11eb-b1ff-2179554a64f8" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="74eb9322-25d4-320c-ab73-f1879138b56f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Lenovo wasn’t looking to pull up any trees with this design, which is little more than a refinement of what went before. It’s not as thin or light as its rivals, and looks better in a dark room lit only by the glow of an RGB keyboard and the odd Nanoleaf panel. But if you’re buying it as a desktop replacement that’ll spend 90 percent of its time plonked on the same desk, it’s fine. Oh, and the aluminum chassis is rock solid, giving you confidence on those occasions when you do need to take it somewhere. That matte gray paint job, while very business forward, hides a multitude of palm sweat-based sins, but will attract every speck of dust in a three-mile zone.</p><p>The Legion 5 Pro’s chunky chassis also means that you’ll find an excellent supply of I/O running around its deck. You get four USB-A (3.2 Gen 1) sockets, two USB-C (3.2 Gen 2) connections, HDMI, Ethernet and a 3.5mm headphone / microphone jack, as well as the proprietary power port. On the right-hand side, you’ll also find a hardware camera mute button, which replaces the dedicated hardware shutter from previous versions.</p><p>Even after several days of use, using Lenovo’s TrueStrike keyboard remains a pleasant but weird experience. The keys have a depth of 1.5mm, but Lenovo uses “soft landing” switches to make each actuation feel a little deeper than that. Every time you hit a key, you’re expecting the hard jerk of a mechanical keyboard, only to find a pillowy end and bounce back up. It’s like filling your shoes with water on a hot day and then stepping into them: It’s very useful, but your brain is telling you that something’s amiss here.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that Lenovo took advantage of the Legion 5’s bigger deck size to include a numerical keypad. The company says that the numpad itself is full size, but to my eyes and fingers, it feels a little squashed compared to a regular external PC keyboard. The RGB backlighting is perhaps appropriately muted, but can be set to four different lighting zones when required. The trackpad, meanwhile, is perfectly functional, and the bigger size is welcome given how tight previous models have been.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cbd7b00-d043-11eb-82f3-505dc835ee91" alt="Bad image from a bad webcam." data-uuid="5a54619a-162e-3caf-bdc0-5c067e723120"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I have less to say about the machine’s 720p camera, which is the very definition of serviceable. Light blooms, everything’s uncomfortably fuzzy and the overall effect is that of most ‘60s TV shows when they’d get the Vaseline-smeared lens for close-ups. If you’re looking to make a living from streaming, or you’re a professional Zoom-call-haver, buy an external device. Poor webcam aside, Lenovo gets props for offering a dedicated camera disconnect button since there wasn’t room in the space-starved lid for its customary shutter.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H 3.2GHz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8GB, 140Watt TDP)</p></td><td><p>6,871</p></td><td><p>4,899</p></td><td><p>1,411 / 7,416</p></td><td><p>3.19 GB/s // 2.54 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, AMD Radeon RX 6800M)</p></td><td><p>6,992</p></td><td><p>5,189</p></td><td><p>1,457 / 7,691</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s // 1.5 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Surface Laptop 4 15 (AMD Ryzen 7 &quot;Surface Edition&#39; 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Radeon Graphics)</p></td><td><p>6,620</p></td><td><p>512</p></td><td><p>1,048 / 6,551</p></td><td><p>1.9 GB/s // 985 MB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 (2021) (Intel Core i7-10870H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 3080)</p></td><td><p>5,639</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247 / 6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s // 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Benchmarks don’t tell the whole story, but the Legion 5 Pro comes in close enough to machines priced a couple hundred bucks more. When playing demanding AAA games like <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, I got between 50 and 60fps with the settings appropriately tweaked. Naturally, you’ll lose a little bit of that when you enable ray tracing, but it can handle hard work relatively well. The Legion 5 Pro has three pre-set performance modes which can be set inside the Vantage utility, or cycled through when you hit Fn+Q. One neat addition is that the power button will change color depending on which mode you’re in: Auto offers a white glow, Quiet a cool blue, and Performance an angry red.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p>Using a machine like this for general productivity work is a bit like taking an F-150 to buy a box of cereal, but it’s more than possible. After all, if all you’re doing is crunching documents, writing term papers, poking at spreadsheets and using Slack, this has more than enough. When transcoding a 28.2GB UHD H.265 video file to 1080p, Handbrake was able to crunch through it at over 40 fps, making it sturdy enough for even halfway professional video editors.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p>The Legion 5 Pro uses a dual-fan system which pushes hot air out of its chassis through a quartet of exhausts. Two vents at the back are complemented by one on each side, and if you’re not blessed with huge amounts of room, beware. Leave your hand, mouse, gamepad or drink next to one of those vents for too long and they will become uncomfortably warm. Playing <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> was kicking out enough heat that I wondered if I could make s’mores.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/aa17d450-d033-11eb-bfee-4bd37a3b4d63" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021) " data-uuid="c9827c05-370d-38bb-8723-688c7de66195"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This problem is exacerbated with the aluminum underside of the chassis which gets too hot to touch. After a couple hours of gaming, I picked up the machine to move it somewhere else and damn: I thought I’d pulled a baking sheet straight out of the oven. It’s not hot enough to burn you, but it’s not something you wanna touch if you value not being in pain.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It’s also impossible to sugarcoat the sheer noise that this machine makes when the fans spin up. This thing is noisy — noisy enough that you’ll need to dial your speakers up to drown it out or grab a pair of headphones to claw back some of that immersion. This is an occupational hazard of gaming laptops, but it’s worth noting that this system is loud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Another tick in the “not ideal” column is battery life, and despite packing an 80WHr battery, it will not last long when removed from an outlet. Our standard battery rundown test loops a video until the computer dies, with the brightness set to 65 percent and all battery-saving tech disabled. It managed to last for four hours and 43 minutes while using the integrated Radeon graphics, which is <em>fine</em> in the gritted-teeth sense of the word. Certainly, while you can handle a few emails or some light browsing while sat on your couch, this is not a device you can take away from a socket for a full working day without fuss.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">One of the reasons that the Legion 5 Pro is compelling despite some of its flaws is its price, which is something. Lenovo has managed to undercut several of its competitors here, and there’s no wonder it’s only intermittently on sale right now. If you want a machine from Alienware with similar specs (the romantically-named <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-ryzen-edition-r5-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r5-laptop/wnm15ryzr5eufvs">M15 Ryzen Edition R5 Gaming Laptop</a>) it’ll cost you $1,900. For that, you’ll get a Ryzen R7 5800H (same as here), RTX 3070 with 8GB RAM (same as here), 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD (same as… you get the idea).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/914108c0-d033-11eb-8fff-4a0a3aae23f3" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="d930fa19-792c-37ec-9958-0f7897b72dbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">If getting RTX 3070 graphics is a dealbreaker, you could opt for the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-15/RZ09-0369BE22-R3U1">Razer Blade 15 Base Model</a> with a 15.6-inch FHD display, 10th-generation Intel Core i7-10750H CPU, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You will, however, have to pay $2,000 for the privilege, which may be a non-starter for some. ASUS also offers the ROG Strix G15 — an all-AMD version of which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-review-amd-radeon-rx-6000m-120031416.html">we reviewed a few weeks back</a> — with an RTX 3070, priced at <a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202102AM190000003/A17602-ASUS-ROG-Strix-G15-%282021%29-Gaming-Laptop%2C-15.6%E2%80%9D-300Hz-IPS-Type-FHD-Display%2C-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070%2C-AMD-Ryzen-R9-5900HX%2C-16GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-PCIe-NVMe-SSD%2C-RGB-Keyboard%2C-Windows-10%2C-G513QR-ES96">$1,800</a>. If you were looking for a machine in that $1,500-or-so bracket, you could get the $1,600 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Book/RZ09-03571EM1-R3U1">Razer Book</a>, with a Core i7-1165G7 processor and Intel Iris Xe graphics. Alternatively, for $1,500 <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/predator-triton-300-se-laptop-pt314-51s-71uu">Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE</a> packs a Core i7-11375H CPU and NVIDIA’s RTX 3060 GPU, which seems like a fairly reasonable deal all things considered.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Despite all of the chaos that has so far made up the current decade, we’re seeing a new dawn of AMD’s high-<em>er</em> end chips winding up in gaming laptops. This Ryzen 7 5800H can beat (select) Intel chips in a number of benchmarks, and you can expect to see it crop up in a number of other machines across this year. And while wealthier buyers may be tempted by a far pricier machine with RTX 3080 graphics, the 3070 here shouldn’t make you feel like a second-class citizen.</p><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There is lots to like about this machine, although the snips made to push the price down are sure to rankle some. The battery life is well below par, the thermals could do with refinement, and the webcam would look retrograde on even a five-year-old machine. But, if you’re going to stick this on a desk, keep it constantly plugged in to power and never do more than the odd Zoom, does any of that matter?&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">321ef4d1-8372-4043-b728-046e55cc8de8</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624994791</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T19:26:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon picks up the rights to star-studded podcast 'SmartLess']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Wondery will air the <em>SmartLess </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/podcast"><ins>podcast</ins></a> one week before episodes hit other audio platforms, starting on August 1st.

To help you overcome those doubts, Google revealed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-google-nest-smart-home-privacy.html">list of precautions</a> back in 2019 when it rebranded its Home products as Nest. Several of the privacy commitments revolved around on-device data storage and the disabling of camera and recording features. Today, Google is updating those pledges with specific references to multi-device setups, account security, vulnerability research and future software releases. It&#39;s also making them easier to find by bundling them together in Nest&#39;s new <a href="https://safety.google/nest/">Safety Center</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the updates, Google says that all Nest devices released since 2019 are validated using third-party, industry-recognized security standards, including those developed by the Internet of Secure Things Alliance. It&#39;s also added a bit about its Nest bug bounty program that compensates security researchers who unearth vulnerabilities in its tech.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the revised precautions now mention how it keeps your Google Account secure with tools like two-step verification. While it promises future safeguards through a pledge to provide at least five years of security updates for Nest devices after launch. Plus, there are explicit references to its verified boot feature that checks a device is running the right software each time it restarts. Finally, Google also directs you to the device activity page that shows all the gadgets your Google Account is signed into.</p><p>Back when Google first made the commitments, it seemed as though the privacy hoopla over smart home tech was at a fever pitch. A damaging <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-11-amazon-alexa-voice-recording-human-review.html"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report had just detailed how Amazon hired contractors to transcribe Alexa recordings. Facebook — which was still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal — had launched its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">Portal</a> display to mixed reviews, including valid questions over its place in the home. While Google had faced its own backlash for putting a mic in its Nest security hub and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-20-google-nest-secure-mic-forgot.html">not telling anyone about it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Amazon&#39;s internet-sharing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sidewalk-echo-default-214620200.html">Sidewalk</a> feature for Echo and Ring devices have kept data-sharing concerns in the spotlight. Therefore, you can&#39;t blame Google for promoting its privacy commitments in this sensitive environment. Especially, If it makes the difference between people choosing to buy its products over its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-privacy-updates-170006062.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b7c4f54-06ed-466c-823d-a7d6dfef1b90</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624972836</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T13:20:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11007e80-d8d9-11eb-a6af-a17d385ca156" width="675" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11007e80-d8d9-11eb-a6af-a17d385ca156" width="675" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nest Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nest Hub]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch BTS get distracted by a dancing Boston Dynamics robot dog]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/boston%20dynamics">Boston Dynamics&#39;</a> robots can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32wDFCM7iSI">boogie</a>.

Your account needs to have either been verified by the company or have passed the 10,000 follower milestone. Only then can you include a swipe-up link in your Stories. But in what could be a dramatic change for Instagram, it’s trying something different. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>it recently started a test that gives a small subset of its users the ability to link to a website using a Stories sticker.</p><p>Whether the platform eventually allows everyone to share links in this way is up in the air. For now, Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, told <em>The Verge </em>the goal is to track the types of links people post, as well as to ensure they don’t use the feature to push spam and misinformation. The company’s hope is to eventually transition to stickers as the primary way people access websites outside of the platform. “That is the sort of future system we would like to get to,” Shah told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whatever direction Instagram ends up going with this latest test, as of recently the company has been experimenting with some significant changes to how its platform works.
