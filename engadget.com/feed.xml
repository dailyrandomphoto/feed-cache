They&#39;ve also become a budget-friendly option this holiday shopping season as we&#39;ve seen the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:second-gen AirPods" href="https://amzn.to/3Ewo4Th">second-gen AirPods</a> go on sale a few times. Now you can pick them up for only $100, which is roughly $60 off their normal price. While they were on sale for $89 last month for a brief period of time, this remains one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Ewo4Th" id="9b0ac9ea2c774ad89561c147e40f05e8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirPods (2nd gen) at Amazon - $100</a><p>You probably know the drill about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">AirPods</a> by now, but we&#39;ll provide a refresher. These are the &quot;classic&quot; style AirPods that made Apple&#39;s earbuds some of the most popular in the wireless audio space. Their kicker is the H1 chipset inside that allows them to quickly pair and switch between Apple devices. Not only do they connect to your iPhone in seconds, but they can also switch to, say, your MacBook while you watch a YouTube video pretty seamlessly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EarPods-like design of these buds will be great for some, but a bit cumbersome for others. That&#39;s one of the improvements Apple made with its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:third-gen earbuds" href="https://amzn.to/3GrWx69">third-gen earbuds</a>, but those come in at $179. The second-gen models have decent sound quality and a good battery life, too — you&#39;ll get around five hours of use before they need more power, and you can get more than 24 hours of total listening time after a few recharges with the included case. Overall, they may not have some of the newer bells and whistles you&#39;ll find on the latest AirPods, but these make a good pair of wireless earbuds for Apple users on a budget.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-second-generation-airpods-are-back-on-sale-for-100-133533441.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f510e1b-76bb-4eb6-8ef5-969cbeca9807</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 13:35:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638884135</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T13:35:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony stops producing its new ZV-E10 camera due to chip shortages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony only just launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html">ZV-E10</a> mirrorless vlogging camera in July, but as of December 3rd, it has suspended orders and ceased production due to the ongoing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chip%20shortage/">chip shortage</a>, Sony Japan <a href="https://www.sony.jp/ichigan/info2/20211203.html">announced</a>. The company added that a resumption of production and sales will depend upon &quot;the status of parts supply,&quot; and that interested buyers should keep an eye on the camera&#39;s <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10l-b">product page</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 was released as a more capable follow-up to the popular, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-review-162822651.html">compact ZV-1</a> vlogging camera, thanks to the option to change lenses.

The latter two are fairly recent models, but the A7 II originally launched in 2014 — so it&#39;s hard to see a particular pattern.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameras aren&#39;t the only Sony products affected by semiconductor shortages. Sony also reportedly reduced PS5 production, something that might put its delivery target of 14.8 million consoles by March 2022 in jeopardy.

However, the plant won&#39;t come online until 2024 at the earliest, so it&#39;ll do nothing to help Sony or anyone else, anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-suspends-orders-for-the-new-zv-e-10-because-of-shortages-132051883.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ac8e72b5-8706-46e6-8aaf-739e8eaf1e60</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 13:20:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638882962</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T13:16:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d2e798c0-5756-11ec-beff-c160986f0d69" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d2e798c0-5756-11ec-beff-c160986f0d69" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony suspends orders for the new ZV-E10 because of chip shortages]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony suspends orders for the new ZV-E10 because of chip shortages]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's smart thermostat falls to $48 in first ever discount]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in November, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">started selling</a> its own smart thermostat for a price that&#39;s less than half what a Google Nest thermostat costs.

It works with Alexa voice control, as you would expect from an Amazon product, but it doesn&#39;t have speakers or a microphone. You&#39;ll have to issue voice commands through a compatible Alexa-enabled device, such as an Echo or the Alexa app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once set up, Alexa can take over for you. It can set the temperature if you want it to and update it throughout the day for maximum savings potential. Through the thermostat&#39;s learning feature called Hunches, Alexa will be able to automatically adjust the temperature based on its observations. For example, it can turn down the heat if it believes that nobody&#39;s home.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon&#39;s smart thermostat also has a simple, modern design that doesn&#39;t make it look cheap despite being a budget option. The $48 device doesn&#39;t come with a C-wire power adapter. If you need the adapter, you can also get the bundle with one for $63 or 25 percent lower than its usual price, though it&#39;s currently not in stock.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

While Tesla has yet to issue a recall, the news organization has seen internal documents distributed to authorized service providers in late November, asking them to replace faulty repeater cameras at no cost to owners. Apparently, the cameras on some Model S, X and 3 vehicles manufactured by the company at its Fremont, California plant have faulty printed circuit boards.&nbsp;</p><p>Those cameras capture the car&#39;s blind spots, and Autopilot wouldn&#39;t work without them. If they&#39;re not working as intended, drivers typically only see a block box on their main display and may get alerts that their Autopilot has limited function. <em>CNBC</em> says Tesla may have to replace cameras for at least several hundred vehicles as a result of the faulty PCBs it used.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Tesla sales manager told the publication that internal service notices are sometimes followed by voluntary recalls, but the automaker has yet to issue a statement. Tesla recalled vehicles several times in the past over various issues.

It&#39;s also promising to double that tally to two million by next year, while delivering two million fully electric EVs by 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>BMW was a pioneer in the pure electric category with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-07-29-bmw-unveils-i3-electric-car-in-the-carbon-fiber-flesh-video.html">i3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-10-bmw-i8-plug-in-hybrid-pricing.html">i8 EVs</a>, but has been slow to ramp up its offerings since then. As such, the majority of its electrified sales have been hybrid, rather than pure EVs. (The term &quot;electrified&quot; generally encompasses both PHEVs, mild hybrids and EVs.) Between January and September of 2021, BMW reportedly sold 59,688 EVs and 171,887 plug-in hybrid vehicles worldwide, according to <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/05/bmws-ev-sales-double-in-2021-but-still-cant-catch-tesla/"><em>CleanTechnica</em></a>.

It also offers <a href="https://www.bmwusa.com/vehicles/plug-in-hybrid-electric.html">four PHEVs</a>, including versions of the 7, X5, 3 and 5 models. Over the next year, BMW will add the fully electric BMW 7 series and X1, plus the high-volume BMW 5 series by 2023.

Now, you&#39;ll need to pay $6.99 per month for ESPN+, or pick it up in the Disney Bundle that includes Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ for $13.99 per month (ESPN+ is only available in the US). That&#39;s a significant sum, but PGA Tour Live currently costs $9.99 per month on NBC Sports Gold, and ESPN+ offers other live sports coverage (soccer, MLB baseball, NHL hockey, MMA, etc.) on top of golf.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/espn-is-the-new-home-for-pga-tour-lives-extended-golf-coverage-094741252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b75045e-27b8-48d3-973d-2e624bc4c6bd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 09:47:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638870463</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T09:47:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Golf]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/384528b0-5741-11ec-bbf3-7acd75beedaa" width="5985" height="3982" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/384528b0-5741-11ec-bbf3-7acd75beedaa" width="5985" height="3982" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Keyur Khamar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OWINGS MILLS, MD - AUGUST 28:  Bryson DeChambeau at the top of his swing as he plays his shot from the 13th hole drop zone after hitting his tee shot in the water during the third round of the BMW Championship, the second event of the FedExCup Playoffs, at Caves Valley Golf Club on August 28, 2021 in Owings Mills, Maryland.

To start with, it&#39;s launching the previously announced &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-take-a-break-205617444.html">Take a Break</a>&quot; feature in the US, UK, Canada and Australia today. Now, when a user has been scrolling Instagram for quite some time, the app will ask them to take a break and to set reminders for the future. Teens, in particular, will get notifications to set those reminders on to make sure they&#39;re aware of the feature. They&#39;ll also see expert-backed tips to help them &quot;reflect and reset.&quot;</p><p>In March, Instagram will be launching tools for parents and guardians that will give them a way to view how much time their kids are spending on the app and to set time limits. Teens will get the option to notify their parents if they report someone, as well, serving as a way to signal the adults in their life that they may need to talk about it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the experimental features Instagram is testing will come in handy for teens and young adults who want to remove their activity on the app from when they were a lot younger. It will allow users to bulk delete the photos and videos they posted, as well as all their likes and comments. The feature will be available to everyone in January.&nbsp;</p><p>Another test feature will expand what Instagram started earlier this year when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-restricts-adult-dms-to-teens-140416475.html">prohibited</a> adults from DMing teens who don&#39;t follow them. Early next year, it will also switch off the ability to tag or mention teens by adults who don&#39;t follow them, or to include their content in Reels Remixes or Guides. Finally, it&#39;s exploring the possibility of limiting the sensitive content teens see even more and is currently building an experience that would nudge users towards another topic if they&#39;ve been scrolling one topic for a while.&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram head Adam Mosseri is set to testify this week as part of a series of hearings about protecting kids online. Instagram and Facebook have come under fire in recent months after whistleblower Frances Haugen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">told Congress</a> about the social networks&#39; effect on teens based on Meta&#39;s own research. Haugen made a lot of disclosures about Facebook&#39;s algorithms and other internal systems, and one of the things she revealed was that &quot;engagement-based ranking on Instagram can lead children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes… to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-launches-take-a-break-features-for-teens-080049775.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">581eaf03-0510-4b11-996e-4c539f3fe800</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 08:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638864869</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T08:14:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/12a07320-572e-11ec-9fff-3363a7aecdf6" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/12a07320-572e-11ec-9fff-3363a7aecdf6" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Jennings via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, CA - SEPTEMBER 14:  Vice President of Product Management at Facebook Adam Mosseri speaks onstage during TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2016 at Pier 48 on September 14, 2016 in San Francisco, California.

On Monday, the automaker said it would build the plant on the Greensboro-Randolph Megasite, a tract of land located in Randolph County in central North Carolina. When the facility is complete sometime in 2025, it will consist of four production lines, each capable of producing batteries for 200,000 vehicles per year. Toyota plans to eventually expand the facility to produce enough power cells to support up to 1.2 million cars annually.</p><p>The plant is part of a broader <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-us-battery-investment-155141624.html">$3.4 billion investment</a> the automaker has earmarked to expand its battery production capabilities in the US. When Toyota first announced the $1.29 billion facility, it said it would create approximately 1,750 jobs. The company notes it picked Greensboro-Randolph Megasite for a handful of reasons. One of the more notable ones is that it’s a location with access to renewable energy. Toyota says it’s “committed” to using 100 percent clean energy to produce batteries at the facility.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scale of the project is an acknowledgment by the automaker that it needs to diversify its electrification strategy. More so than any other automaker, Toyota invested significantly into fuel cell technology. So far, it has little to show for its efforts. Outside of California, you can’t buy its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-mirai-2021-video-130028882.html">Mirai fuel-cell sedan</a>. However, the company’s latest plan is to offer 70 different electric models, including 15 battery electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-greensboro-randolph-megasite-ev-annoucement-202448241.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">550cdfed-93be-4666-87a7-1e02cd4f9d01</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 20:24:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638883805</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T13:30:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a6f12d60-56d1-11ec-bbdf-481103bc4cd6" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a6f12d60-56d1-11ec-bbdf-481103bc4cd6" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota PHEV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota PHEV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DoorDash tests 15-minute grocery deliveries in New York City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/doordash/"><ins>DoorDash</ins></a> is <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"><ins>piloting</ins></a> an ultra-fast grocery delivery service in Manhattan, with the goal of delivering items to customers in less than 15 minutes.

Dubbed <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/"><ins>RLBox</ins></a> and available through today&#39;s Firefox 95 update, it’s a new sandboxing tool the company developed in collaboration with the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas.</p><p>All modern browsers use sandboxing to protect users against malicious code. The problem is that many of the most advanced exploits chain together two vulnerabilities to bypass those protections. With RLBox, Firefox will compile a process into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-07-mozilla-video-games-browser.html">WebAssembly</a> and then convert it into native code. According to Mozilla, this approach presents two significant advantages. It prevents code from jumping between different parts of a program and limits access to specific areas of your system’s memory.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With today’s release, Mozilla will use RLBox to isolate five components of Firefox, including the browser’s Graphite font rendering engine and Ogg multimedia module. If the system works as expected, the company says “even a zero-day vulnerability in any of [the five components] should pose no threat to Firefox.”</p><p>Mozilla is quick to note it won’t be able to use RLBox to protect every component of Firefox. For instance, it’s not suitable for modules that depend on sharing memory with the rest of the program to function. However, the company is hopeful that other developers will use the technology to make their software safer. In the meantime, RLBox is now rolling out to all desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-95-rlbox-190712215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eea547a2-2579-4ffe-b97a-fde0572cabaf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 19:07:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638817636</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T19:07:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/656fe1a0-c316-11eb-bcd9-f4beb9fb4f38" width="1600" height="894" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/656fe1a0-c316-11eb-bcd9-f4beb9fb4f38" width="1600" height="894" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mozilla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Firefox]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Firefox]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube says most disputed copyright claims are resolved in the uploader's favor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/">shedding more light</a> on the tidal wave of copyright claims it receives in its first copyright transparency report.

Until now, the feature has only been available on the Pixel 6.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pixel 3 or newer smartphones, meanwhile, will now be able to adjust how long they hold the power button to activate Google Assistant. This feature makes it possible to avoid activating the Assistant by mistake when you&#39;re just trying to, say, turn off the phone. Another key feature for Pixel 3 (and up) owners is the Bass Slider that allows you to double the bass range available for Pixel Buds A-series earphones, now from -1 to +4.</p><p>Google is expanding car crash detection to Taiwan, Italy and France, letting you automatically send your location and details to emergency responders when a car crash is detected. It&#39;s also added the &quot;Now Playing&quot; feature that lets you detect a song and quickly add it to your favorites. Finally, Google has added new languages, including Japanese, French and German, that can be transcribed in the recorder app. All of these features are now rolling out to Pixel devices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-6-can-now-be-used-to-unlock-bmw-vehicles-180000062.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51410a4c-0596-41f6-bf3f-653247bcc9d6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638789763</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T11:22:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/670ce460-5685-11ec-bd1d-014fea2f6631" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/670ce460-5685-11ec-bd1d-014fea2f6631" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google update delivers time-saving improvements for Pixel devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google update delivers time-saving improvements for Pixel devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Xbox Windows app will make it easier to know if a game will run well on your PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many different ways to build a computer, one of the trickiest aspects of PC gaming is knowing whether a game you’re about to install will play well on your machine. Microsoft is testing a feature that could make that easier. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22819752/xbox-windows-app-performance-check-feature"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, the Xbox app on Windows now includes a label that will tell you if a game will “play great” on your PC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/28e48cb0-56bc-11ec-9ff6-257ded1e2632" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Xbox Windows PC app" data-uuid="2041ccf5-434b-303c-98a2-b6f7441310c7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tom Warren/The Verge</div></figure><p>Since there are some titles where the app says “performance check not available yet,” it doesn’t appear Microsoft is comparing the listed system requirements against the components in your PC. Instead, it would seem the company is building a database where it tests a game against various different machines. If you want to test the labels, you can do so by downloading the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=[]vg[p]22583793[t]w[r]trello.com[d]D&amp;murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-insider-hub/9pldpg46g47z"><ins>Xbox Insider app</ins></a> and opting into the Windows gaming preview.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the system works well, it could solve a common pain point for PC gamers. In recent years, we’ve seen some developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-pc-requirements-173041076.html">share more granular system requirements</a> for their games, telling you not just the minimum and recommended spec but also hardware that will deliver the best experience at Full HD, QHD and 4K respectively. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been anything close to standardization across the industry, and that’s even before you consider the fact some developers list overly optimistic requirements for their games.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-app-pc-label-175256205.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23f87bb8-1b33-4a45-ad2d-5d0aae2624c0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 17:52:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638813179</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T17:53:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/1f5606c0-83cc-11ea-a7d1-b81a19d19a5a" width="5277" height="3576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/1f5606c0-83cc-11ea-a7d1-b81a19d19a5a" width="5277" height="3576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[La Bicicleta Vermella via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boy with headphones playing on his computer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['The Matrix Awakens' is an Unreal Engine 5 demo you can preload today]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On December 9th, Epic Games will release <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/wakeup"><em>The Matrix Awakens</em></a>, an interactive tie-in to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-131249225.html"><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em></a>.

Commercial electric planes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">won&#39;t be feasible</a> until batteries become more powerful and lightweight. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hydrogen/">Hydrogen-powered</a> flight is another possible way forward, and a research group has <a href="https://dft-newsroom.prgloo.com/news/government-backed-liquid-hydrogen-plane-paves-way-for-zero-emission-flight">revealed</a> what such a plane could look like.</p><p>The FlyZero project, which is led by the Aerospace Technology Institute and funded by the UK government, came up with a concept for a liquid hydrogen-powered midsize aircraft. It said the plane would be able to fly 279 passengers non-stop from London to San Francisco, or from London to Auckland, New Zealand with one stop for refueling. The aircraft, which has a 54-meter wingspan with two turbofan engines, would offer the &quot;same speed and comfort as today’s aircraft&quot; but with zero carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ATI says its concept plane would have cryogenic fuel tanks in the rear fuselage, which would store hydrogen at -250 degrees Celsius (-418 degrees Farenheit). Two smaller &quot;cheek&quot; tanks along the forward fuselage would keep the plane balanced as fuel is used.</p><p>We&#39;re years away from commercial hydrogen aircraft becoming a reality, though.

The LED 4K UHD model has hands-free Alexa capabilities similar to Amazon&#39;s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">Omni TVs</a>, so you can issue voice commands from across the room. Toshiba also claims that it&#39;s the first Fire TV with local dimming, which improves the display&#39;s contrast ratio by dimming dark areas of the screen when needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Model M550KU has a bezel-less design, with a 4K screen that has a 120Hz refresh rate. It supports Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and it has a live view-in-view feature that can show feed from compatible smart doorbells or security cameras. To be able to hear and respond to voice commands, Toshiba embedded microphones into the device, allowing you to launch apps, play music and control smart home devices without the need for a remote control.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the Omni lineup was announced, there were <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-own-fire-tv-tiktok-netflix-shuffle-1235059585/">reports</a> that Toshiba was designing TVs with a microphone array for far-field Alexa and was planning to release them next year. It&#39;s unclear if this model was one of those, but you don&#39;t have to wait until 2022 to be able to get it. The new model will be available starting early this month in three sizes on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/toshiba-55-class-m550-series-led-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv/6479694.p?skuId=6479694">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Toshiba-55-inch-Class-Smart/dp/B09K8ZY7KF/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=toshiba+fire+tv&amp;qid=1638483496&amp;sr=8-4">Amazon</a>.

If you missed them during the Black Friday sale rush, you have another opportunity to grab them on a good deal. Amazon has the earbuds for $170, or roughly $80 off their normal price. That&#39;s not the lowest we&#39;ve seen them — they hit $159 on Black Friday proper — but it is one of the better prices of the season. Also, you can still get these before the holidays because, at the time of publishing this, Amazon estimates delivery by December 18.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rGnqPC" id="fd627207d0fe4e228a5df1b51922388f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirPods Pro at Amazon - $170</a><p>These buds earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">score of 87</a> from us for their better fitting design, good audio quality and strong active noise cancellation. Their interchangeable ear tips give you more control over how they fit in your ears and they&#39;re IPX4-rated, so they&#39;ll survive even your sweatiest workouts. You&#39;ll be able to block out a significant amount of environmental noise with ANC enabled, and Transparency mode lets you easily jump in an out of conversations that you need to hear.</p><p>But the advantage that the Pros have over other earbuds, even some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">our favorites</a> like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#39;s WF-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/3EoAlsR">Sony&#39;s WF-1000XM4</a>, is the H1 chip inside that allow them to pair with iOS devices easily as well as switch between them depending on what you&#39;re doing. That means you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music on your MacBook without any hiccups. The chip also enables features like hands-free Siri access, too.</p><p>While the earbuds themselves haven&#39;t really changed since launch, the &quot;new&quot; AirPods Pro have a MagSafe case. They were capable of wireless charging before, but now you can use them with any magnetic chargers you may have that also work with the latest iPhones. Overall, the Pros remain a solid choice if you or someone you love needs a convenient pair of all-purpose wireless earbuds that have extra perks for iPhone users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airpods-pro-drop-back-down-to-170-on-amazon-132948291.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d0bb3b0-6490-4cb7-afad-01748f84b33c</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 13:29:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638820043</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T19:47:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
