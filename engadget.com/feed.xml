According to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"><em>9to5Google&#39;s</em></a> deep dive into the current Google Camera APK, the phone is codenamed Pipit. While there aren&#39;t many concrete details about what the foldable looks like or how it functions, the APK offered some insights into the Pipit&#39;s camera setup.</p><p>Seemingly, the main camera will have the 12.2MP sensor Google used in its devices between the Pixel 3 and Pixel 5. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html"><ins>new Pixel 6 lineup</ins></a>, meanwhile, uses a 50MP GN1 camera.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pipit (or Pixel Fold, or whatever it will actually be called) is said to use the same 12MP IMX386 ultrawide sensor as the current Pixels, as well as two front-facing 8MP IMX355 sensors. There&#39;s likely to be one of those on each side of the body so folks can take selfies whether the device is folded or unfolded.</p><p>It makes sense that the main camera might not be as powerful as the one in the Pixel 6 lineup. Those phones have<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html"><ins> a protruding bar on the rear</ins></a> to give the camera sensors enough room. Size is a bigger concern on a foldable than a slab-style smartphone, given it&#39;s twice as thick when its closed. So, camera sensors with a slimmer profile might be preferable for Google in this case.</p><p>Samsung has also used lesser cameras in its foldables than in the flagship S Series devices. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</ins></a>, for instance, doesn&#39;t have as powerful cameras as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html"><ins>Galaxy S21 lineup</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, the APK includes the term “isPixel2022Foldable.&quot; That&#39;s a decent indication that Google plans to release a foldable device next year, given how Google has used similar terminology to refer to previous Pixel models.</p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, Google recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html"><ins>a version of Android designed for tablets and foldables</ins></a>. The company plans to release the first public version of Android 12L next year, &quot;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldables.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-foldable-pixel-2022-report-android-12l-141906863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">518ef5f5-d0ab-453a-9e7a-2b7627243d66</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 14:19:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636121948</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T14:19:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbb17ec0-351d-11ec-bfd9-5d96d5d5bd1b" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbb17ec0-351d-11ec-bfd9-5d96d5d5bd1b" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Side view of the Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro standing face to face, focusing on their camera bars.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gifts for the coffee nerd in your life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This holiday, why not encourage friends and family to expand their coffee-consuming horizons. We’ve compiled a list of the best gifts for coffee nerds you can buy this year, with options for brewing, drinking and more. And if that special someone isn’t into java, we’ve got gifts that will work just fine for tea drinkers too.</p><h2>Aeropress Go</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d17c6010-2dc1-11ec-b5df-81f607f500b4" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="1f310e36-70d0-35e2-9d1b-44a4c40f30e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>The Aeropress is a fun way to make a single cup of coffee at home with an apparatus that doesn’t take up much space in the cabinet. It’s a versatile brewer that allows you to experiment with different times and strengths as you go. I like to use it to brew a double-strength cup directly over ice whenever I forget to make cold brew. For the coffee nerd on your list that has a regular setup already, the Aeropress makes a great gift. And the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Aeropress Go" href="https://amzn.to/3uZJq7s">Aeropress Go</a> is even more compact. It tucks neatly inside a cup that you can brew directly into and is perfect for camping and travel. <em>— Billy Steele, Senior News Editor</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uZJq7s" id="c59fa5a116c043f99719498065ff922d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Aeropress Go at Amazon - $32</a><h2>Adagio Simplicitea starter set</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d17cae30-2dc1-11ec-93c9-42a7c78fe88b" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="dccc6c99-cc73-3b09-824f-3f0b925b4346"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adagio</div></figure><p>Coffee isn’t everyone’s caffeinated drink of choice, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Adagio&#x002019;s Simplicitea starter set" href="https://fave.co/2WMpMiM">Adagio’s Simplicitea starter set</a> is a thoughtful gift to give the tea lover in your life. It includes a 12-ounce Borosilicate glass teapot with a stainless steel lid and mesh rim, allowing them to brew loose leaf tea and pour all from one vessel. And you can choose the type of tea they like the best — black, green, herbal or a best-sellers mixture — to accompany the new pot. Serious tea aficionados probably already have their preferred brewing tools, but this set is a great option for anyone looking to step back from traditional tea bags and dip their toes into the wide world of loose leaf tea. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2WMpMiM" id="21327eec1e074d35bd0b2f87b6c87e74" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adagio;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Simplicitea starter set at Adagio - $24</a><h2>Baratza Encore</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d17cd540-2dc1-11ec-be73-6b5b1b9a57fe" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="2fe11dd9-b5f8-3676-83b0-ac9f55e431b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Baratza</div></figure><p>While there are more affordable coffee grinders out there, few of them have achieved the workhorse status of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Baratza Encore" href="https://amzn.to/3oLMsv8">Baratza Encore</a>. The conical burr design offers consistently even grinds with 40 size settings for a variety of brewing methods. The hopper holds eight ounces of whole beans and it’s clear so you can see exact supply levels at a glance. It’s simple, easy to use and will help the coffee geek on your list produce some truly outstanding brews. <em>— B.S.</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oLMsv8" id="5ba850b860fa43ff90a6ee463ebd2acd" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Baratza Encore at Amazon - $170</a><h2>Brumate Toddy</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d1842840-2dc1-11ec-8fff-499e4f6b7383" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="1b84297e-95a4-3a9d-b059-7844a61ba894"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve been a big fan of Brumate’s wares since I bought myself a Hopsulator Trio for a beach vacation a few years ago.

However, when the temperatures begin to dip, I tend to reach for hot beverages more often, so <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Brumate&#x002019;s Toddy" href="https://fave.co/3uNZCc7">Brumate’s Toddy</a> insulated mug is a better option. The cup works well to keep drinks hot or cold and the trademark feature is the spill-proof lid. That thing has saved me from massive cleanup more times than I can count. The regular Toddy can hold 16 ounces while the Toddy XL doubles the capacity to 32 ounces. Plus, it’s a gift someone on your list can use year-round. <em>— B.S.</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3uNZCc7" id="99e146fdf9d14407aa53d245c3a7e645" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Brumate;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Toddy at Brumate - $30</a><h2>Cosori Gooseneck Electric Kettle</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d18539b0-2dc1-11ec-8ff8-e241bbf05273" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="d19bfb70-c9e3-382c-a6a4-db711dc93c20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>A good kettle is essential if you want to up your home-brewing game, and it can help make a bunch of other things too like tea, ramen and more. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cosori&#x002019;s Gooseneck Electric Kettle" href="https://amzn.to/3uWinKx">Cosori’s Gooseneck Electric Kettle</a> packs most crucial features into a relatively compact kettle that’s also priced right at $70. Goosenecks can be intimidating but they give you much more control when pouring over a Chemex, and we think Cosori’s, with its matte black finish, also looks pretty nice on most countertops. It has a stainless steel interior and five temperature presets so you can easily get the perfect temperature for things like green tea, black coffee and more. Plus, the “hold temp” option lets you set and forget the water for a bit; you can turn it on before you start your morning routine and come back to perfectly heated water, ready for whatever’s picking you up that morning. <em>— V.P.</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uWinKx" id="48aad7522634482aa11c730fcb554390" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Cosori electric kettle at Amazon - $70</a><h2>Ember Mug 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d18539b1-2dc1-11ec-96ec-89da21cbeae5" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="762514dd-ec27-3278-996f-2901fff4916b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ll be honest: when I first saw the original Ember travel mug, I thought it was a bit ridiculous. Most insulated tumblers are capable of keeping your brew warm long enough for you to drink it.

The rechargeable cup keeps your coffee or tea warmed to a desired temperature that you set in the Ember app. Battery life could be better, but it gets the job done.

It keeps coffee warm and cold brew cold even without the lid on. When closed, it can keep drinks warm for 12 hours and cold for 24 hours. There’s a nice lip around the top that offers an enjoyable sipping experience. Sounds weird, I know, but I’m not being dramatic when I say this mug is a joy to drink out of.

In fact, I have two just to make sure I have enough cold brew on hand during the summer. The real key here is the removable basket.

They’re pricey coffee makers, but they simulate the action of pour-over-style brewing without all of the… well, pouring.

We recommended the $275 Roomba 694 in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> because it did a good job cleaning hard and carpeted floors and has a straightforward mobile app experience that even newbies will learn quickly. Now, you can grab that robo-vac at the best price we&#39;ve seen it — an early Black Friday sale at Amazon has knocked the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3BRAxyC">Roomba 694</a> down to $180, or $94 less than usual.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BRAxyC" id="3df21a2645404ae3afee4475c932841a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $180</a><p>This model just came out earlier this year and it replaces the older Roomba 675. The two vacuums are mostly the same, albeit for the refined design on the Roomba 694. It&#39;s a sleek, all-black robot with three buttons on its top in the center, which allow you to manually control it whenever that&#39;s easier than using the companion mobile app. It uses iRobot&#39;s three-stage cleaning system to suck up dirt on both hard floors and carpet, while navigating around furniture and other obstacles. It also goes a good job sensing problem areas — like pockets of dust or small piles of dirt — and focusing on those until they&#39;re gone. It even has a spot-clean feature that you can activate by pressing one of the on-device buttons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba 694 connects to WiFi and works with iRobot&#39;s mobile app, which lets you turn on the robot, set schedules and more. iRobot&#39;s app is clean and easy to use, so if you&#39;re thinking about gifting this to a less tech-savvy person, they shouldn&#39;t have a problem figuring out how to use their new robo-vac. The Roomba 694 also works with Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can activate it without even opening the app — just ask your preferred voice assistant to get it to start cleaning. This model should run for about 90 minutes when cleaning hard floors before it automatically returns to its base for a recharge. The Roomba 694 was already a great choice for those on a budget who wanted an iRobot device to clean their homes, but now it&#39;s a steal at this early Black Friday price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-of-180-124023035.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">558bb4a6-425d-490c-8da3-62dfe806f184</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:40:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636116025</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T12:40:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Is Meta’s metaverse crazy, or genius?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, Devindra and Engadget’s Jessica Conditt dive into Facebook’s big metaverse moves.

launch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Konami dropped Pro Evolution Soccer in favor of the new free-to-play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html"><em>eFootball franchise</em></a> with the promise of decent gameplay on the cheap. Unfortunately, the launch was nothing short of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/efootball-and-its-weirdass-faces-is-the-worst-reviewed-game-in-steams-history/">woeful</a>, with bad player models, numerous glitches and an uproar over a $40 DLC that couldn&#39;t even be redeemed until a big version 1.0 update originally scheduled for this month.</p><p>Now, Konami is saying that this update is being pushed way back to spring of 2022.  As such, it&#39;s refunding players who pulled the trigger on that DLC and forcing them to reinstall the game. &quot;If you have pre-ordered the Premium Player Pack and wish to continue to play <em>eFootball 2022</em>, you will need to re-download the core game after the pre-order has been cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience,&quot; the company wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bf532040-3e29-11ec-ad6f-95a246ff5b42" style="height:608;width:1080;" alt="Konami is refunding players who bought pricey DLC after disastrous &#39;eFootball&#39; launch" data-uuid="89e36dfd-4fea-3e90-a660-22df96d25a02"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Konami</div></figure><p>To make the game more usable in the near term, Konami released an update (v0.9.1) &quot;to fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform starting today (November 5th),&quot; it wrote. Left unsaid there is the severity of the glitches, which make for some pretty cringe reading. Choice ones include &quot;the referee may be shown as being trapped on the surface of the pitch,&quot; &quot;pitch grass is not shown three-dimensionally,&quot; and &quot;players may get caught up in the goal net when performing a goal celebration close to the goal.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s hard to be optimistic given the issues Konami has had with its football games, but the company did buy itself some more time. We now have to wait until spring 2022 to see if it can do anything to turn <em>eFootball</em> around.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/konami-forced-to-refund-e-football-players-who-bought-dlc-after-disastrous-launch-120555305.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee4672ab-5275-4b7b-ab74-d49f33945ac2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636111873</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T11:31:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed33ff50-3e26-11ec-a1df-a0e17863c362" width="1820" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed33ff50-3e26-11ec-a1df-a0e17863c362" width="1820" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ Konami Digital Entertainment / Konami via Steam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami forced to refund 'eFootball' players who bought expensive DLC after disastrous launch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami forced to refund 'eFootball' players who bought expensive DLC after disastrous launch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The electric motorcycle with speed upgrades via in-app payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zero Motorcycles’ new electric motorbike is taking a thoroughly 2020s approach to upgrades.

The club’s previous leadership is accused of reckless spending on high wages on a number of players that have subsequently underperformed.

MIT&#39;s CSAIL computer science researchers are trying to fix that by teaching robots how to interact with other robots to to further their own goals, according to a <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/event/formalizing-teamwork-human-robot-interaction">new paper</a>. The research could lead to improved human-robot interactions in assisted living facilities, for instance, and even help psychologists better measure social interactions between humans.&nbsp;</p><p>To study these interactions, the researchers created a simulated 2D environment that allowed virtual robots to pursue both social and physical goals. For instance, a physical goal might be to navigate to a tree at a certain point on a grid, while a social goal is guessing what another robot is trying to do and then acting based on that, &quot;like helping another robot water the tree,&quot; according to CSAIL.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The robot is rewarded for actions that get it closer to its goals, with a matching reward for helping and an opposite reward for hindering it. The team created three types of robots: The first has only physical goals, the second has physical and social goals, but assumes all robots only have physical goals. The third one assumes the others all have social and physical goals, so it can take more advanced actions like joining with others to achieve a goal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Even young infants seem to understand social interactions like helping and hindering, but we don’t yet have machines that can perform this reasoning at anything like human-level flexibility.</p></blockquote><p>The team created 98 different scenarios with all three types of robots. Twelve humans watched nearly 200 video clips of the robots interacting, and then had to estimate the physical and social goals. &quot;In most instance, their model agreed with what the humans thought about the social interactions that were occurring in each frame,&quot; the researchers said.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers hope that the results will act as a &quot;benchmark&quot; that allows others to work on similar social interactions. Next, they plan to create more complex environment with 3D agents that allows more types of interactions. The eventual aim is to not just teach robots how to interact better socially, but &quot;dig deeper into the human aspect of this,&quot; said senior author Andrei Barbu. &quot;Can we make an objective test for your ability to recognize social interactions? Maybe there is a way to teach people to recognize these social interactions and improve their abilities.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/researchers-are-working-on-giving-robots-social-skills-105557425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc1ff9a3-6091-4672-bb41-641fd92d1507</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 10:55:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636115298</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T12:28:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b7b4260-3e18-11ec-bde7-02789757ead0" width="900" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b7b4260-3e18-11ec-bde7-02789757ead0" width="900" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Researchers are working on giving robots social skills]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Researchers are working on giving robots social skills]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta is reportedly planning physical stores to showcase its products]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The company formerly known as Facebook has been discussing the possibility of opening retail stores way before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">rebranded</a> itself as Meta, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html?referringSource=articleShare"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Apparently, discussions about opening brick-and-mortar shops started last year, though nothing has been finalized, and the project could still end up being scrapped. If Meta does open physical outlets, however, they will reportedly be more like experience stores introducing people to devices developed by its Reality Labs division rather than outright retail shops.</p><p>Those devices include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest</a> (soon to be Meta Quest) virtual reality headsets and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html">Portal</a> gadgets, which were designed primarily for video calling. The stores could also showcase the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">augmented reality smart glasses</a> called Stories that Facebook developed with Ray-Ban. Based on the documents <em>The Times</em> saw, Meta&#39;s goal is to spark &quot;curiosity&quot; and &quot;closeness&quot; with its stores, as well as provide customers with a welcoming atmosphere where they can have a &quot;judgment free journey&quot; while experimenting with headsets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those same documents show that Meta envisions shops with a modern, minimalist aesthetic and subtle branding placement. The company considered a lot of possible names, such as Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook. It eventually settled on Facebook Store, but that will mostly likely change now that the company has been renamed.</p><p>If Meta does push through with this plan, its first retail/experience store will be located in Burlingame, California, where there&#39;s a Reality Labs office. <em>The Times </em>says the project could eventually span the world, though, with locations in various countries and regions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-physical-stores-reality-labs-products-101802202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ec90835-170f-470f-976b-5b91052046d4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 10:18:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636107498</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T10:18:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/83da8ca0-3e1b-11ec-bbad-2de529329ff6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/83da8ca0-3e1b-11ec-bbad-2de529329ff6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meta Quest 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shure launches its first hook-free wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At least year&#39;s CES, Shure presented its first true wireless earbuds called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-shure-aonic-50-aonic-215-wireless.html">Aonic 215</a> — it even released the model&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shure-aonic-215-gen-2-earbuds-152055062.html">second-gen version</a> this September.

It can capture 4K video at up to 30 fps.&nbsp;</p><p>DJI has confirmed that the Mavic 3 will have up to 46 minutes of autonomy in ideal conditions (40 minutes of hover), as leaks had suggested. That&#39;s up pretty massively from the Mavic 2 Pro or Air 2S, both of which offer 31 minutes of flying time. It can also fly a bit faster too, at 47 MPH compared to 45 MPH. Those capabilities were enabled by a higher-capacity battery, more energy-efficient motors/propellers and a more streamlined shape on the Mavic 3&#39;s arms, body and gimbal. &quot;Wind tunnel testing shows Mavic 3 produces 35 percent less drag than previous generations,&quot; DJI wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d30fab90-3d6a-11ec-bfff-97ac713093d1" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="616a3634-2c08-3f89-b97a-2ffaf2b7e4e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 also offers enhanced flight safety thanks to its updated APAS 5.0 system that uses inputs from six fish-eye vision sensor and two wide-angle sensors to detect and avoid obstacles. Meanwhile, the ActiveTrack 5.0 system has new options for tracking subjects no matter which way they&#39;re moving, and it can even continue to track a subject if it moves out of frame and pick it back up when it reappears. All of that allows &quot;more fluid and diverse drone and camera movement,&quot; DJI said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also comes with an improved RTH (Return to Home) system that works by automatically calculating the shortest, safest and most energy-efficient route to land back at its home point. It can take into account wind speed and power when calculating the path, giving users a bit more flying time before triggering the RTH action.  Another updated feature is O3+ signal loss prevention that allows for a maximum control range of 15 km. Mavic 3 is also DJI&#39;s first drone with a 1080p 60fps transmission speed on the live feed, meaning &quot;the camera view is displayed at a resolution close to what the camera actually records,&quot; DJI notes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff4d5a90-3d6a-11ec-bd19-948f9c2573ba" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="01149e62-4b21-357e-8018-d64f07ca3a61"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Along with the drone, DJI introduced a number of new accessories, including a new DJI RC Pro smart controller, a 65W Portable Charger that&#39;s compatible with notebooks and smartphones and allows for fast charging (around 96 minutes), a wide-angle lens and two sets of ND filters (ND4/8/16/32 and ND64/128/256/512) that allow for shooting in bright sunlight. It also introduced a carrying bag that converts into a backpack that can fit the drone, a laptop and other accessories.&nbsp;</p><p>Engadget received the drone just yesterday, so we haven&#39;t had a chance to fly it yet — stay tuned for a full review. However, I&#39;m impressed so far by the design and small details like the storage cover that protects the camera, gimbals and propeller (below). It&#39;s also clear that DJI has put a lot of thought into the new charging system and batteries that should make operation more practical. Even the carrying bag/backpack is well conceived, with pockets and sleeves for the batteries, ND filters and more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1f0eee70-3d6b-11ec-b2ac-b40dfee8cece" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="54174dc9-aaa0-346f-9477-3fec741d79f2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As you may have noticed, the drawback with the Mavic 3 is the relatively high price. Rather than $1,600 as was rumored, the Mavic 3 starts at $2,200 for the Standard model, which includes the Mavic 3 drone, storage cover, one battery and charger, the RC-N1 remote control &quot;and other essential items.&quot; The $3,000 Mavic 3 Fly More Combo adds two extra batteries (three total), a three-battery charging hub, the ND4/8/16/32 filter set and the fancy bag/backpack.</p><p>Finally, the $5,000 Mavic 3 Cine Premium Combo gives you all that plus the aforementioned 1TB SSD and Apple ProRes 422 HQ recording (arriving in January 2022). It adds a few more accessories to the Fly More Combo as well, including the RC Pro remote, ND64/128/256/512 filters and the DJI 10Gbps data cable. Five grand is obviously lot of money, but the Cine model is aimed more at professional film producers.

Per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-rivian-executive-sues-for-gender-discrimination-ahead-of-ipo-11636054512"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7">Laura Schwab</a>, an executive who was a vice president of sales and marketing at the automaker until last month, filed a gender discrimination complaint with the California Superior Court in Orange County on Thursday. In the lawsuit, Schwab alleges she was fired by Rivian after she complained of a “toxic ‘bro culture’” that saw other executives exclude her from meetings and ignore her advice.</p><p>“The culture at Rivian was actually the worst I’ve experienced in over 20 years in the automotive industry,” Schwab told <em>The Journal</em>. A veteran of the automotive industry, Schwab held executive posts at Aston Martin Lagonda and Jaguar Land Rover before she joined Rivian in November 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the outlet, Schwab tried to push the company to address numerous concerns while she was there. In one instance, she allegedly tried to tell the other executives on Rivian’s leadership team that the company had underpriced its vehicles. In yet another situation, she tried to raise concerns about the quality of the automaker’s manufacturing process. In the former case, the company allegedly initially dismissed her advice only to later follow through on it after a male executive raised the same issue.</p><p>The suit comes ahead of Rivian’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/"><ins>planned IPO next week</ins></a> where the company will seek to raise as much as $9.6 billion in additional investment.

More broadly, the suit comes as several other companies in the tech space face scrutiny over their gender equality practices. Most notably, there’s Activision Blizzard, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sued by California’s fair employment regulator</ins></a> in July for fostering what it described as a sexist “frat boy” workplace culture.

The policy will apply regardless of a customer&#39;s vaccination status, although retail staff will still have to wear masks due to longer interactions and closer contact.

It just might. Porsche is developing a &quot;digital twin&quot; (that is, a virtual copy) that helps predict service requirements based on driving styles. Algorithms can parse a combination of sensor data and &quot;big data&quot; to recommend service based on your driving style. You may need early work on your suspension if you take your car to the track, or the engine if you have a long highway commute.</p><p>The system can even anticipate faults before they happen. That will please mechanics, of course, but it could also keep you safe (and spare you additional repair costs) by scheduling maintenance long before there&#39;s a crisis.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Porsche doesn&#39;t officially launch its first digital twin until 2022, and then only using sensor data. Field testing is already underway however — about half of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> owners have volunteered for a pilot that anonymously monitors the EV&#39;s air suspension for body acceleration. If the car ventures past certain thresholds, the vehicle tells the driver they may need to visit a repair shop.</p><p>The twin system would let automakers ditch fixed maintenance schedules in favor of driver-specific recommendations. Porsche also envisions the algorithms helping even when your car is running flawlessly. You&#39;d have a digital record that could both suggest an accurate selling price for a used car as well as greater transparency for would-be buyers. Car brands could even pitch extended warranties based on the status of your car. So long as companies take privacy into account, though, this could save you more than a little stress (and moments of sheer panic) on the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-digital-twin-predicts-service-202153543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06e3ab42-72a7-4cdf-a928-611209e6f684</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 20:21:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636057792</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:30:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Square makes its Cash App available for teen use]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/square/">Square</a> is now <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/status/1455942956343611399"><ins>allowing all teenagers</ins></a> to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cash%20app/"><ins>Cash App</ins></a>, after restricting it to adults until now.

The news was met with enthusiasm by the scientific community, but it wasn’t clear at the time what the breakthrough would mean in practical terms. Now we have a better idea with Alphabet announcing the creation of a new subsidiary called <a href="https://www.isomorphiclabs.com/blog"><ins>Isomorphic Labs</ins></a>.</p><p>The company states its goal is to “reimagine” the process of developing new drugs with an AI-first approach. “We believe that the foundational use of cutting edge computational and AI methods can help scientists take their work to the next level, and massively accelerate the drug discovery process,” Demis Hassabis, the founder and CEO of Isomorphic Labs said.

They’re both trying to address the problem of skyrocketing drug development costs. A recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054832"><ins>2020</ins></a> study found that it costs on average $1.3 billion to create a new pharmaceutical. A lot of that has to do with the process itself. As things stand today, researchers physically synthesize each and every promising compound and then test to see if it’s safe for human use. And as they have tried to develop treatments for more complicated diseases, fewer drugs are passing human trials.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-isomorphic-labs-announcement-193546886.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f4af1af-4430-477f-af02-d1fcd04a0a8b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 19:35:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636054550</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T19:36:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DeepMind]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot brings 'League of Legends,' Valorant' and other titles to Epic Games Store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Riot Games is taking its PC titles into new territory as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/league%20of%20legends/"><em><ins>League of Legends</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valorant/"><em><ins>Valorant</ins></em></a>, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> and <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> are all now available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Epic%20Games%20Store/"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>.

You can upgrade its capacity to 15.6 kWh and then 17.3 kWh. In 2022, Zero Motorcycles will start selling an optional tank accessory that further increases the amount of power the motorcycle’s ZF 75-10 electric motor can access. With every possible upgrade, battery capacity increases to 20.9 kWh. At that point, Zero claims you can expect approximately 227 miles of range when driving in a city and about 113 miles at a more consistent 70 miles per hour clip. For charging, the 2022 SR features a standard J1772 connection, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html">even Tesla sells now</a>.</p><p>By default, the 2022 SR’s motor outputs 122 lb-ft of torque and 74 horsepower. It can hit a top speed of 104 miles per hour. As you might have guessed, you can pay extra to unlock better performance from the motor. With a $1,795 in-app purchase, power output increases to 113 horsepower, allowing the 2022 SR to go as fast as 124 miles per hour.</p><p>The 2022 SR will start at $17,995 when it debuts at dealerships in the first quarter of 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-2022-sr-annoucement-181805528.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3091fdd-413c-4d31-a2f8-d8796c2bb6d0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:18:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636059719</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T21:02:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Muoverti says its tilting stationary bike feels like real cycling]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While nothing can truly match the real thing, a number of stationary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/exercise%20bike/"><ins>bike</ins></a> companies have tried to replicate the outdoor riding experience.

What&#39;s more, there are built-in gaming controls, so you can connect the bike to an Xbox and perhaps squeeze in some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/riders%20republic/"><em>Riders Republic</em></a> as you&#39;re getting a workout.

As it stands, some features that serious cyclists will be looking for don&#39;t seem to be available, such as vertical climb simulation, so it might be a better fit for more casual riders. Still, with its stylish frames, TiltBikes look a bit more like actual bikes than rival models.</p><p>Muoverti hasn&#39;t announced pricing for TiltBikes as yet, though given that some configurations don&#39;t include a display, they could prove less expensive than some other models. The company plans to ship the stationary bikes in 2022, giving you some time to find a decent wind machine to get the full outdoor riding effect.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64061c40-3cd7-11ec-8c7c-def61bcc25be" style="height:4000;width:6000;" alt="A rider on a Muoverti TiltBike using a virtual training experience that&#39;s displayed on a TV." data-uuid="ff99b530-215e-3de0-a853-5f0abf655333"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Muoverti</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/muoverti-tiltbike-stationary-bike-180005766.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b432a1db-cee5-4a00-a050-455870135187</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635966407</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T19:07:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5dac9770-3cd7-11ec-bcc9-24b2a7bf0cdf" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5dac9770-3cd7-11ec-bcc9-24b2a7bf0cdf" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Muoverti]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Muoverti TiltBike.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Muoverti TiltBike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['League of Legends' champion Jinx arrives in 'Fortnite']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Game marketing is creating more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pubg-mobile-tesla-update-145129031.html">strange bedfellows</a>.

Air transport industry figures are worried this could play havoc with flights, but telecoms claim there&#39;s no evidence to suggest the expanded 5G will create problems.</p><p>Both wireless networks have a strong incentive to keep any delays to a minimum. The C-band slice they&#39;re using (between 3.7GHz and 3.98GHz) represents a sweet spot for 5G service with more bandwidth than low- or mid-band 5G, but without nearly as much interference as millimeter wave frequencies. It could alleviate congestion in other frequency bands, too. The expansion promises a more substantial improvement over LTE that could drive subscriptions, not to mention more upgrades to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">5G phones</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b8f1313f-dca6-42f3-b531-8930ee511ae2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 16:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636044352</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T16:45:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a3b4000-3d89-11ec-8fff-01e6e8ef2ecf" width="4735" height="3142" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a3b4000-3d89-11ec-8fff-01e6e8ef2ecf" width="4735" height="3142" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[George Frey / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A contract crew from Verizon installs 5G telecommunications equipment on a tower in Orem, Utah, U.S. December 3, 2019.
