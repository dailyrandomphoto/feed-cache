As a relatively high-end device, however, it normally commands a pretty high price ($540) — but you can now pick one up at Amazon for just $399, for a savings of $141 (26 percent).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EhtTTt" id="cbb5de721f8a4a1ea10afdbe5a216c26" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iRobot Roomba i7">But iRobot Roomba i7 at Amazon - $399</a><p>You can program the Roomba i7 to clean at certain times, or just yell at Amazon&#39;s Alexa or Google Assistant to start it up if there&#39;s some unscheduled filth. Once in operation, it&#39;s one of iRobot&#39;s quietest vacuums yet thanks to a change in the placement of the motor. On top of that, it supposedly has twice the suction power as the Roomba 960.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It does a great job of avoiding obstacles and cleaning efficiently, thanks to the smart mapping feature that can create an entire plan of your house. You can then label each area and ask it to only clean specific rooms. It&#39;s ideal if you have pets, as the multi-surface robber brushes supposedly won&#39;t tangle up with pet hair. It also traps 99 percent of cat and dog dander allergens.&nbsp;</p><p>The i7 won&#39;t automatically empty its bag like the Roomba <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-05-roomba-i7-plus-review.html">i7+</a> or j7+, but guess what: the latter model is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-roomba-j7-vacuum-hits-new-all-time-low-in-i-robots-cyber-monday-sale-141515068.html">still</a> on sale at Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:all-time low price of $649" href="https://amzn.to/3EhtTTt">all-time low price of $649</a> ($200 off). The Roomba j7+ has many of the same features as the i7, but can dump its waste into a bin that you only need to empty every couple of months. It also has longer battery life and AI-powered vision that can detect pet waste and other nasty stuff. The only drawback is that it&#39;s not quite as good for low-pile carpet as the i7, and takes a bit longer to charge.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Fma0fw" id="991b11603e6444c5a9af5c4360b60ca1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iRobot Roomba j7+">Buy iRobot Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $649</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/i-robots-smart-mapping-roomba-i-7-is-on-sale-for-399-153501314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3284df5e-5273-42ce-95bf-d9a5fb43fb1f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 15:35:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640186251</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T15:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7b831480-6334-11ec-bfff-e772e0b27d1f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7b831480-6334-11ec-bfff-e772e0b27d1f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s smart-mapping Roomba i7 is on sale for $399]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to watch over the 2021 holidays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been a surprisingly solid year for television. Partially because many major film releases ended up hitting streaming services early. (Don&#39;t forget about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html">Warner Bros. unprecedented decision to stream their releases on HBO Max</a> when they hit theaters.) Film and TV productions that were delayed due to the pandemic in 2020 also managed to cross the finish line thanks to safer shooting schedules and vaccines. The result was a wealth of content for couch potatoes.</p><p>As you settle in for holiday celebrations, here are a few selections that you may have missed during the year. (And be sure to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/holiday-binge-watch-guide-160036471.html">check out our recommendations from last year</a>!)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Netflix</h2><h3>Arcane</h3><div id="9dfe924888324a26b1584a058b781eb6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Ps6nV4wiCE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I&#39;ll be honest: I didn&#39;t expect much from a <em>League of Legends</em> TV show. But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arcane" href="https://fave.co/3dubJmE"><em>Arcane</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>surprised me with its well-written characters, wonderfully realized fantasy world and luscious animation. While there are some killer action sequences, what really makes <em>Arcane </em>work is its commitment to mature storytelling. Characters you love will die. Villains are never one-note and heroes are never perfect. It&#39;s not only a solid video game adaptation, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html">one of the best TV shows to debut this year</a>.</p><h3>Midnight Mass</h3><div id="728eb65df3174ce292df9401be3d48ce"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Religious-focused horror may seem more like anti-holiday programming, but that&#39;s not going to stop us from recommending <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Midnight Mass" href="https://fave.co/3y5k49T"><em>Midnight Mass</em></a>. The show is an exploration of dogma, fanaticism, our connection to the cosmos and another compelling series from the rising horror master Mike Flanagan. Unlike his previous haunted house entries (<em>The Haunting of Hill House </em>and <em>Bly Manor</em>), <em>Midnight Mass</em> focuses on a small island community off the coast of Massachusetts, the sort of place that has its own demons festering under the surface. I won&#39;t spoil what happens, but it&#39;s the sort of thing that fans of Stephen King will eat up.</p><h3>Also on Netflix:</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:The Power of the Dog" href="https://fave.co/3lMx3sa"><em>The Power of the Dog</em></a><em>: </em>Jane Campion returns to feature films with a hauntingly beautiful Western. Benedict Cumberbatch steals the show as a monstrous cowboy poisoned by the spell of toxic masculinity.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Voir" href="https://fave.co/3pAKjB7"><em>Voir</em></a>: The latest Netflix project from director David Fincher is a series of visual essays about the power of cinema from some of the best critics and thinkers today.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Gabby&#39;s Dollhouse" href="https://fave.co/3rMZbis"><em>Gabby&#39;s Dollhouse</em></a>: An adorable cat-themed show about a young girl who goes on the occasional dollhouse adventure.</p><h2>HBO Max</h2><h3>Hacks</h3><div id="087f2d30a19b4d06b856d83a1c012a0a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpE4893PxqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>A once-legendary comedian (Jean Smart) is forced to team up with a young, semi-cancelled writer (Hannah Einbinder) to whip her act into shape. Hilarity ensues. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hacks" href="https://fave.co/3GmP2gH"><em>Hacks</em></a> takes this simple sitcom premise and elevates it with Smart&#39;s ferocious performance. On the face of it, it&#39;s a story about two creative generations learning to coexist. But really, it&#39;s the story of lost people finding direction in each other. It&#39;s the sort of genius comedy and drama we&#39;d expect from the folks behind <em>Broad City.</em></p><h3>Starstruck</h3><div id="95d00edbeccc4b2aae36d696d5380ff6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bn92F4a3l4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>A lost twenty-something (Rose Matafeo) accidentally has a one-night stand with a movie star (Nikesh Patel). Again, hilarity ensues. (HBO Max really has a knack for collecting great show premises!) <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Starstruck" href="https://fave.co/3lLQalU"><em>Starstruck</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is the rare season of TV that you can easily binge all at once—it&#39;s just six twenty-two minute episodes. But I&#39;d recommend taking your time. Matafeo is uproariously funny, but there&#39;s also a romantic undercurrent that makes you root for these crazy kids.</p><h3>Also on HBO:</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:The White Lotus" href="https://fave.co/3pAKAnD"><em>The White Lotus</em></a><em>: </em>Rich resort-goers vs. the people who are forced to cater to them.

Set in a rural Oklahoma reservation, it follows a group of teenagers as they get into trouble, help their community, and pursue their dream of moving to the promised land of California. It&#39;s the first TV series to feature an entirely Indigenous crew of writers and directors (it was co-created by the ever-delightful Taiki Waititi), and it&#39;s a reminder of how the push for better on-screen representation can lead to fresh storytelling.</p><h3>Also on Hulu:</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Top of the Lake" href="https://fave.co/3dw5Kh5"><em>Top of the Lake</em></a><em>: </em>If you&#39;re looking for a smart crime thriller, don&#39;t sleep on this Jane Campion series.

My advice? Get past the rocky first two episodes to find the show&#39;s true genius: NASA&#39;s push to get more women, and eventually people of color, into space. If it miraculously lasts several seasons, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:For All Mankind" href="https://fave.co/31DPDeO"><em>For All Mankind</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>shows us how something like <em>Star Trek&#39;s</em> space-faring society could be formed.</p><h3>Also on Apple TV+:</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dr. Brain" href="https://fave.co/3pGMF1x"><em>Dr. Brain</em></a><em>: </em>Apple&#39;s first Korean series, from visionary director Kim Jee-woon, explores the possibility of downloading and reliving someone else&#39;s memories.

Clint Barton has never been the most interesting Avenger, but he&#39;s fantastic as the foil to Kate Bishop, a plucky arrow-slinging protege.

Realme, the sister brand of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-launches-a-pac-man-addition-of-its-nord-2-smartphone-132509111.html">OnePlus</a>, announced that its upcoming flagship <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/realme-gt-2-pro-paper-tech-master-design-naoto-fukasawa-130035106.html">GT 2 Pro</a> features an eco-friendly bio-polymer material on its back cover — apparently a first in the mobile industry. Better yet, Realme has once <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-realme-x-garlic-onion-master-edition-naoto-fukasawa.html">again</a> collaborated with Muji and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-19-kddi-infobar-a03-smartphone.html">Infobar</a> series design icon Naoto Fukasawa, who finished the GT 2 Pro&#39;s design with a textured paper feel on the body. They call this &quot;Paper Tech Master Design.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3fe9a080-6328-11ec-bcae-41e9a7555837" alt="Realme GT 2 Pro" data-uuid="d4acb47a-93be-32d3-aa48-c0241b6556e3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>This bio-polymer material, supplied by Saudi Arabia&#39;s SABIC, is based on paper pulp, and it has obtained International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (or ISCC in short) to prove its environmental friendliness. The Realme GT 2 Pro&#39;s packaging also uses much less plastic than its predecessor — from an overall plastic ratio of 21.7 percent down to a mere 0.3 percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The phone itself packs some surprises, too. For one, it&#39;s one of the first devices to be powered by Qualcomm&#39;s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, following the <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/motorola-moto-edge-x30-edge-s30-132744690.html">Moto Edge X30</a>. The GT 2 Pro is also the world&#39;s first smartphone with a 150-degree ultra-wide camera (most are at around 120 degrees), which offers a unique fisheye camera mode for some fun photography.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some noteworthy features on the radio side. In Realme&#39;s &quot;Antenna Array Matrix System&quot; here, there&#39;s the &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; ultra-wide-band antenna switching technology, which lets the phone switch to whichever of the 12 antennas has the best signal strength. In addition, this system consists of a symmetrical Wi-Fi antenna which apparently boosts signal stability by up to 20 percent.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7ff0f6f0-6329-11ec-97ef-9b6f0d2f4049" alt="NFC 3 antenna array" data-uuid="62bb92c6-0154-382a-9448-130c4a8dec15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>But the most interesting feature here is perhaps the &quot;360-degree NFC,&quot; which is achieved by hooking up the NFC module to the top two cellular antennas as well as its own, thus forming an &quot;NFC 3 antenna array.&quot; This allows the upper part of the GT 2 Pro to read NFC on either side, which should make the likes of contactless payment and Bluetooth pairing easier.</p><p>For now, the Realme GT 2 Pro is only slated for a China launch at 7:30PM local time (6:30AM ET) on January 4th, 2022, but a company spokesperson confirmed that it will eventually go overseas. Given the brand&#39;s track record, this device will likely be competitively priced, but we&#39;re just eager to check out Fukasawa&#39;s latest mobile design in person — especially the supposedly paper-like texture. Stay tuned for more technical specs, prices and our hands-on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-2-pro-sustainability-naoto-fukasawa-135537116.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ae42172-a8b6-4f1d-b6a2-dfec9949b045</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 13:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640180702</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T13:45:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a865e680-631b-11ec-abbf-092668b9f3f3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a865e680-631b-11ec-abbf-092668b9f3f3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Realme]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Realme GT 2 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Realme GT 2 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA delays James Webb telescope launch due to poor weather]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is finally ready for launch after 14 years in development. NASA cleared its launch readiness review and gave it the go-ahead for launch, which was supposed to take place on December 24th. Unfortunately, poor weather conditions have <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/21/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-update/">prompted</a> the agency to delay its launch yet again. James Webb will be lifting off from Europe&#39;s Spaceport in French Guiana on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket with the new target date of December 25th and a launch window of between 7:20 AM and 7:52 AM Eastern time.</p><p>This is the closest the telescope has ever gotten to starting its month-long journey towards its destination. It&#39;s been delayed numerous times in the past due to one reason or another — NASA targeted an October launch date after its development was delayed by the pandemic, but it determined that the telescope wouldn&#39;t be ready until November or December.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA (and its partners, the European and Canadian space agencies) then targeted a December 18th launch date, before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">pushing it back</a> to December 22nd. The James Webb team needed the extra time to inspect the telescope and make sure nothing was damaged during an incident that happened at testing. Its launch was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html">delayed</a> to December 24th after that because of a communication issue between the telescope and its Ariane 5 launch vehicle. This time, NASA had already conducted a news conference confirming that the telescope is ready for launch before announcing the new target date.</p><p>After the James Webb telescope arrives in its orbit near the second Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system, researchers around the world will be able to use it to peer at some of the universe&#39;s earliest galaxies, look into black holes and assess exoplanets&#39; habitability. NASA will confirm the new launch date this evening.</p><div id="02df22879b8d4f6b843ff6b7b2313a68"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to adverse weather conditions at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, the James Webb Space Telescope’s launch is postponed from Dec. 24 to no earlier than Dec. 25.

But Ubisoft appears to have minted about somewhere north of 3,000 NFTs, total.

And, no, we don’t mean Chrome. As of today, the privacy-focused Vivaldi browser is available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html"><ins>Polestar 2 vehicles</ins></a>. It’s a first for Android Automotive and the company, which had yet to offer its software on vehicles before today.</p><p>Vivaldi says safety was one of its top priorities when porting the browser over to Android Automotive. To that end, it’s only possible to start a session when your car is parked. If you start streaming something and then resume driving, Vivaldi will limit the video to audio-only.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, privacy was also a priority for the team. The browser won’t store your browsing data on the car whenever you open a private tab. If you want to transfer your data between devices, you can do so by signing into your Vivaldi account. That information is something the company says Polestar won’t be able to access.</p><p>The Android Automotive version of Vivaldi is based on the company’s mobile release. You won’t find some functionality that is available in the desktop version – for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-accordion-tab-stacks-070000491.html"><ins>accordion tabs</ins></a> are missing – and Vivaldi has disabled a handful of other features. It’s not possible to download files and scan QR codes, for example. Otherwise, there aren’t many differences between the Android Automotive release and other versions of Vivaldi, and the company says updates will come at a regular cadence.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-android-automotive-polestar-2-120011646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3234f11c-cad0-44d3-a829-b98b045fff58</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639687188</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T20:40:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivaldi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[RadioShack is building a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RadioShack — yes, <em>that</em> RadioShack that used to sell electronic goods — is now a crypto business. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-05-radioshack-files-for-bankruptcy-as-sprint-eyes-its-stores.html">filed</a> for bankruptcy back in 2015 after 11 unprofitable quarters in a row, bringing it&#39;s almost 100-year history to an end. After that, the former retail chain&#39;s branding rights were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-13-radioshack-brand-sold.html">sold</a> several times until they were acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures Review (REV). If you visit <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/?sscid=c1k5_opb4u&amp;">RadioShack&#39;s website</a> right now, you&#39;ll see a banner talking about its new mission to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream. You&#39;ll also see a sign up section to be notified as soon as its RADIO token launches.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/radioshack-is-getting-into-the-crypto-business/"><em>CNET</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/radioshack-turns-to-crypto-with-radio-tokens"><em>Tom&#39;s Hardware</em></a> explain, RadioShack is building a Decentralized Finance ecosystem in partnership with the Atlas USV (Universal Store of Value) protocol. Atlas was designed by Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, who are also the duo behind REV. RadioShack&#39;s DeFi ecosystem will start with a decentralized exchange, which the company describes as the &quot;lowest hanging fruit that is full of opportunities&quot; on its website. When it&#39;s up, the DeFi exchange will allow users to send cryptocurrency directly to each other rather than through an exchange service like Coinbase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on what&#39;s written on RadioShack&#39;s website, REV is hoping that the &quot;100-year-old brand&quot; is embedded enough &quot;into the global consciousness&quot; to encourage widespread crypto adoption. It&#39;s even hoping that RadioShack could become the gateway for large corporations like Starbucks and Louis Vuitton to becoming blockchain companies. It&#39;s a lofty goal, especially for a brand that declared bankruptcy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-30-lawsuit-sprint-caused-radioshack-bankruptcy.html">twice</a> within the span of a few years. If you&#39;re interested in reading REV&#39;s plan for RadioShack, though, you can check out its documentation for the project on <a href="https://docs.radioshack.com/radioshack-defi/fundamentals/why-radioshack-defi">its website</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/radioshack-decentralized-cryptocurrency-exchange-114743980.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7282875c-d34a-4a78-ae64-427a3199094d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 11:47:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640171944</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T11:19:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/02b52d10-630f-11ec-9fde-8042bcf1359a" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/02b52d10-630f-11ec-9fde-8042bcf1359a" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[cbarnesphotography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[St. Louis, Missouri, USA - January 6, 2015: With a weathered, worn sign above the door, a RadioShack (NYSE: RSH) retail store located on Brentwood Boulevard in St. Louis, Missouri announces clearance sales with store signs in windows.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RadioShack Saint Louis electronics retail outlet announces clearance]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zillow adds FaceTime SharePlay to browse homes with friends]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zillow has updated its iOS 15 iPhone and iPad apps with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html">SharePlay</a> support, letting you browse homes with other people on Facetime, the company <a href="http://zillow.mediaroom.com/2021-12-21-Americas-favorite-pastime-Zillow-surfing-is-now-a-group-sport-with-SharePlay-on-iPhone-and-iPad">announced</a>. iOS users can start a group FaceTime call and then enable SharePlay to browse through Zillow&#39;s photo galleries so everyone on the call can see the property.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Americans love to Zillow surf — most of them alongside someone else — and now they have a new way to do it,&quot; according to Zillow. &quot;Using the Zillow app on an iPhone or iPad, home shoppers are now able to search and browse for-sale home and rental listings in a seamless, synchronous experience together with family, friends or a real estate agent.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zillow said that 86 percent of users browse homes with a partner, spouse or housemate, so the new feature makes sense if you can&#39;t be together in person.

Amazon, Meta, Twitter and T-Mobile have announced that they&#39;re no longer attending the event in person due to the threat brought about by the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The show earlier this year was a strictly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2021-what-to-expect-210017996.html">online-only affair</a>, but the Consumer Technology Association announced in April that the event is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-in-person-las-vegas-143003027.html">returning</a> as an in-person affair in 2022. While the organizer requires attendees to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-proof-of-vaccination-requirement-151808496.html">show proof</a> of vaccination to be able to attend the expo, the Omicron variant&#39;s emergence prompted companies to reconsider their plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=WJKVI5nK"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement that it&#39;ll no longer have an on-site presence at the event &quot;due to the quickly shifting situation and uncertainty around the Omicron variant.&quot; Its smart home subsidiary Ring will no longer be attending, as well. Meanwhile, Facebook parent company Meta said it won&#39;t be attending the expo in person anymore &quot;due to the evolving public health concerns related to COVID-19.&quot; It might participate in the event in a virtual capacity, but the company has yet to release more concrete details.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Similarly, Twitter has canceled its in-person appearance &quot;due to the spike in Covid cases across the country in the past week.&quot; It&#39;s reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-will-not-attend-ces-person-over-covid-19-concerns-2021-12-21/">exploring</a> ways to be able to participate virtually, as well. Even CES sponsor T-Mobile has chosen to step back and <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022">limit</a> its on-site participation. &quot;While we are confident that CES organizers are taking exhaustive measures to protect in-person attendees and we had many preventative practices in place as well, we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees with this decision,&quot; it said in a statement. Other companies that have chosen to cancel include <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/ces-2022-covid-19-omicron-cancel-facebook-meta-twitter-pinterest-drop-plans-2664407">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/ces-2022-tmobile-amazon-iheartradio-cancel-covid-1235141979/">iHeartRadio</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s still a lot of unknown factors surrounding the Omicron variant, but researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant.html">have found</a> it to be a highly transmissible strain. Further, what they&#39;ve discovered suggests that most non-mRNA vaccines (such as Sinovac and Sinopharm) offer almost no protection against the variant. At the moment, though, the CTA has yet to announce any changes to the event, and the in—person expo is still scheduled to take place in January.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e863d83-4663-4ffe-b9dd-19de39349a78</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:58:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640163529</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T08:58:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/01/20: In this photo illustration, a hand of a person holds a smartphone with a Consumer Electronics Show (CES) logo displayed in the background.

It&#39;s a vertical display with a 2,560 x 2,880-pixel resolution that LG is calling &quot;Square Double QHD.&quot; When you use its vertical split view function, the DualUp looks like you put two 21.5—inch monitors on top of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be a better form factor than the typical monitor if you&#39;re constantly having to look at information on multiple windows or screens for work or for any other reason. In its announcement, LG says the model will help reduce side-to-side head movements that cause neck pain. DualUp was also meant to save space and will ship with the LG Ergo stand that clamps to most desks and tables. The Nano IPS monitor&#39;s other features include a brightness of 300 nits, a 1000:1 contrast ratio and HDR10 support.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to DualUp, LG has also introduced the UltraFine, a 32-inch 4K UHD monitor. It has a more conventional aspect ratio, but it is the first to use LG&#39;s Nano IPS Black panel technology, which enables a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The company will reveal more about both premium monitors at its virtual press event on January 4th. It&#39;s unknown at this point whether LG will still push through with a physical experience at CES 2022, assuming the event will still take place despite the threat posed by the Omicron variant. It was planning on showcasing a list of new items during the conference aside from these monitors, though, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html">soundbar</a> with a center up-firing speaker, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">wireless TV on wheels</a> and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED TV with a motorized cover</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-dualup-monitor-051303157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b44c61f8-811b-41df-90f8-324bbfc46e46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 05:13:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640149986</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T05:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Both the LG UltraFineâ¢ Display (model 32UQ85R) and LG DualUp Monitor (model 28MQ780) offer sleek and practical designs, enhanced connectivity and superior user experience for both home and office workers, including creative professionals and programmers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG-DualUp-Lifestyle-00]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Voice now lets you decide who goes to voicemail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google now lets you customize how its Voice service <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/set-custom-rules-for-incoming-google-voice-calls.html">handles incoming calls</a>.

The company has <a href="https://tascam.com/us/magazines/detail/866">introduced</a> a 424 Studio Master High Bias Type II Cassette designed for the brand&#39;s decades-old Portastudio four-track cassette recorders. Artists can record analog samples and tunes without hunting down rare tapes and fretting over degradation.</p><p>The cassette isn&#39;t a perfect match. Tascam said it&#39;s using existing magnetic oxides to produce tape that&#39;s as close &quot;as possible&quot; to the material Portastudios were meant to use, but recorder owners may still have to do some &quot;fine tuning&quot; to adjust for 2021-era cassettes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, this isn&#39;t just an appeal to nostalgia — to some extent, it&#39;s about the preservation of analog cassette recording. Cassette production has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-cassette-tape-material-shortage.html">suffering from oxide shortages</a> since 2019, years after a (still-ongoing) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cassette-inventor-lou-ottens-has-died-213101596.html">tape revival</a>. Tascam noted that it&#39;s now the sole company making High Bias Type II cassettes. While there are tapes already on the market, they&#39;re both rare and expensive.</p><p>Availability is only listed as &quot;soon.&quot; Tascam&#39;s cassettes also won&#39;t satisfy creators who want genuinely new recorders to replace a shrinking supply of old hardware. This might be the next best thing, though, and could be a relief for Portastudio fans who don&#39;t want to make a complete leap into the digital realm.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tascam-new-cassettes-old-four-track-recorders-202319184.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b884cc1-1287-443a-96d4-fbafd4e594b9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 20:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640119434</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T20:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tascam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' final commemorative Xbox sneakers are now on sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html"><ins>October</ins></a>, Microsoft and Adidas have been releasing commemorative Xbox-themed sneakers to mark the brand&#39;s 20th anniversary. It all started with a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html">Forum Tech</a> shoes the two companies gave away to a group of lucky fans.

As with the other sneakers in the series, you&#39;ll find plenty of clever references. For instance, the inner lining of the shoes draws on the design of the Xbox Series X&#39;s vents. Meanwhile, the heel and sole of shoes mirror the grips of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Overall, we wanted to create a shoe that cemented a moment in time, but also felt timeless,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;This is a shoe that is meant to be played in, meant to be worn, and meant to be enjoyed by our community – one that&#39;s always played in, and never played out.&quot;</p><p>You can buy the Xbox Series X Forum Tech Boost from the <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/xbox-forum-techboost-shoes/GW6374.html">Adidas website for $140</a>. If you&#39;re not a sneakerhead, Microsoft has released other commemorative products to mark the console&#39;s 20th birthday, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-transluscent-controller-160707355.html"><ins>translucent controller</ins></a> that pays homage to the original Xbox debug kit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-xbox-series-x-sneakers-193013642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35bf698a-7004-4f09-99f0-f644b61a4af7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640114066</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T19:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft / Adidas]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo offers a first look at its desktop web browser]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/duckduckgo/"><ins>DuckDuckGo</ins></a> has offered an early peek at its upcoming desktop app. In <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/"><ins>a blog post</ins></a> that recaps the company&#39;s year, CEO Gabriel Weinberg looked toward the future as well. He said DuckDuckGo will bring the privacy protections the company is known for to the app. You can expect the speed and simplicity of its mobile app too.</p><p>&quot;Robust privacy protection&quot; will be enabled by default for search, browsing, email and more. Weinberg said the app isn&#39;t a &quot;privacy browser&quot; per se, but rather &quot;an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it did on mobile, DuckDuckGo is building the app using OS-provided rendering engines instead of basing it on projects like Chromium. According to Weinberg, that helped the development team to &quot;strip away a lot of the unnecessary cruft and clutter that’s accumulated over the years in major browsers.&quot;</p><p>Along with a streamlined interface and the Fire Button (which closes all tabs and wipes browsing data in a single tap), the DuckDuckGo desktop is cleaner and much more private than Chrome, Weinberg said. He also claimed it&#39;s &quot;significantly faster&quot; than Google&#39;s browser, based on early tests — here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s less of a memory hog than Chrome too. DuckDuckGo didn&#39;t reveal when it plans to release the desktop app.</p><p>Weinberg notes that, over the last 12 months, DuckDuckGo has bolstered its search and tracker blocking features. He said DuckDuckGo&#39;s mobile app is now the most downloaded Android browser in key markets. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-email-protection-tracking-pixels-privacy-151024634.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> a free email forwarding service that removes tracking pixels from messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-desktop-app-browser-privacy-184913408.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da314e59-b769-4a7a-aaf2-80a878aa8f73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:49:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640112556</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T18:49:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey caused an uproar with a bizarre Web3 Twitter rant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the internet’s most vocal proponents of Bitcoin voiced an unusually uncharacteristic opinion against Web3 this week.

That&#39;s a not-so-subtle dig at the onslaught of reboots and remakes dominating our culture — revisiting characters and stories we already know is, well, safe. Audiences know what to expect, and it&#39;s a better bet for risk-averse studios. Of course, Morpheus (now played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen) is also commenting on the film he&#39;s in.</p><p>More than twenty years after <em>The Matrix</em> fundamentally reshaped genre cinema, director Lana Wachowski is finally diving back into the universe that made her and co-director Lilly Wachowski renowned. After all that time, is it really worth going back down the rabbit hole, or is this just another easy franchise cash-grab?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The answer to that question depends on what you want from a <em>Matrix </em>sequel. Like <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> and <em>Revolutions </em>before it, Wachowski (along with co-writers David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon) isn&#39;t interested in merely retreading the past with <em>Resurrections</em>. Instead, it&#39;s a film that&#39;s keenly aware of its legacy, our relationship with its characters, and the lofty expectations that fans (and studios!) have when rebooting a beloved property.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d252-626c-11ec-9ffb-6eb31f3af5eb" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="6731a42e-5529-369a-953b-b6b815399259"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>As someone who adored the original film, and found plenty to respect in the much-maligned sequels, <em>Resurrections</em> feels made just for me. It&#39;s intoxicating, thrilling and unabashedly romantic. But judging from the polarizing early critical responses, it&#39;s clearly not for everyone.</p><div id="23e3dca2e84a4e2999cefc4162bf8f87"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><strong><em>Minor spoilers ahead.</em></strong></p><p>It&#39;s hard to talk about what <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> is without describing its basic setup, most of which you can gather from the film&#39;s trailers. Keanu Reeves returns as Thomas Anderson, a programmer adrift in a world that doesn&#39;t quite make sense to him. He meets a woman played by Carrie-Anne Moss, but this time she&#39;s not the Agent-whupping bad-ass Trinity, she&#39;s just your typical (albeit, strikingly beautiful) mom. The two feel an instant connection. Thomas eventually gets ripped out of the world he&#39;s in thanks to a plucky new character named Bugs (Jessica Henwick), he finds the real world, and <em>yadda yadda</em>, you get the picture.</p><p>Now, you might be asking yourself, &quot;Didn&#39;t Neo and Trinity die in <em>The Matrix Revolutions?&quot; </em>All I can do is point at the title of the movie — what did you expect? This time, Anderson is a renowned game developer known for creating an popular trilogy of games that retell the entire <em>Matrix</em> story. When we first meet him, he&#39;s faced with a new challenge: making a fourth entry. He approaches it with the same sense of dread the Wachowskis likely felt about tackling a potential <em>Matrix 4</em>. A series of brainstorming scenes feel as if they&#39;re pulled directly from their own hellish meetings with Warner Bros. Anderson&#39;s team can only focus on the surface — How do they go beyond bullet time? What if they just focus on more mindless action? — rather than anything truly substantive.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6608d6c96de34f6c857fcefc7a348e92" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-bacb-dfd87aec35f5" alt="Neo vs. Morpheus. inThe Matrix Resurrections"></section><p>As the film unfolds (and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not revealing any  major surprises), it&#39;s  impressive how Lana Wachowski elegantly avoids the traps most reboots fall into, as if she were in the Matrix herself, deftly avoiding all of the bullets aimed right at her. Sure, <em>Resurrections</em> brings some new special effects toys to the party, and it has the requisite action scenes you&#39;d expect. But in many ways it&#39;s more reminiscent of the Wachowski&#39;s recent works, like the time-hopping epic <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, and the unabashedly humanistic <em>Sense8</em>.</p><p><em>The Matrix Resurrections </em>wears its heart on its sleeve. It&#39;s far more interested in the transcendental possibilities of love than it is in laying the groundwork for a new trilogy of films. The fact that Wachowski is practically refusing to play by the current rules of Hollywood – set up the sequel by any means necessary! – feels almost revolutionary. She has one story to tell, and it means a lot to her. That’s it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3341e7f0-626c-11ec-9fef-39dad80f80d4" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="42032915-0055-3d23-8122-50308f99a39d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>Strangely enough, the movie <em>Resurrections </em>reminds me of most is Wes Craven’s <em>A New Nightmare</em>, a groundbreaking attempt at wrestling with a hugely popular genre franchise. That film – the seventh<em> A Nightmare on Elm Street </em>entry – brought Freddy Krueger into the real world to reclaim what made him terrifying. Throughout <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, it feels as if Wachowski is also ready to break the fourth wall with her sheer contempt for reboots, fan service and watered-down sequels. “The sheeple want control, certainty,” a villain says at one point. (At that moment, I couldn’t help but think of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html">utter failure of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a><em>. </em>Yes, the wound is still fresh.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-a7f7-0cdb34fc728d" alt="Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="541f946b-509a-3665-a268-55332506d96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>And this is where I come back to saying this movie isn’t for everyone. But that just makes it a <em>Matrix</em> sequel. Sure, <em>Reloaded</em> and <em>Revolutions</em> were a bit overstuffed and convoluted, but they were also  singular visions that took some major swings.

Last year it took its recreation of the iconic chorus from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-jun-6-chorus-roland-juno-synth-plugin-free-080042654.html">Juno-6</a> and turned it into a stand alone effect. This year, it&#39;s breaking out the tape effects from its Mellotron emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>The original Mellotron is, of course, an iconic keyboard that played back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-21-mellotron-walkman-keyboard-crudman.html">tape loops</a> of other instruments — kind of like a proto-sampler. Arturia caught wind that some artists were using their Mellotron V plugin in an unexpected way. They were loading custom samples in and, rather than playing them back as a melody with the keyboard, simply adding the warmth and vibe of the simulated tape loops.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So this holiday season Arturia decided to just cut out the middleman and release Tape Mello-Fi as a standalone tape simulator plugin. It can add distortion, saturation, tape flutters and even some filtering. Its interface is simple and delivers everything from subtle warmth to full on machine malfunctions. There are even 25 presets included to get you started.</p><p>Of course, there are <em>tons</em> of lo-fi and tape simulation plugins out there. But Arturia&#39;s is particularly good. And, it&#39;s free. So there&#39;s really no reason not to grab it. And you should do it sooner than later. Tape Mello-Fi will be available as a free download from <a href="https://www.arturia.com/">Arturia&#39;s site</a> from December 21st through Friday December 31st. After that, well, who knows.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-free-tape-mello-fi-plugin-christmas-160020059.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ca1c117-f83b-4e19-b877-1fa788979dc0</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640023370</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T18:02:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researcher hacked an at-home COVID-19 test to give bogus results]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/find-out-if-you-have-covid-from-the-comfort-of-your-own-home-173043438.html">At-home COVID-19 tests</a> might not be as trustworthy as you&#39;d hope — not in the hands of a committed hacker, at least. As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22847222/ellume-at-home-covid-test-bluetooth-android-certification">notes</a>, F-Secure researcher Ken Gannon <a href="https://labs.f-secure.com/blog/faking-a-positive-covid-test">discovered</a> a since-patched security flaw in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-19-test-us-government-contract-ellume-180854993.html">Ellume&#39;s</a> Bluetooth-connected nasal swab test that let him change the reported results. The vulnerability was complicated, but still disconcerting.</p><p>Gannon used a rooted Android device to inspect the Bluetooth traffic Ellume&#39;s lateral flow tester was sending to the company&#39;s mobile app. The researcher pinpointed the traffic used to indicate test results, and wrote scripts to change the outcome. F-Secure Marketing Manager Alexandra Rinehimer even managed to fool Azova, a company issuing certificates for US entry tests, when it supervised her test.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ellume has made it harder to study and modify the data, and it&#39;s not clear iPhone or iPad users could replicate the same feat. The company is also building a portal to help officials verify at-home tests, and has determined that all previous tests were authentic.</p><p>Even so, the findings raise concerns about people using other flaws (including for other tests) to falsify their COVID-19 results. Someone with enough know-how could flip results negative to re-enter the US or a particular workplace while infected. Although the effort currently involved makes that fraud unlikely on a large scale, it wouldn&#39;t take many bogus results to lead to outbreaks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ellume-covid-19-test-bluetooth-hack-153933652.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb49f65d-a775-44c0-bfb4-2083f2b6910e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:39:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640101177</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T15:40:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fc900650-626c-11ec-9f77-a1607aba3a45" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fc900650-626c-11ec-9f77-a1607aba3a45" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ellume]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ellume at-home COVID-19 test]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ellume at-home COVID-19 test]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
