On March 26th, the company is bumping up the price of its streaming bundle by a dollar to $13.99 per month. That gets you access to Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu with ads (the ad-free version will cost you extra).

With a small subset of iOS and Android users, Twitter has started testing full-sized picture previews, allowing users to see timeline images in their original aspect ratio.</p><p>Before starting today’s test, Twitter cropped all non-16:9 images to maintain uniformity on your timeline. Provided a tweet only includes one image and it’s in a relatively standard aspect ratio, the change will make it so that you don’t have to tap on an image to see it in its entirety. In theory, that should make the experience of browsing through your timeline more streamlined.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, the company announced that it’s also testing a feature that allows people to upload 4K-quality images from their iPhone or Android device.

(And we all know Leonardo is the best, <em>come on</em>.) Thankfully, the game appears to recreate the original sprite-based aesthetic with the smoothness of modern 60FPS gameplay. And while the development teams are being coy about additional enhancements, I&#39;m hoping we get a chance to play as Splinter and April too.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge-brawler-160239522.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca9b4239-5a27-4397-951b-14cea19bb425</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 16:02:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615392162</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T16:02:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e396f9a0-81b8-11eb-bb7f-1a0d66eae4ec" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e396f9a0-81b8-11eb-bb7f-1a0d66eae4ec" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dotemu/Tribute Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Learn Python programming for web apps, data science and more with this $35 training]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There’s no shortage of resume-friendly skills out there, but any discerning job hunter knows they can’t learn them all.

Blizzard has released a patch that, among the usual fixes and tweaks, optimizes the graphics for Microsoft&#39;s latest consoles. You now have a &quot;Preferred Mode&quot; option that lets you prioritize resolution, frame rate, or a balance between the two — and the improvements could be substantial regardless of the system you own.</p><p>The &quot;Resolution&quot; mode focuses on sharpness at the potential expense of image quality, topping out at 4K and 60Hz on the Xbox Series X and 1440p (also 60Hz) on the Series S. &quot;Balanced,&quot; as the name implies, prefers image quality while maintaining a strong resolution, hitting 1440p at 60Hz on the Series X and 1080p at that speed on the Series S. &quot;Framerate,&quot; meanwhile, pushes the game to a highly responsive 120Hz while sacrificing both image fidelity and resolution (1440p on Series X, 1080p on Series S).

That’s why some people have turned to devices that mimic the arrival of daylight as a gentler way to stir from slumber. So-called sunrise or wake-up-light clocks typically start out with a dim light and then gradually brighten to full brightness in order to match your body’s circadian rhythms. If you have a particularly tough time waking up, you probably do still need an alarm, but the sunrise light should at least make it easier.</p><p>There are several products on the market that have this feature; some are alarm clocks, some are smart displays, while others are simply programmable lights. Some only have sunrise features, while others have sunset features too (where the lights gradually dim and go dark), which could help you get to sleep in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Sunrise and wake-up clocks</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/120aaa40-80ef-11eb-bcff-e2327ee9b8b4" alt="Philips SmartSleep Connected Sleep and Wake-Up Light" data-uuid="452fed45-be8a-3185-8fbd-266cae934df7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Philips</div></figure><h3>Philips SmartSleep Connected Sleep and Wake-up Light</h3><p>Philips sells a whole range of sunrise alarm clocks, and the one with the most bells and whistles is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3uMIaUY" target="_self">SmartSleep Connected Sleep and Wake-Up Light</a>. You can use a companion app to program your sunrise and sunset times as well as set different alarms for different days of the week. You can do that manually too, but the app makes it a lot easier. You can use the app for logging your sleep and wake times. The SmartSleep also offers several alarm sounds, customizable sunrise themes and a red-tinted light setting that’s more soothing than the default white light.</p><p>In addition, you’ll find specialized sunset features that can help you wind down before bed. The light can be set to gradually dim over time, and it comes with relaxation cues like breathing exercises and calming sounds, like rainfall and ocean waves. As a bonus, the SmartSleep HF3670 also has sensors for humidity, light and noise levels, and the app will let you know if you need to adjust them to achieve ideal sleeping conditions.</p><p>For a cheaper and more stripped-down option, consider <a href="https://amzn.to/2NSx7sB" target="_self">Philips’ $100 Wake-Up Light HF3520</a>. It lacks WiFi capabilities so there’s no companion app and it doesn’t have the extra relaxation settings of the SmartSleep, but it still includes that red-tinted light setting, along with similar sunrise and sunset features and a decent array of alarm sounds.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uMIaUY" target="_self">Buy Smart Sleep light at Amazon - $180</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2NSx7sB" target="_self">Buy Wake-up light at Amazon - $100</a></p><h3>Hatch Restore</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/56030440-80e0-11eb-9ff7-bb1c5bbb4c36" alt="Hatch Restore" data-uuid="81bbaedf-44d4-3402-ada5-5fd746a1285b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hatch</div></figure><p></p><p>If getting to sleep is just as challenging as waking up, if not more so, you might want to consider the <a href="https://amzn.to/3dZAmcr" target="_self">Hatch Restore</a>, which brings a bunch of sleep-friendly features. It has Bluetooth and WiFi, which you can use to connect to a companion app. That app in turn lets you customize your sunrise and sunset routines as well as set different alarms for different days. On top of that, the Hatch Restore has several color lighting options that range from Warm White to Peach and Raspberry.</p><p>True to its name, the Restore has various wind-down features that could help you fall asleep more easily. It has over 31 sleep sounds to block unwanted noise, plus a library of over 50 meditations and eight sleep stories. The caveat here is that the meditations and stories aren’t free. Hatch will offer owners a free trial of the full library for six months, but it costs $5 a month or $50 a year thereafter. That said, if you wanted an all-in-one machine to help address your sleep and wake issues, the Hatch Restore might be worth a look.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3dZAmcr" target="_self">Buy Hatch Restore at Amazon - $130</a></p><h2>Smart display clocks</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/69130a90-80df-11eb-97ee-ebba7779e528" alt="Lenovo Smart Clock" data-uuid="ade831b3-c35a-3d2b-99b8-c2f35e8210c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h3>Lenovo Smart Clock</h3><p>Almost all smart displays have some kind of sunrise alarm feature, especially the ones that are designed to sit on your nightstand. The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Zdb7nW" target="_self">Lenovo Smart Clock</a> is one of our favorites, even if it lacks many of the usual smart display features like the ability to play videos. That’s because it’s adorable, won’t take up a lot of space and it’s affordable, to boot. Plus, it comes with eight different clock faces, six alarm tones and you can smack the top of it to either snooze or dismiss the alarm. When enabled, the sunrise alarm will gradually brighten the display for 30 minutes before the set time.</p><p>Since it’s a Google-powered device, it also works with all the usual Google Assistant features like telling you the five-day weather forecast or your upcoming appointments. It surfaces reminders of future events plus offers to set alarms so you don’t miss them. You can use it to display your Google Photos and it works with other smart home devices you might own, like Philips Hue lights or a Nest Hello video doorbell.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Zdb7nW" target="_self">Buy Lenovo Smart Clock at Best Buy - $80</a></p><h3>Google Nest Hub</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/b1f846c0-80e0-11eb-bf7b-504ba67220ca" alt="Google Nest Hub" data-uuid="412a71ca-84d5-3630-8a1a-ecf5cc9e14c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>As mentioned, the Lenovo Smart Clock is really more of , well, a clock than a smart display. If you do want more of a typical smart display, the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/zagYZ7" target="_self">Google Nest Hub</a> is a much better bet. It has all of the features of the Lenovo Smart Clock and then some. The screen is sharp and colorful, making it great for displaying photographs and for watching videos. The on-screen controls are also a lot more intuitive, with shortcuts to your smart home devices and your favorite YouTube videos.</p><p>The sunrise alarm on the Nest Hub is also more customizable. You can have the screen gradually brighten just like the Smart Clock, but you can also have it so that a soothing “pre-alarm” sound plays as the sunrise alarm begins. If you have smart lights installed, you can have those lights gradually brighten as well. Last but not least, you can adjust the sunrise alarm window anywhere from five to 30 minutes.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/zagYZ7" target="_self">Buy Google Nest Hub at Best Buy - $90</a></p><h3>Amazon Echo Show 5</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/eb56b550-80e0-11eb-abf7-8764b59e7a99" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5" data-uuid="d72f3dca-cf58-3fc9-bd38-93b9c38b5868"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you happen to use other Amazon products like Ring cameras or Alexa-powered microwave ovens, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bVlf12" target="_self">Echo Show 5</a> might be a better choice. The screen is bright and colorful, it has a stylish streamlined design, and it can display photographs just like the Nest Hub. It can also play videos from sources such as Hulu and Amazon Prime Video, and it has a built-in browser for surfing the web. Unlike the Nest Hub, the Echo Show 5 does have a camera, which might be disconcerting if you don’t want a camera by your bedside. At the same time, this does mean the Echo Show 5 is capable of video calls, which the Nest Hub is not.</p><p>The Echo Show 5 works nicely as an alarm clock, with several clock faces and the ability to tap the top of it to hit snooze. There’s a sunrise alarm feature as well, which slowly brightens the display 15 minutes before the set time. Unfortunately, the sunrise feature on the Echo Show is a bit more limited than its rivals, as it only works when the alarm is set between 4am and 9 am. But if that works for you and you’re an Alexa fan, the Echo Show 5 is worth considering.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bVlf12" target="_self">Buy Echo Show 5 at Amazon - $65</a></p><h2>Other smart light choices</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f77897f0-80df-11eb-bfdb-c04d82e87368" alt="Casper Glow" data-uuid="207d6d90-5c11-380a-aef1-075d020fe5c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h3>Casper Glow</h3><p>The <a href="https://casper.com/glow-light/" target="_self">Casper Glow</a> is a unique lighting device that can be programmed via a companion app to brighten at specific times just like a sunrise clock, except, well, there’s no clock at all. Plus, there aren’t any speakers, so it can’t play alarm sounds either. Instead, it’s really more of a portable smart lamp. It can also be used as a late-night reading light before bed. (It’ll gradually dim over 30 minutes.)</p><p>Yet, the Glow does have several innovative features that make it stand out. The Glow is highly portable, and can be held easily in one hand. Turning it on or off is a matter of flipping it over. You can twist it clockwise or counterclockwise to adjust its brightness. At night you can lift it, give it a shake, and it’ll emit a soft glow that’s bright enough to guide you through a dark hallway. If you have two Casper Glow lights, you can have them synchronized to turn on or off at the same time. And, since it runs on rechargeable batteries, you can use it as emergency lights in the event of a blackout.</p><p>The Glow is probably not a good choice if you need more than just a bright light to wake you up. But If you already have an existing alarm clock, or you just prefer using your phone for the alarm, the Glow could be a nice addition to your nightstand.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://casper.com/glow-light/" target="_self">Buy Glow Light at Casper - $130</a></p><h3>Philips Hue smart lights</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f8694ea0-80e1-11eb-bffd-3f162d43b37f" alt="Philips Hue" data-uuid="84a723c0-dc00-3a81-8c41-21d2fb8d36da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Philips</div></figure><p></p><p>Programmable smart lights like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kDBAeB" target="_self">Philips Hue bulbs</a> are another way to help you sleep and wake up a little more easily. Plus, certain white and color ambiance lights offer color temperatures that mimic natural light, which help you sleep more naturally. You can then set up routines within the companion app that will either slowly turn on the lights in the morning or gradually turn them off at night. Of course, the Philips Hue lights can be used in other lighting scenarios too; you can have them automatically come on at night or when you’re out of the house. Plus, Hue bulbs are compatible with nearly every smart assistant out there, so turning on or off the lights is as easy as telling Google, Alexa or Siri to do so.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3kDBAeB" target="_self">Buy Philips Hue smart lights set at Amazon - $180</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-lights-for-your-bedroom-better-sleep-150059710.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4cb47d75-8702-41a2-ac78-36b6debeba6f</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:30:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615377235</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T11:54:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/171ad970-80df-11eb-b75b-138ecfe1da1e" width="2396" height="1534" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/171ad970-80df-11eb-b75b-138ecfe1da1e" width="2396" height="1534" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Philips]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Philips SmartSleep]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Philips SmartSleep]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peloton Sessions let you schedule smaller classes with friends]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Peloton has witnessed a massive uplift during the pandemic as homebound fitness enthusiasts jumped on its bikes and treadmills for their daily exercise fix. Along the way, it has had to address <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-100-million-delivery-delays-120340091.html" target="_self">delivery delays</a>, pushed out a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-plus-tread-plus-123651887.html" target="_self">cheaper tread</a> and kept the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-stacked-classes-150006236.html" target="_self">software updates</a> coming. Its latest addition is a fully-fledged version of the fleeting Sessions feature it launched in beta late last year to get you working out with a smaller pool of members. Compared to a cluttered leaderboard of thousands, the bijou live cycling or running classes aim to offer a more refined, intimate experience and could push you to be more physical.</p><p>While the beta was built around on-demand classes that refreshed every five minutes, you can now also schedule Sessions from within the Peloton iOS app, including rides and runs that last upwards of 20 minutes. Just pick a class, choose a date and time, and invite friends to join by sharing links to your Session via your fave messaging app or email.

Notably, if none of your friends have a Peloton bike or tread, you can still attend the smaller, on-demand Sessions and maybe make some buddies for your own future classes.&nbsp;</p><p>When it first landed, a lot of people wrote off Peloton as a fad for a dedicated, and affluent, fitness fanbase. Having shrugged off that image, with help from the pandemic, it&#39;s interesting to see it returning to its roots by giving members the ability to create their own smaller groups, or cults.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/peloton-sessions-schedule-classes-friends-150025576.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e6b4267-3419-41ee-a9dd-d7d2933f7bee</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615377419</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T11:57:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4818e280-8196-11eb-b6bb-895de30575ee" width="879" height="475" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4818e280-8196-11eb-b6bb-895de30575ee" width="879" height="475" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple wants you to 'follow' podcasts rather than subscribe]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you notice a change of language the next time you add a series in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-collections-kids-common-sense-media-152042399.html" target="_self">Apple Podcasts</a>, you won&#39;t be alone. <a href="https://podnews.net/update/follow-not-subscribe" target="_self"><em>Podnews</em></a> and <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/09/apple-adopting-the-word-follow-for-podcasts-as-users-associate-subscribe-with-paid-content/" target="_self"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> report that Apple is changing the option to &quot;subscribe&quot; to a podcast to &quot;follow&quot; as of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-public-beta-watch-unlock-111019009.html" target="_self">iOS 14.5</a> and its iPadOS counterpart While Apple hasn&#39;t explained the change (we&#39;ve asked Apple for comment), it&#39;s likely a simple matter of perception. &quot;Subscribe&quot; implies that you&#39;re paying a recurring cost, and that might put off new listeners who might not realize most podcasts are free.</p><p>Nearly half of people who don&#39;t listen to podcasts think it will cost money, Edison Research&#39;s Tom Webster <a href="https://tomwebster.substack.com/p/subscription-confusion-and-the-state" target="_self">found</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple isn&#39;t first to use &quot;follow&quot; language.

The Podcasts app is one of the most-used podcasts clients on the planet, if partly because it&#39;s the default app on iOS. A new turn of phrase could easily change behavior for many people. And remember, the very concept of podcasting is tied to Apple — the name comes from the days when you&#39;d <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005-06-28-itunes-4-9-with-podcasting-available-for-download-still-no.html" target="_self">load your iPod</a> with new episodes.

If that&#39;s the case, the company might need to clearly differentiate between free and paid shows. A seemingly simple change like this could be laying the groundwork for much, much more.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-follow-ios-14-5-143544059.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27d1a9fd-87fd-4a35-8bba-ff3610291d02</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:35:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615386952</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T14:36:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/bdfb6290-2852-11eb-baff-2fcbd4883ed9" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/bdfb6290-2852-11eb-baff-2fcbd4883ed9" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[stockcam via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[London, UK - July 31, 2018: The buttons of the podcast app Podcasts, surrounded by WhatsApp, Facebook, Snapchat and other apps on the screen of an iPhone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Podcasts , WhatsApp, Facebook and other Apps on iPhone screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Fortnite’ will kick off its new season with a unique solo mission]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Fortnite </em>players are accustomed to being thrust into massive season-ending events that bring together hordes of players to witness an epic set piece.

Today marks another major native release as Photoshop has officially come out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/photoshop-apple-silicon-beta-175200218.html" target="_self">beta</a> packing quicker speeds for many tasks. Adobe says the changes should be immediately noticeable from the time you launch the native app, with the splash screen vanishing in an instant. Overall, the new Mac app can run tasks up to 1.5x faster than previous generation systems. In general, that should apply when opening and saving files, running filters and compute-heavy operations like &quot;content-aware fill&quot; and &quot;select subject.&quot;</p><p>However, some of Photoshop&#39;s latest features have yet to make the jump as Adobe wanted to get the native app out as quickly as possible. So, you&#39;ll have to wait for things like &quot;invite to edit cloud documents&quot; and &quot;preset syncing&quot; — or you can switch back to Rosetta 2 emulation if you can make do without them. Adobe has been quick to embrace Apple&#39;s latest Macs having previously released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-premiere-pro-beta-m1-macs-194405849.html" target="_self">Premiere Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-lightroom-arm-m1-macs-windows-140044076.html" target="_self">Lightroom</a> apps for the new range.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with the new M1 app, Adobe is also releasing an update for Photoshop on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-photoshop-on-ipad-now-available.html" target="_self">iPad</a> that packs two new features. They include cloud documents version history, which lets you browse and revert back to older files that were auto-saved in the past 60 days, and the ability to download cloud documents locally so you can work on files offline. The same feature also lets you free up space on your iPad by making a document online only.</p><p>In addition, Adobe is adding its &quot;super resolution&quot; feature to the Camera Raw plugin in Photoshop. By tapping into your graphics card, the machine learning-powered software lets you scale up an image without losing out on quality. Super resolution will also be available on Lightroom and Lightroom Classic soon. Adobe has been sprinkling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/photoshop-desktop-ipad-update-artificial-intelligence-130024695.html" target="_self">AI-enhanced</a> features throughout Photoshop including a tool that lets you spruce up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-photoshop-premiere-elements-2021-features-145621547.html" target="_self">landscape images</a>, neural filters that mimic art styles and a sky replacement option.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-releases-a-faster-native-photoshop-app-for-apples-m-1-macs-140031036.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">edf0164a-276d-4562-a8e4-8cb7a1e9b488</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615360568</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T07:16:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/7d42f410-80c3-11eb-bf77-f19ceb3a9226" width="1950" height="1366" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/7d42f410-80c3-11eb-bf77-f19ceb3a9226" width="1950" height="1366" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe Photoshop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Photoshop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC shrinks its VR Tracker, debuts new face-tracking accessory]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HTC is today launching its third-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-16-htc-vive-tracker-hands-on.html" target="_self">Vive Tracker</a>, which is significantly smaller in size and weight than its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-20-htc-slips-out-upgraded-vive-tracker.html" target="_self">immediate predecessor</a>. The Vive Tracker 3.0 is around 33 percent smaller than the 2018 model, and 15 percent lighter, with a footprint roughly 10 centimeters, or four inches, smaller. These quality-of-life size reductions mean that the device is much easier to strap to your body, or an accessory, something very onerous on the bulky older models. Oh, and it now uses USB-C.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/79a3f420-7ccd-11eb-bffb-36b3c88cd9f8" alt="Still of the HTC Vive Tracker 3.0 alongside some Vive Tracker (2018) models and some Vive Controllers which looks nice and arty." data-uuid="6e34b5e8-517b-3e55-83e6-eef0aa650268"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Despite the smaller body, the company says that the device will last up to 75 percent longer on a single charge, pushing the quoted battery life close to seven hours. HTC has made the point that the smaller trackers should make it easier to strap them to wrists and ankles for full-body tracking in VR. Compared to testing the bigger version in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rezzil-player-football-training-vr-173507235.html" target="_self"><em>Rezzil Player 21</em></a> a few weeks back, the improvement is significant. But HTC has said that there is no compromise in the tracking precision compared to its older siblings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/b5e31f00-7cce-11eb-bfad-5fc52366701e" alt="Image of HTC&#39;s Vive Tracker 3.0 sat on a table, exposing its USB-C side." data-uuid="161b5a48-05a0-3aec-96aa-08ad28836b09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>There should be no complaints about backwards compatibility between the new trackers and the older hardware. The company says that it’ll easily integrate with SteamVR 1.0 and 2.0, and remains compatible with any accessories you already own that use the pogo pin connectors. The HTC Vive Tracker 3.0 is available from today in both the US and Europe, priced at $129 / €139, both from Vive’s own site, as well as Amazon and other participating retailers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/afc72950-7cd7-11eb-9b7b-c97e625527f6" alt="Concept image of HTC&#39;s Vive Facial Tracker as shown on a rendered individual." data-uuid="9e068e5a-cda5-3853-9b7e-84a2e5bc5c86"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>At the same time, HTC is also launching the new Vive Facial tracker, which “seamlessly tracks 38 facial movements across the lips, jaw, teeth, tongue, chin and cheeks.” The idea being to enable people in VR to project their own avatar with an accurate version of their own face, tracked in real time. The system uses an IR illuminator connected to two cameras that monitor (presumably similar to how FaceID works) the motion of your mouth.</p><p>The company says that it is both a new tool for gamers and developers, but also a way to “build momentum” for future methods of storytelling. It could also come in handy for enterprise users who need to monitor facial feedback during product testing, as well as in medical situations. Plus, it may offer cheap and cheerful motion-capture for filmmakers who can’t afford to shell out for pricier, more comprehensive methods. And this, too is available to buy from today, from HTC’s website.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-vr-tracker-3-0-2021-smaller-longer-battery-life-140018054.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ba0d698-35be-40d7-9e0f-462064703a81</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 14:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615366962</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T09:02:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bc727df0-7c2b-11eb-adfa-2b8dc194f832" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bc727df0-7c2b-11eb-adfa-2b8dc194f832" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the HTC Vive Tracker 3.0, new for 2021 with a significantly smaller footprint than its predecessor from 2018.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Tracker 3.0]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to organize your desk at home]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More people are working from home than ever before, which has led some to level up their WFH environments with new gear, new accessories and yes, new furniture. But if you want to make your home office a more functional space, you should try to keep it neat and clutter-free as well. Here are a few recommendations from our staff that will help you organize your desk and hopefully be more productive as a result.</p><h2>Monitor risers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8cd206a0-80e6-11eb-b37d-4bf60fd3a691" alt="Amazon Basics monitor riser" data-uuid="43d3cc21-616b-36c1-8de9-8f2abb89dfb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>We suggested getting an external monitor in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/work-from-home-essentials-irl-124500348.html" target="_self">previous WFH guide</a>, too, and for good reason. It seriously increases your screen real estate and is oftentimes easier on the eyes. However, not all monitors are height adjustable and they do take up quite a bit of desk space. A monitor stand or riser is a way to resolve that. A simple yet effective one is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3uNcFdc" target="_self">Amazon Basics model</a>, which has stackable legs for your desired height (up to 4-⅞ inches) plus an 11-inch wide storage space underneath to store your laptop or other knick knacks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If, on the other hand, you want something a little more stylish, this <a href="https://amzn.to/3rgoaYz" target="_self">bamboo monitor stand</a> from Stellar Importers is a particularly attractive one. It comes with compartments designed to fit your phone, coffee mug, stationary, notepads and more. There are also well-placed cut-outs to help manage your cords and cables. The legs attach together magnetically so it’s super easy to assemble. We should note that the height isn’t adjustable, but in my experience its 3.5-inch range was enough to raise our monitor to eye level. This particular model also works well as a laptop stand thanks to three holes designed for optimal heat ventilation.</p><p>If you really don’t want a monitor on your desk at all, consider a monitor arm. This is an especially good choice if you’re restless and need to change your monitor position frequently. One of our favorites is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html%3F&amp;xcust=CCT-SC-WFH-Fully" target="_self">Jarvis monitor arm by Fully</a>, which features a 360-degree swivel.

Hunching your shoulders to look at your screen is harmful for your posture, which can lead to back, neck and arm pain if you’re not careful. Instead, you’ll want your screen to be at eye level, and if you don’t have an external monitor, that means elevating your laptop with a stand. This has the added benefit of giving you more desk space as well.</p><p>We particularly recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bfNeJK" target="_self">Rain Design iLevel2</a>. The height is easily adjustable thanks to a front slider, and its tilted design is also great for keeping your laptop cool. A slightly more affordable option is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bVjTDq" target="_self">Amazon Basics Laptop Stand</a>, and though it has a fixed height, there’s a cable organizer in the back that helps keep wires tucked away.</p><p>If you do own an external monitor but don’t have a lot of extra space, we recommend a vertical stand. <a href="https://amzn.to/3qdvJOh" target="_self">This one from Omoton</a> can hold your closed laptop upright, which goes a long way in keeping your desk organized. It has an adjustable width varying from 0.55 to 2.71 inches, which should fit most laptops. The stand itself is made from scratch-resistant anodized aluminum alloy and has a wide, heavy base that will prevent your laptop from tipping over.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bfNeJK" target="_self">Buy Rain Design iLevel 2 at Amazon $51</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bVjTDq" target="_self">Buy Amazon Basics laptop stand at Amazon - $22</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qdvJOh" target="_self">Buy Omoton vertical stand at Amazon - $22</a></p><h2>Laptop dock</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/43e405f0-80e7-11eb-bf46-9dfddd10fa68" alt="CalDigit TS3 Plus" data-uuid="e1677c6f-6abe-3d80-9ec3-86c242b64574"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CalDigit</div></figure><p>Most laptops only have a limited number of ports, which could mean juggling multiple cables and cords. With a dedicated laptop docking station like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3sM0BHq" target="_self">CalDigit TS3 Plus</a>, however, you might never have to do that again. By attaching your laptop to the TS3 Plus, one Thunderbolt 3 port can turn into 15. That includes six USB ports (one USB-A and one USB-C), Gigabit Ethernet, an SD card slot, optical audio, a 3.5mm jack, a DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3 port. It offers up to 87 watts of power to charge your laptop and you can connect up to two 4K monitors via DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3.

If you have a phone without wireless charging, we recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bWqk9g" target="_self">Lamicall stand</a>, as it has a feeder hole for the charger cord on the back. The stand is made from a high-quality aluminum alloy and the cradle can be tilted back and forth for different viewing angles. If you like, you can position your phone horizontally to watch videos.</p><p>If you do have a phone with wireless charging, we strongly recommend using a wireless charger so you don’t have to mess around with pesky cords. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3kKuTHD" target="_self">Anker PowerWave Stand</a> is a good option as it supports 10W high-speed charging with the latest Samsung Galaxy handsets and 5W charging with the iPhone 12. We especially like how affordable it is ($16 as of this writing), though keep in mind that you need to supply your own power brick.</p><p>If you want to charge an iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch all at once, consider a multi-device charger. One of our favorites is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3qeKIrh" target="_self">Mophie 3-in-1 wireless charging stand</a>, thanks to its compact form factor. We like that it has a small divot that was designed perfectly to hold an AirPods case so that there’s no risk of misalignment. Another excellent choice is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fchargers%2Fpowered-wireless-charging-3-in-1-dock.950-000015.html&amp;xcust=CCT-SW-WFH-Logi" target="_self">Logitech Powered 3-in-1 Dock</a>, which could potentially be great for couples or those of you who own two handsets. That’s because the flat surface area for the AirPods case can also be used to charge a second phone.</p><p>One way to really save some space is to get a lamp with a wireless charger built into the base.

For those locked into Apple&#39;s ecosystem, there&#39;s the added benefit of quick pairing that lets you connect rapidly and switch easily between your MacBook, iPhone and iPad.

The latest series is dubbed ROG Phone 5 (skipping the &quot;4&quot; due to tetraphobia; you obviously don&#39;t want to associate gaming with death), and while it may appear to merely don some minor cosmetic changes, the innards have been completely revamped for better heat dissipation, weight distribution and audio performance. As a bonus, there&#39;s also a Pro model plus a limited edition ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, with the latter boasting a whopping 18GB of RAM.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5cbdb8c8-a208-4c23-a783-942e56d8bd66"/><p>Let&#39;s get the basics out of the way first. In addition to the processor, all three models share the same 6.78-inch Samsung E4 AMOLED display, which packs the same 144Hz refresh rate as before (so Nubia wins this round with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">165Hz</a>), but with a taller 2,448 x 1,080 resolution and a slightly faster 300Hz touch sampling rate — giving you an edge over other gamers in terms of responsiveness and accuracy. For those who are wondering, ASUS says there are now <a href="https://zentalk.asus.com/en/discussion/36042/rog-phone-3-list-of-games-supporting-above-60-fps-gameplay" target="_self">over 200 games</a> that support a 144Hz refresh rate, with titles including <em>Rockman X Dive</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Shadowgun Legends</em> and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS claims this screen is also 23 percent brighter (up to 800 nits across the entire panel), while pushing the dimmest setting to five nits with minimal distortion — the latter making a notable difference in the dark areas in videos. It&#39;s also rated with a wide 111-percent DCI-P3 gamut, 150.89-percent sRGB gamut, Delta-E of &lt;1 accuracy and HDR10+ support. And yes, there&#39;s still an optical in-display fingerprint reader here.</p><p>As much as I enjoy the display improvements, it wasn&#39;t until I started a game of <em>PUBG</em> that I noticed this screen has rounder corners than before, which cut off some info and buttons. Luckily, I could go into the game&#39;s graphics settings and tweak the &quot;non-standard screens&quot; parameter, but this may become a problem for other titles that lack such an option.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b0-8190-11eb-9ffd-3ecb282bec63" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="758531ad-4105-3d5c-a453-8e3a9e3c526b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another less obvious but notable upgrade here is the ultrasonic shoulder trigger feature. The new AirTrigger 5 buttons pack more sensors (nine instead of seven) into the same space for improved sensitivity and accuracy, and they&#39;re now placed closer to the edges to accommodate smaller hands. Like before, each AirTrigger support swipe gestures; slide gestures (both horizontal and vertical); continuous trigger (long press to simulate multiple clicks); and dual partitioning, giving you a wide range of customizable options. Though personally, I find that the good old default mode is already sufficient for my first-person shooters.</p><p>While most smartphones feature an L-shaped logic board with the processor placed near the top, ASUS found a way to place the Snapdragon 888 right in the middle of the ROG Phone 5 — far away from both hands when in landscape mode. This is mainly thanks to MMT (Middle Middle Tab) battery technology, which features a higher energy density, thus allowing for a split cell design without sacrificing the generous 6,000mAh total battery capacity. As a bonus, the two cells also offer better weight distribution and thermal control — up to 7 degrees Celsius lower battery temperature when using 30W charging, and up to 3 degrees Celsius lower when using 65W (as bundled with the ROG Phone 5), according to ASUS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278290-8190-11eb-9feb-1059fbbb859a" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="f6794b74-f611-3290-9391-c9df87690fd5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>This new internal layout, along with the taller body, thinner display panel, new side-mounted port and lack of an external 5G modem (thanks to the Snapdragon 888), allowed ASUS to squeeze extra space into the ROG Phone 5&#39;s front-facing stereo speakers. These have the same 1.2cc chamber space each, thus allowing for a symmetrical audio performance as well as improved richness (the ROG Phone 3 actually had a smaller speaker chamber on one side). On top of that, the new Cirrus Logic CS35L45 mono amp driving each seven-magnet 12x16mm speaker is apparently 21 percent more powerful than before. (It&#39;s also worth noting that the ROG Phone 5 still has quad-mic noise cancellation.)</p><p>Hardware alone doesn&#39;t complete the puzzle, though. Following the impressive results on the ROG Phone 3, ASUS continued its partnership with Dirac for audio tuning on the ROG Phone 5. The Swedish audio specialist has since come up with a dedicated solution for smartphones, which apparently resulted in more accurate calibrations for dampening distortion, enhancing the perceived bass, widening the soundstage and more on this new gaming phone. ASUS even tapped into Dirac&#39;s MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output) technologies — previously reserved for luxury cars only — to co-optimize both speakers as one system for a better overall acoustical response.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278291-8190-11eb-bbdd-100eb11ddfb6" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 3 vs ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="591cc7de-aa8f-3c4a-bdb7-48234c46e9e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>In a quick comparison with the ROG Phone 3 and the ROG Phone 5, the audio improvement was noticeable. In the rainy Tokyo scene where Natasha found Hawkeye in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, everything sounded shallower on the older phone, with the tinny rainfall noise dominating the dialog and music. The ROG Phone 5, on the other hand, sounded louder, richer and deeper. The difference was rather surprising, given how impressed I already was with the ROG Phone 3. Then I realized I could enable a &quot;cinema&quot; option in the AudioWizard&#39;s new &quot;scenario effect&quot; setting, which further boosted the perceived bass.</p><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t forgotten headphone users who still prefer the good old 3.5mm jack. The ROG Phone 5 has gained an ESS Sabre ES9280AC Pro Quad DAC, which can apparently deliver a &quot;best-in-class&quot; signal-to-noise ratio of 130 dB, and can also drive headphones with slightly higher impedance (over 50 ohm) using 2Vrms output. This should pair well with the newly released ROG Cetra II Core earbuds, which offer a seemingly impressive 20Hz-40kHz range. But if you want a wireless option, ASUS is also releasing the ROG Strix Go BT II today, which offers up to 45 hours of battery life along with AI noise cancellation.</p><p>As for photography, you&#39;ll also find the same set of cameras across the ROG Phone 5 series. In fact, the four shooters are identical to the ones on the ROG Phone 3. The rear trio include a 64MP f/1.8 main camera (Sony IMX686 sensor), a 13MP f/2.4 125-degree ultra-wide camera and a 5MP f/2.0 macro camera, whereas the front side features a 24MP f/2.45 selfie cam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb465530-8190-11eb-b97b-6ad487fee250" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="a6b90d66-1b63-3556-b5c1-9117de94e449"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Things get a little more interesting with the ROG Phone 5 Pro and limited ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is the small &quot;ROG Vision&quot; PMOLED color screen on the rear side, which lets you display customizable graphics for incoming calls, charging, gaming and other scenarios. With the Ultimate edition, ASUS picked a bold move by equipping it with a monochrome rear screen to go with its matte white finish. Furthermore, both models offer two additional capacitive touch areas on the rear panel, in case you still need more mappable buttons for your hardcore gaming.</p><p>Speaking of, it&#39;s worth pointing out that the updated Game Genie app here offers an &quot;Esports Mode,&quot; which enables &quot;do not disturb&quot; but disables all key mapping, macros, quick controls and more (so no AirTriggers and no rear touch panels). This may come in handy for tournament organizers who want more control over a fair game. Game Genie also now offers audio haptics to select games (namely <em>PUBG</em>), which automatically maps specific sounds like, say, shooting, to haptic feedback, and different weapons provide different feel to make the game more immersive. But again, Esports Mode disables audio haptics.</p><p>Much like the Nubia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">Red Magic 6 Pro</a> &quot;Dao&quot; edition, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate even offers a generous 18GB of LPDDR5 RAM (supplied by SK Hynix), though it shares the same 512GB UFS 3.1 storage as the 5 Pro, which packs 16GB of memory. The Ultimate edition will also come with a gift box containing a baseball cap, a towel, a deck of playing cards, badges, stickers, mask cover and more.</p><p>ASUS rarely failed us when it came to the range of accessories for the ROG Phone series, but with the ROG Phone 5, it finally decided to retire the dual-screen TwinView Dock and Mobile Desktop Dock. ASUS admitted that these two devices were simply too pricey, which was probably a hint at weak adoption.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b4-8190-11eb-9b7f-e6c43d247ae2" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="fd31d2cd-c1db-37f2-b6d2-43e72d2229ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the other hand, ASUS made a new AeroActive Cooler 5 which now blows directly at the hot spot, thanks to the repositioning of the processor. The company claims that this clip-on fan, with assistance from the vapor cooling chamber and graphite sheets on the inside, delivers up to 10 degrees Celsius lower CPU temperature, as well as up to 15 degrees Celsius lower surface temperature. Additionally, not only does this attachment still double as a kickstand, it adds two physical buttons as well. In other words, this means with the AeroActive Cooler 5, you get a total of four mappable buttons on the rear side of the Pro and Ultimate editions. Alas, if you&#39;re getting the regular ROG Phone 5, you&#39;ll have to buy this fan separately.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb2f4ac0-8190-11eb-babe-fc38cc24f7e1" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="8795f407-29a1-3248-a3d6-639898dcb665"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The ROG Phone 5 series also supports the Switch-like Kunai 3 Gamepad, so long as you have the updated version which comes with a bumper that fits the slightly longer body. Other optional accessories include the ROG Gaming Clip for attaching console controllers (for Xbox, PlayStation and Stadia), the new ROG Lighting Armor Case 3 (which utilizes the pogo pins on the redesigned side-mounted port) and the ASUS Professional Dock (for HDMI and USB expansion).</p><p>It appears that ASUS has once again delivered a well-thought-out package for mobile gamers, thanks to its engineering focus on audio performance, buttons, and cooling, with the Pro and Ultimate editions&#39; ROG Vision screen serving as the cherry on the cake. We&#39;re waiting for confirmation on a US launch for the ROG Phone 5 series, but for now, we do know that the regular version is launching this month, ranging from 799 euros (8GB RAM and 128GB storage) to 999 euros (16GB+256GB) in Europe. The Pro edition will launch in April for 1,199 euros (16GB RAM+512GB), followed by the Ultimate edition in May for 1,299 euros (18GB+512GB).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4862f7b-db59-40f8-93e6-f18523a268b0</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:23:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615398322</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T17:45:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Richard Lai/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram Lite reboot squeezes the app into a 2MB package]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is today relaunching Instagram Lite, a stripped-down version of the image-sharing app designed for users in emerging markets. Developed by Facebook’s team in Tel Aviv, the birthplace of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-08-facebook-lite-app-update.html" target="_self">Facebook Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-28-facebooks-messenger-lite-expands-to-132-more-countries.html" target="_self">Messenger Lite</a>, the app’s package size is just 2MB. The team said that the focus, like with the other launches, was on users whose smartphones lack storage capacity, processing power and reliable data. In order to reach that size, the app focuses on images, video and messaging, ditching other features and flourishes that fade into the background on the full-fat version of the app.</p><p>Instagram Lite still has the main feed, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-instagram-camera.html" target="_self">Stories</a> — the ephemeral messaging feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-instagram-added-snapchat-features-at-zuckerberg-request.html" target="_self">cribbed</a> from Snapchat — but not IG Live or Shopping. Engineering manager Gal Zellermayer said that, as well as live filters and other AR effects that wouldn’t work on low-power devices, animations have been edited down. He cited the example of the cube animation seen when swiping between different users’ Stories, a very processor and data-intensive transition that didn’t work well on older devices, which has been removed. Zellermayer added that a lot of extra compression work is handled on the server side to relieve the burden off the device itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Michelle Lourie, product manager, explained that there were a number of additional UI tweaks to better suit “new digital users.” This included ditching a trash can to represent a delete icon, in favor of an X, which testers found made more sense. In addition, Lourie said that GIFs and Stickers remain part of the app since, unlike AR filters, they were space efficient while remaining fun. Lourie added that the team is currently working on Dark Mode, a feature that users were requesting long before the app was released.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-instagram-lite-google-play.html" target="_self">first version of Instagram Lite</a> was little more than a wrapper around a web app. Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-lite-removed-ahead-of-redesign-013230379.html" target="_self">shut it down that version in May 2020</a>, and at the time said that it was working on a new version with better on-device support. This new edition has been in testing in several territories already, but is today rolling out to Google Play in 170 countries around the world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-lite-2021-relaunch-110016873.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55a31047-f2fb-4c75-8f1a-0f03daf56a7c</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615290632</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T11:50:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e8977ad0-80cb-11eb-bfff-c884b4eb02ce" width="3242" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e8977ad0-80cb-11eb-bfff-c884b4eb02ce" width="3242" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook / Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Screenshot, provided by Facebook, of Instagram Lite (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Lite (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple to invest over $1 billion in new Munich silicon facility]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is pouring over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) into a huge R&amp;D project in Munich, Germany, at the heart of which is a new European Silicon Design Center.

However, Google has announced that the &quot;messages&quot; part of that equation is about to go away. The Google Voice app now tells users that &quot;message forwarding to linked numbers will stop soon because mobile carriers have started to block those messages,&quot; according to <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/09/google-voice-wont-forward-text-messages-to-outside-numbers-much-longer/" target="_self"><em>Android Police</em></a><em>. </em></p><p>Call forwarding is not affected, so you&#39;ll still be able to use your Google Voice number to ring all your other phones. However, you&#39;ll only be able to see your Google Voice messages on the Google Voice app located on your phone or the web. That could cause issues for notifications, as some wearables and other devices don&#39;t support notifications directly from Google Voice, as <em>Android Police</em> noted.
