Now, researchers from UT Southwestern Medical Center have developed a sleeping bag that that could prevent or reduce those problems by effectively sucking fluid out of astronauts&#39; heads.</p><p>More than half of NASA astronauts that went to the International Space Station (ISS) for more than six months have developed vision problems to varying degrees. In one case, astronaut John Philips returned from a six month stint about the ISS in 2005 with his vision reduced from 20/20 to 20/100, as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59591301.amp"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For multi-year trips to Mars, for example, this could become an issue. &quot;It would be a disaster if astronauts had such severe impairments that they couldn&#39;t see what they&#39;re doing and it compromised the mission,&quot; lead researcher Dr. Benjamin Levine told the <em>BBC</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/972c0a80-5bef-11ec-bdff-83ccb7d93fe2" style="height:393;width:700;" alt="Optical Disc Edema SANS" data-uuid="0e3b4900-cf7d-35fa-866c-627ac105eff0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">UT Southwestern/NASA</div></figure><p>Fluids tend to accumulate in the head when you sleep, but on Earth, gravity pulls them back down into the body when you get up. In the low gravity of space, though, more than a half gallon of fluid collects in the head. That in turn applies pressure to the eyeball, causing flattening that can lead to vision impairment — a disorder called&nbsp;spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANS. (Dr. Levine discovered SANS by flying cancer patients aboard zero-G parabolic flights. They still had ports in their heads to receive chemotherapy, which gave researchers an access point to measure pressure within their brains.)</p><p>To combat SANS, researchers collaborated with outdoor gear manufacturer REI to develop a sleeping bag that fits around the waist, enclosing the lower body. A vacuum cleaner-like suction device is then activated that draws fluid toward the feet, preventing it from accumulating in the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Around a dozen people volunteered to test the technology, and the results were positive. Some questions need to be answered before NASA brings the technology aboard the ISS, including the optimal amount of time astronauts should spend in the sleeping bag each day. They also need to determine if every astronaut should use one, or just those at risk of developing SANS.</p><p>Still, Dr. Levine is hopeful that SANS will no longer be an issue by the time NASA is ready to go to Mars. &quot;This is perhaps one of the most mission-critical medical issues that has been discovered in the last decade for the space program,&quot; he said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-sleeping-bag-prevent-eyeball-squashing-083937316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">409f3352-7c6d-4c26-a123-1ab4ce84932a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:39:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639385851</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T08:58:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/320fda10-5be9-11ec-b6b2-7befd752b8a9" width="1548" height="860" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/320fda10-5be9-11ec-b6b2-7befd752b8a9" width="1548" height="860" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UT Southwestern]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA's new sleeping bags could prevent eyeball 'squashing' on the ISS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA's new sleeping bags could prevent eyeball 'squashing' on the ISS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag drops to $25 for Amazon Prime members at Woot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s now that much more affordable to scoop up an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a> and track your keys or bag from your iPhone.

This wasn&#39;t a large-scale campaign like the one that defaced the Twitter accounts of Joe Biden, Elon Musk and other major figures, though. It&#39;s chiefly concerning that someone breached Modi&#39;s account in the first place — world leaders are expected to have strict security, and Twitter even has a system for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-project-guardian-vip-safety-220809710.html">protecting high-profile users</a> against attacks.

The large screen (even on the 41mm model) makes a big difference for readability, not to mention control. Dust resistance and a more crack-resistant screen will help for venturing outdoors, while the fast charging should keep you going if sleep tracking or a lengthy workout has chewed through the battery. Add a strong app ecosystem and solid health features and the Series 7 is strong both as a first-time watch and a solid upgrade for anyone coming from Series 4 or earlier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few catches beyond the usual iPhone requirement.

There&#39;s not much to tempt an upgrade if you&#39;re using a Series 5 or 6. Beyond that, however, t&#39;s an easy choice at this reduced price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-amazon-sale-blue-152250870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea89a436-f126-4ac5-95bd-651ba6a1d0f5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 15:22:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639322573</ingested><modified>2021-12-12T15:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76090360-5b56-11ec-9bfc-2bdd6f1d296d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76090360-5b56-11ec-9bfc-2bdd6f1d296d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 in blue with Sport Band]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 in blue with Sport Band]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon explains outage that took out a large chunk of the internet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has explained the Web Services outage that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-web-services-outage-dec-2021-173157290.html">knocked parts of the internet offline</a> for several hours on December 7th — and promised more clarity if this happens in the future.

On day one of the IEDM conference in San Francisco, the two companies unveiled a new design for stacking transistors vertically on a chip. With current processors and SoCs, transistors lie flat on the surface of the silicon, and then electric current flows from side-to-side. By contrast, Vertical Transport Field Effect Transistors (VTFET) sit perpendicular to one another and current flows vertically.</p><p>According to IBM and Samsung, this design has two advantages. First, it will allow them to bypass many performance limitations to extend Moore’s Law beyond IBM&#39;s current nanosheet technology. More importantly, the design leads to less wasted energy thanks to greater current flow. They estimate VTFET will lead to processors that are either twice as fast or use 85 percent less power than chips designed with FinFET transistors. IBM and Samsung claim the process may one day allow for phones that go a full week on a single charge. They say it could also make certain energy-intensive tasks, including cryptomining, more power-efficient and therefore less impactful on the environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to commercialize the design. They’re not the only companies attempting to push beyond the 1-nanometer barrier. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">In July</a>, Intel said it aims to finalize the design for angstrom-scale chips by 2024. The company plans to accomplish the feat using its new “Intel 20A” node and RibbonFET transistors.</p><p><strong>Update 12/12 12:20PM ET:</strong> IBM has clarified that VTFET will help it expand beyond its existing nanosheet technology, not necessarily to chips denser than 1nm. It also noted that you can have extreme improvements in performance or battery life, but not both. We&#39;ve updated the article accordingly and apologize for the error.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ibm-samsung-vtfet-semiconductor-design-announcement-213018254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4ce969b-e2a9-4437-909a-d854c4e9f8c2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 21:30:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639329807</ingested><modified>2021-12-12T17:23:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f8474310-5aab-11ec-b3ad-af9a91eaf8df" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f8474310-5aab-11ec-b3ad-af9a91eaf8df" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IBM / Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VTFET transistors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VTFET transistors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft fixed a Teams bug that prevented 911 calls on Android]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll want to quickly update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-personal-use-features-154524176.html">Microsoft Teams</a> if you&#39;re an Android phone user. <a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63">According</a> to former <em>XDA</em> editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman, Microsoft has fixed a Teams bug that led to failed 911 calls on devices using Android 10 or later. Reddit user KitchenPicture5849 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/">discovered</a> that having Teams installed, but not signed in, would prevent emergency calls from going through. The phone would say a call was active and ring once, but never properly initiate the connection — call logs would show nothing.</p><p>Rahman and friend Kuba Wojciechowski pinpointed the cause. While all Android calling apps will try to create a PhoneAccount class instance in the operating system, Teams was creating instances every time a user started the app &quot;cold&quot; — that increased the chances of a sorting problem that stopped calls from going through.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google talked to the Reddit user and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/">revealed</a> that both the company and Microsoft were planning fixes. In addition to the Microsoft patch, Google is delivering an Android platform update on January 4th that should address its side of the problem. You can delete and reinstall Teams to clear any excess PhoneAccount instances, and staying logged in should prevent any mishaps.</p><p>Google said this only affected a &quot;small number of devices.&quot; The issue, however, was the severity. This could have blocked someone from making a life-saving call through no fault of their own.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-911-call-android-bug-fix-201139753.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9366d23a-1369-48ff-9037-35831b046d97</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 20:11:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639253503</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T20:11:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[releon8211 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emergency and urgency, dialing 911 on smartphone screen.

Wheeler and Christina D. Rosan. Reprinted with permission from University of California Press.</p><hr><p>While this book is about reimagining sustainable cities, we pause here to connect sustainable cities with the larger national and international context in terms of spatial inequality. We live in a world that is deeply interconnected. If we want sustainable cities, we need to work on reducing spatial disparities between cities and rural areas, and between different regions worldwide. Linkages between communities need to be recognized, and resources shared and equalized. Situations must be ended in which some regions exploit others by giving them the unwanted by-products of production, such as pollution, waste, and labor exploitation, while simultaneously moving resources and profits from poor regions to rich ones.</p><p>In and around the towns of eastern Kentucky, where Stephen Wheeler’s ancestral family is from, people of English and Scottish descent lived for many generations as self-sufficient farming families. That way of life changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Better roads, electricity, and telecommunications connected Appalachia with the rest of the world. Urban job opportunities lured away the young. Farming families became part of the cash economy and acquired new desires for processed foods, appliances, motor vehicles, and personal accessories. But hill farms didn’t generate enough cash to buy such things, especially with rising federal subsidies for agribusiness in other parts of the country. So the people of eastern Kentucky became designated as poor and came to see themselves that way.</p><p>Environmental problems grew as well. Giant bulldozers scraped away hilltops and extracted coal, adding this region to the long list of others worldwide suffering from the “resource curse.” Runoff from coal mining poisoned wells and polluted waterways. Coal jobs left as quickly as they had come, leaving many even poorer.</p><p>A new, more globalized retail economy brought first Kmart and then Walmart, putting family-owned stores out of business. Fast-food outlets proliferated. But the new service economy jobs didn’t pay much. To make better money some people began growing marijuana in hard-to-reach locations in the hills. Drug use, alcoholism, and obesity spread. Fundamentalist religion gained adherents and combined with Fox News (starting in the 1990s) to promote reactionary political values. A region that had been Democratic until the late twentieth century now helped elect US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell in turn played one of the largest roles in thwarting progressive legislation from Barack Obama’s administration, supporting Donald Trump’s presidency and fueling the rise of populism in the US.</p><p>If this tale of decline were one isolated example, it might not matter much. But spatial inequality persists and spreads worldwide. Some left-behind communities are rural. Others are urban. Entire countries are stuck in poverty due to the legacy of military or economic colonization. Spatial inequality is a core challenge to the development of more sustainable cities. Every community needs to be able to thrive, not just certain favored ones within a highly unequal global system. Instead of engaging in a zero-sum approach to development, with winners and losers, communities need to support one another so that all improve their quality of life and sustainability.</p><p>The so-called winners of today’s global economic competition have their own problems. At the other end of the spectrum from Appalachia is Silicon Valley. This forty-mile corridor in the San Francisco Bay Area is an economic dynamo envied the world over. Covered by orchards and agricultural fields in the 1950s, this beautiful area was known as “Valley of Heart’s Desire.” Now no orchards remain, and the region is a congested sprawl of poorly connected office parks, subdivisions, malls, and commercial strips. Incomes are high, but the price of a home is nearly five times that in the US as a whole. Many residents cannot afford housing near their jobs and so endure lengthy commutes or are housing insecure. Social inequality, traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions expanded greatly during the past fifty years, reducing the quality of life in the region and contributing to global warming.</p><p>The Silicon Valley ethic of “move fast and break things” has created dynamic companies, unprecedented technology, and great wealth for a few. But the new gig economy pioneered there often operates at the expense of workers and the environment. It often produces an enormous concentration of wealth that comes from the exploitation of others. One study found that one-fifth of San Francisco Uber and Lyft drivers earned virtually nothing when their full expenses, including things such as health insurance, were accounted for. The tech industry has also been heavily criticized for sexual harassment during the MeToo movement and racism during the Black Lives Matter movement. The combination of individualism, predatory capitalism, toxic masculinity, and lack of concern for the common good that Silicon Valley represents works strongly against a sustainable and equitable future.</p><p>Similar problems of unequal development exist in other successful urban areas worldwide, including Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Bangalore, Singapore, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Tel Aviv. Though among the world’s economic success stories, on many dimensions of sustainability they are failures. The growing core-periphery disparities that produce left-behind communities and “sacrifice zones” on the one hand and wealthy but unsustainable and highly unequal job centers on the other are at the heart of recent global development patterns.</p><p>Let us imagine instead a world where we are not content with the concentration of wealth and opportunity in a small number of global cities; where all communities have affordable housing and provide a decent quality of life; where cities meet the needs of people locally and regionally but do not drain wealth from other parts of the world; where no areas are left behind in the transition to a green economy, their populations increasingly alienated, despairing, and vulnerable to unscrupulous politicians and warlords; and where social dimensions of sustainability are well served everywhere.</p><h2>Sources of the Problem</h2><p>Today’s spatial inequity problems have long historical roots, illuminated by literature in fields such as economic geography, sociology, and environmental history. One starting point is physical geography. Some parts of the world have more fertile soils than others, more abundant mineral resources, more useful plant, animal, and fish species, and/or more benign topography and climate. Other places have been strategically well located to serve as trading centers and market towns or have been easy to defend against attack. Such communities have been able to accumulate modest amounts of wealth and power. The “chessboard” of geographical wealth is constantly shifting and with global warming is likely to shift in even greater ways in the future.</p><p>However, in other cases spatial inequities have resulted from military, religious, cultural, political, and/or economic systems that further centralize power and wealth. Typically these have drained resources from the periphery to the core of empires. Many parts of the world still suffer the legacy of colonization. Local traditions and cultures were disrupted, peoples were exploited, racism was institutionalized, ecosystems were harmed, and corrupt, colonizer-friendly governments were installed following independence. The damage has been so profound and long-lasting in many places that reparations may be appropriate. The need for climate justice may likewise call for reparations and repayments.</p><p>Twentieth-century economic development philosophies exacerbated spatial inequality on the assumption that economic globalization was to everyone’s long-term benefit. Various versions of “growth pole” theory, originating in the 1950s, sought to focus business development in particular geographical locales within countries on the assumption that this would leverage economic development in other parts. Such wider-scale progress was rare; growth poles instead often channeled resources to local elites, created isolated business enclaves, and harmed the environment.</p><p>The municipal economic development practice of chasing branches of multinational corporations has likewise undermined prospects for a more stable long-term economic base in cities worldwide. This “race to the bottom” competition leads suburbs to compete to host the newest shopping mall, central cities to compete for corporate headquarters, and states or countries to lower their environmental and labor standards to attract multinational corporations. However, the resulting businesses often don’t provide the expected number of jobs, pay the decent wages promised, or stay more than a few years. As Margaret Dewar has pointed out in her well-titled article “Why State and Local Economic Development Programs Cause So Little Economic Development,” politicians have an incentive in the short term to appear to be generating jobs by attracting well-known companies but little incentive to take into account long-term economic or environmental sustainabilIty. A recent example of the extreme lengths that municipalities will go to in order to attract development can be seen in the global competition for the second Amazon headquarters.</p><p>The Bretton Woods framework of post–World War II development assistance only deepened global spatial disparities, creating what economist Andres Gunder Frank termed “the development of underdevelopment.” Agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned funds to developing countries for megaprojects that created wealth for elites but left others poor and displaced, while countries accumulated enormous debt to lenders in the Global North. National governments focused on what sustainability-oriented NGOs refer to as “extreme infrastructure.” These dams, power plants, industrial zones, and large-scale agricultural projects sought to jump-start an export-oriented form of economic development that was often environmentally harmful and funneled capital created by Third World labor and resources into First World bank accounts.</p><p>Yet another source of disparities has been the structural adjustment policies that neoliberal governments in wealthy nations insisted upon as a condition for international assistance during the past forty years. These require developing countries to take actions such as cutting social programs, privatizing public assets such as utilities and railroads, reducing barriers to foreign investment, and lowering taxes on the wealthy. The effect has been to make life harder for the poor while enriching elites and international corporations. It is increasingly clear that structural adjustment policies need to be discontinued and policies that promote spatial equity put in their place.</p><p>Finally, the offshoring of manufacturing from wealthy nations to low-cost and less regulated parts of the globe during the past half century has had complex effects on spatial disparities. It has impoverished the US Rust Belt as well as the British Midlands, leading to the growth of right-wing populism in both places. Meanwhile, it has helped fuel the rise of megacities and megaregions in the developing world, leading to massive internal migration and expanding economic disparities between those urban areas and the countryside. Undoubtedly, these global economic shifts have improved quality of life for many. But they have harmed others, disrupted societies, contributed to the climate crisis, and widened the gulf between rich and poor communities (figure 7).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1f1fc860-56c7-11ec-bffd-16e17bfa19fa" alt="Figure 7" data-uuid="b580afab-a76e-34ee-aff7-402996e8b255"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">UC Press</div></figure><p>Although spatial disparities are still expanding in many places, there is hope for the rebirth of left-behind cities and regions. Manchester, UK, the first industrial powerhouse in Europe, lost much of its manufacturing in the middle of the twentieth century but has since rebuilt itself by focusing on culture, education, physical regeneration, and its geographical role as a transportation center. The US steel capital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after losing 350,000 industrial jobs in the 1980s, reinvented itself as a center of renewable energy, health care, and education. Even the long-declining hulk of Detroit, one of the most hollowed-out American cities, is showing signs of a turnaround. Examples such as these indicate the possibility for left-behind places to rebound. But all of these cities had assets to start with, including a strong identity and an active elite that led revitalization efforts. Other communities and regions don’t have such advantages. And the pervasive problems associated with spatial inequality affect wealthy as well as declining places, necessitating holistic and imaginative solutions at higher levels of governance.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-reimagining-sustainable-cities-christina-rosan-stephen-wheeler-uc-press-163019173.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253db024-1dd1-4cbc-a6fd-ff57dd237c7b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638829375</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T22:23:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/df350100-56cd-11ec-a97f-4e512f1fee0d" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff225fd0-56cd-11ec-87ff-1b44c22b3958" width="3000" height="1897" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Tama via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BOONEVILLE, KY - APRIL 20:  A man walks beneath an American flag at the Owsley County Saddle Club trail ride on April 20, 2012 in Booneville, Kentucky.

Log4j happens to be a popular and widely used logging library, and even popular cloud services like Steam and iCloud, as well as apps like Amazon, Twitter and <em>Minecraft</em> are reportedly vulnerable to attacks exploiting Log4Shell.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/the-critical-log4shell-zero-day-affects-a-whos-who-of-big-cloud-services/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, it first came to light after <em>Minecraft</em> websites started reporting about a vulnerability allowing hackers to execute malicious code in the game.

As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828003/peloton-bike-satc-and-just-like-that">reports</a>, Peloton has raced to defend its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-living-with-peloton-bike.html">signature Bike</a> after a scene in the first episode of HBO Max&#39;s <em>Sex and the City</em> revival, <em>And Just Like That</em>, featured the cycling hardware in a less-than-flattering way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scene depicted Carrie&#39;s husband Mr. Big, played by Chris Noth, dying of a heart attack soon after he finished a 45-minute Peloton class on the company&#39;s Bike (with real instructor Jess King in a fictional role, we&#39;d add). Peloton is worried viewers might think the Bike was responsible, and not just because the show might hurt sales — the company&#39;s stock price plunged between December 9th and December 10th, and it didn&#39;t get much better by the weekend.</p><p>In a statement, Peloton health and wellness advisor Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum argued that Mr. Big&#39;s death likely occurred despite the Bike, not because of it. Big lived an &quot;extravagant lifestyle&quot; that included drinking, smoking and a steak-filled diet, and he&#39;d even had a cardiac incident in <em>SATC</em>&#39;s sixth season. If anything, Dr. Steinbaum suggested, Big&#39;s riding might have &quot;helped delay&quot; his heart attack.</p><p>Peloton also said it was caught off-guard. Spokesperson Denise Kelly <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/peloton-big-just-like-that-hbo">told</a><em>BuzzFeed News</em> the company was aware an HBO-purchased Bike would be in the episode and that King would portray an instructor, but &quot;confidentiality reasons&quot; prevented it from learning about the tragic plot point until the <em>And Just Like That</em> premiere.</p><p>This likely won&#39;t significantly dent Peloton&#39;s sales figures.

CEO Pete Parsons said his hope was the studio’s efforts would set an example for the wider gaming industry. At the time, it appeared the announcement was a proactive move by Bungie, but now it seems the studio was responding to some of its own inner turmoil.</p><p>In response to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><ins>story from </ins><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a> reporting on years of systematic sexism and workplace harassment at the studio, Parsons has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50895">published an apology letter</a>. “I am not here to refute or to challenge the experiences we&#39;re seeing shared today by people who have graced our studio with their time and talent,” he says. “Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologize personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feels a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He says over the last several years Bungie has made “significant” changes to foster a better workplace. At the top of that list, he notes the studio has removed “bad actors” irrespective of their “tenure, seniority or interpersonal relationships.”</p><div id="3ff7c5da43c74468bad77fb5ca4cde22"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you so, so much to everyone who spoke to me and trusted me with your stories for this piece. To readers, please remember that with articles like this, there is often so, so much more beneath the surface that couldn&#39;t be included for any number of reasons.</p>— Rebekah Valentine (@duckvalentine) <a href="https://twitter.com/duckvalentine/status/1469351594462363652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>That’s not something it appears was true of Bungie in the past. In one section of the report, <em>IGN</em> recounts the story of a <em>Destiny</em> narrative lead who threw a chair at a window because “he felt others were ruining his creative vision of the game.” That individual reportedly stayed at the company for several years after that incident until he left and was later hired to do contract work for <em>Destiny 2</em>. The report also notes many employees wrote letters to Parsons begging for him to intervene in a variety of workplace issues. He reportedly never responded to those pleas.</p><p>As things stand today, Parsons says he believes employees whose behavior warranted removal were either fired or they no longer work at Bungie. If new information comes to light, Parsons pledged Bungie would investigate those reports “with integrity.”</p><p>After reiterating the studio’s commitment to the reforms it announced in September, Parson’s letter turns to Bungie’s recent hiring efforts. Over the past five years, he says the number of employees who identify as women or as someone from an underrepresented community has increased to 20.5 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively. In 2021, 31 and 23 percent of the studio’s hires were employees who identified as part of those two groups. What he doesn’t mention is where those numbers were previously. Without historical data, it’s impossible to know how much better Bungie has become at hiring more diverse candidates.</p><p>While the sexual harassment scandal at Activision Blizzard has dominated headlines in recent months, today’s <em>IGN</em> report underscores that there are toxic workplaces across the gaming industry. Harassment and management protecting abusers: these are issues that keep coming up year after year. They&#39;re not exclusive to one company because many of them have been built in the same way, and it will take a concerted effort to undo those cultures.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-responds-ign-report-211235404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">12b67c0c-fc37-4b4f-8d94-06faecc085d3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:12:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639170780</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T21:13:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/3371d680-beb4-11e9-bffd-5994cda4b1a3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/3371d680-beb4-11e9-bffd-5994cda4b1a3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bungie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Destiny 2 'Titan' prepares to fight some of the game's Hive enemies.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter reportedly knew Spaces could be misused due to a lack of moderation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter%20spaces/"><ins>Twitter Spaces</ins></a> debuted earlier this year, hundreds of people have reportedly joined live audio discussions led by &quot;Taliban supporters, white nationalists, and anti-vaccine activists sowing coronavirus misinformation.&quot; According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>,</em> Twitter didn&#39;t have the moderation tools necessary to combat bullying, calls for violence and hate speech in Spaces before rolling out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/clubhouse/"><ins>Clubhouse</ins></a> competitor — despite executives knowing that would likely lead to misuse.</p><p>Spaces doesn&#39;t have human moderators or tech that can monitor audio in real-time. It&#39;s much more difficult to automatically review audio than text. So far, Twitter has relied on the community to report Spaces they think violates the company&#39;s rules. However, if a host uses the feature as a soapbox to share transphobic, racist or otherwise bigoted views (<a href="https://katelynburns.medium.com/twitter-spaces-are-a-damn-mess-5b5707698827"><ins>as has reportedly happened</ins></a>), and their audience agrees with them, it seems unlikely that a listener will report the discussion to Twitter&#39;s safety team.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the report, Twitter&#39;s technology helped some of these discussions to go viral. Because these Spaces were amassing large audiences, the systems understood them to be popular, and promoted them to more users. Twitter spokesperson Viviana Wiewall told the <em>Post </em>the supposed bug has been dealt with.</p><p>“Ensuring people’s safety and encouraging healthy conversations, while helping hosts and listeners to control their experience, have been key priorities since the beginning of [Spaces’] development,” Wiewall told the publication. Wiewall noted that the company is &quot;exploring avenues&quot; in terms of moderating Spaces in real-time, &quot;but it’s not something that we have available at this time.”</p><p>The spokesperson noted that Twitter did have some protections in place. It can scan the titles of Spaces to look for keywords that raise red flags, but modified spellings can ensure problematic words bypass the filters.</p><p>Twitter employees are said to have raised concerns about unmoderated live audio rooms, but some of those who suggested the company should slow down and work on technology to improve safety were reportedly dismissed from or left out of meetings. Leaders forged ahead with the Spaces feature anyway, at least in part to appease investors by speeding up product development and generating more revenue.</p><p>Since August, hosts who meet certain criteria have been able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ticketed-spaces-launching-224353538.html"><ins>charge for access to Spaces</ins></a>, with Twitter taking a cut. The company has been chasing other revenue streams beyond advertising, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-revue-newsletter-service-124341255.html"><ins>newsletters</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html"><ins>Twitter Blue premium subscription</ins></a>. There have been issues with some of those products too. The Tip Jar feature, through which users can send payments to each other as tips, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tip-jar-201442453.html"><ins>exposed some tippers&#39; home addresses</ins></a> via certain types of PayPal transactions.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Twitter for comment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-knew-spaces-would-be-misused-due-to-lack-of-moderation-201501061.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">67048150-8478-40c0-9b77-a67594843255</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 20:15:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639166351</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T19:59:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0c075350-beca-11eb-9bff-1ad572e04754" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0c075350-beca-11eb-9bff-1ad572e04754" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/03/12: In this photo illustration the Twitter Spaces page is seen on a smartphone screen  with a Twitter logo in the background.
