The option, which is only available in the US for now, <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tidal-launches-their-first-ever-free-music-tier-two-enhanced-hifi-tiers-and-new-ways-to-get-artists-paid-301426774.html"><ins>includes access</ins></a> to Tidal&#39;s entire library of 80 million songs as well as playlists. The service <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1460972114253602824"><ins>noted on Twitter</ins></a> that it&#39;s introducing the free tier to &quot;remain competitive&quot; with its rivals, eight months after Square <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-buys-control-of-tidal-142318706.html"><ins>bought a majority stake</ins></a> in the company. Tidal says the plan is rolling out on Android and &quot;will be available on all devices in the coming days.&quot;</p><p>There are some trade-offs beyond occasional ads, of course. The audio quality tops out at 160 kbps, there&#39;s no offline listening option and it doesn&#39;t appear that you&#39;ll have unlimited skips. The later feature is mentioned explicitly as part of the revamped $10/month Tidal HiFi plan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tidal <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1460972116006903809"><ins>says</ins></a> users on that plan can now listen to music in HiFi quality — up to 1,411 kbps. There are no ads and you&#39;ll gain access to more than 350,000 videos. Users can listen to music in HiFi quality on connected devices through Tidal Connect, and they&#39;ll be able to track and share what they&#39;re listening to via a new activity feed.</p><p>In addition, there&#39;s a $20/month HiFi Plus plan. It includes everything from the HiFi tier, as well as master-quality audio at up to 9,216 kbps. The plan also offers immersive, spatial audio formats, such as Dolby Atmos and Sony 360 Reality Audio, and early access to upcoming features. Both HiFi plans are available in all countries in which Tidal operates.</p><p>What&#39;s more, the HiFi Plus tier has a couple of new features centered around artists. One of those is direct-to-artist payments, which Tidal is rolling out today. Every month, 10 percent of a HiFi Plus user&#39;s subscription fees (i.e. $2) will go to the artist they listen to the most. That&#39;s on top of regular streaming royalties. It&#39;s another way for users to support their favorite artists.</p><div id="d8f055f523eb45c19a8edf32c7e3f56e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fan-Centered Royalties will not be aggregated.<br><br>Instead, royalties will go to the artists that TIDAL users actually stream, so fans can directly support the artists they love. (What a concept, right?)<br><br>This will start in January 2022 at our HiFi Plus tier. <a href="https://t.co/Q8z4fleYOc">pic.twitter.com/Q8z4fleYOc</a></p>— TIDAL (@TIDAL) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1460972135212593155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Starting in January, Tidal will roll out a revamped artist payment system called fan-centered royalties. Every time a HiFi Plus user listens to one of their songs, they&#39;ll receive a <a href="https://twitter.com/TIDAL/status/1460972128753307649"><ins>&quot;significantly higher&quot;</ins></a> per-stream payment than other music streaming services&#39; payouts. Apple Music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-streaming-payment-rate-spotify-162320807.html">pays</a> a penny per stream, while artists have long been <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/musicians-organize-global-protests-at-spotify-offices/">asking Spotify</a> for a similar rate.</p><p>Tidal says &quot;royalties attributed to HiFi Plus subscribers will not be aggregated.&quot; Payments will be tied to each individual user&#39;s listening activity, but only on that tier. HiFi Plus users will be able to see how those payments are divvied up through their activity feed.</p><p>In addition to revamping the payment model, Tidal is aiming to ensure &quot;quick and seamless&quot; payouts to artists around the world. It&#39;s working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/square/"><ins>Square</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cash%20app/"><ins>Cash App</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/paypal/"><ins>PayPal</ins></a> to facilitate those.</p><p>These are bold, but perhaps necessary moves by Tidal as it aims to become more competitive with larger music streaming services. Tidal was one of the first major proponents of lossless audio, but as rivals started offering that option at no extra cost, it more or less had to bring that option to the $10/month plan.</p><p>Apple Music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html"><ins>added</ins></a> lossless and Dolby Atmos spatial audio features in June. Amazon Music Unlimited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-unlimited-plans-hd-streaming-included-135249659.html"><ins>dropped the premium fee</ins></a> for HD and Ultra HD streaming in May. It too offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-spatial-audio-headphones-ios-android-dolby-atmos-sony-360-reality-audio-142301483.html"><ins>spatial audio</ins></a> as part of the regular plan.</p><p>Meanwhile, many of Tidal&#39;s rivals have long offered ad-supported free streaming options, including Spotify, Amazon Music, Deezer and YouTube Music. At the opposite end of the scale, Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html"><ins>announced plans</ins></a> in February to roll out a CD-quality audio plan, also called HiFi, in select markets at some point this year. It has yet to do so.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tidal-free-streaming-plan-artist-paymetns-royalties-153606001.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c244d04-d092-4cd0-adf9-b5ef81752451</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 15:36:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637163369</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T15:36:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e4d34d0-47ba-11ec-bfe9-6cbd4dea05c1" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e4d34d0-47ba-11ec-bfe9-6cbd4dea05c1" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BARCELONA, CATALONIA, SPAIN - 2021/07/26: In this photo illustration a Tidal app seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background.

The company is <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-announces-self-service-repair/">launching</a> a Self Service Repair program that will let you repair products yourself using official Apple parts and tools. The option will be available in the US in early 2022 (later that year for other countries) and will initially give the resources to fix an iPhone 12 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a> (you&#39;re looking at <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928">iFixit&#39;s</a> iPhone 13 Pro teardown above), with M1-based Macs eligible soon afterward.</p><p>The first &quot;phase&quot; of Self Service Repair will focus on core components like the battery, camera and display, with other parts eligible later. Apple will ask customers to review a repair manual and then order relevant parts through a Self Service Repair Online Store. The company didn&#39;t say how much parts would cost, but did offer credit to customers who return used parts for recycling.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not surprisingly, Apple stressed that the program was meant for people with experience repairing electronics. The &quot;vast majority&quot; of people were still better off getting service from professionals, whether at Apple stores or authorized providers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company didn&#39;t say what prompted the openness to self servicing. However, it may be a matter of government pressure. The White House, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html">the Federal Trade Commission</a> and multiple states have backed right-to-repair measures that could force Apple and others to allow customer maintenance. This theoretically heads off some of the major complaints by letting any skilled person fix a device themselves without resorting to unofficial parts.</p><p>There are lingering questions. Will the part pricing be competitive enough to make Self Service Repair a viable alternative to professional help? And will Apple tweak its product designs to make these repairs more practical? While there are signs of these tweaks between a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-face-id-third-party-replacement-215624361.html">relaxed policy</a> on iPhone 13 display repairs and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ifixit-2021-mac-book-pro-teardown-163032306.html">easy-to-remove MacBook Pro batteries</a>, we wouldn&#39;t expect simple fixes in the near future.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d38a9958-5ce7-4d09-abbb-974b9638708d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 14:21:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637160180</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T14:43:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b44a09d0-47b0-11ec-9567-0b9e9bf6adc8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b44a09d0-47b0-11ec-9567-0b9e9bf6adc8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iFixit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro teardown by iFixit]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro teardown by iFixit]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Streamlabs accused of copying material for its console streaming platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Streamlabs is coming under fire for material used to launch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamlabs-studio-xbox-livestreams-160021753.html">Xbox streaming platform</a> — and beyond. As <em>Eurogamer</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-17-streamlabs-under-fire-from-rival-software-owners-and-streamers-following-release-of-new-product">reports</a>, rivals have accused the company of copying web material, naming schemes and possibly functionality. Lightstream, for instance, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightstream/status/1460709404609757185">noted</a> that the initial website for Streamlabs Studio was extremely similar to its own, including (as streamer iamBrandon <a href="https://twitter.com/iamBrandonTV/status/1460717382368993286">discovered</a>) the user reviews. Streamlabs said this was an &quot;error&quot; that put placeholder text on a live site, and the planned copy was now in place.</p><p>That&#39;s only the start of the accusations, however. OBS <a href="https://twitter.com/OBSProject/status/1460782968633499651">complained</a> that Streamlabs used OBS as part of its broadcasting software name (Streamlabs OBS, or SLOBS) despite being asked not to. While Streamlabs has technically honored the terms of the GPL license used for OBS, it allegedly &quot;disregarded the spirit&quot; of open source software. Elgato, meanwhile, even <a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1460722403261046789">implied</a> Streamlabs&#39; Stream Deck was borrowing at least the name (if not features) from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-28-elgato-stream-deck-xl-ios-app-streaming.html">Stream Deck Mobile app</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Streamlabs for comment. However, the plagiarism accusations have already led to a significant backlash.  Top streamers <a href="https://twitter.com/imane/status/1460818399374692355">Pokimane</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hasanthehun/status/1460815355543130116">Hasanabi</a> have both threatened to stop using Streamlabs&#39; products (and in Pokimane&#39;s case, remove her name from the platform) if it didn&#39;t address the situation. Simply put, Streamlabs might lose some of its best-known customers if it doesn&#39;t act quickly.</p><div id="1fccf36319d8481f87f61686d67df70a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🤡 Hey, can I copy your homework?<br><br>▽   Yeah, just change it up a bit so it’s not obvious you copied.<br><br>🤡 Bet. <a href="https://t.co/xODY5uDZeP">pic.twitter.com/xODY5uDZeP</a></p>— Lightstream (@Lightstream) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightstream/status/1460709404609757185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-accused-of-copying-lightstream-obs-140742760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6167c391-a5d8-4153-bdb1-f8a8e794c72e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 14:07:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637158065</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T14:07:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/293a7780-47ab-11ec-9dfd-5e32c288d98d" width="675" height="461" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/293a7780-47ab-11ec-9dfd-5e32c288d98d" width="675" height="461" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Streamlabs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Streamlabs Studio and OBS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Streamlabs Studio and OBS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber's $10 One subscription gives you VIP access to rides and deliveries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Uber is taking another shot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-30-uber-launches-ride-pass-subscription.html">at subscriptions</a>, and this latest attempt might make sense if you&#39;re as interested in deluxe treatment as you are discounts.

It&#39;s noticeably smaller and also doesn&#39;t require a bridge like the previous one did since it connects to WiFi. August&#39;s mobile app will walk you through the setup process, and during that you&#39;ll be forced to turn on two-factor authentication. We appreciate that this is an unskippable step as it adds another layer of security to the device. You&#39;re also getting Bluetooth encryption plus AES 128-bit and TLS encryption with this smart lock, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The setup process is pretty straightforward, and once installed, you&#39;ll be able to use your smartphone to remotely lock or unlock your door. If and when you want to let a friend or family member inside your home when you&#39;re not there, you can do the unlocking yourself or send them secure virtual keys that will let them get inside. The app also shows you an activity feed, so you can see who opened your door and when. We also like the Auto-Lock and DoorSense features for peace of mind: the former automatically secures the lock when you shut the door and the latter tells you if your door is securely closed, so you don&#39;t have to rush back home if you don&#39;t remember shutting it.</p><p>And just because you&#39;ve made the move to a smart lock doesn&#39;t mean your old-school keys are worthless. You can still use your keys to get inside, which will come in handy on the rare occasions when the smart lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries need replacing.

Like the phone itself, it’s not the most exciting update. The 2022 Moto G Power once again features a 5,000mAh battery Motorola claims can provide up to three days of continuous use. This time around, the company has gone with a 6.5-inch display that features a panel with 720p resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate.</p><p>New to this latest model is a tweaked triple camera array highlighted by a 50-megapixel main camera. Motorola claims low-light performance is significantly improved. The 2022 Moto G Power trades the ultra-wide camera of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-motorola-moto-g-power-moto-g-stylus-hands-on.html">predecessor</a> for a 2-megapixel macro camera and 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, there’s an 8-megapixel with an f/2.0 aperture lens. With Motorola’s dual capture feature, you can record video footage with both the front- and rear-facing cameras.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Internally, the phone features an octa-core MediaTek Helio G37 processor supported by 4GB of RAM. Motorola will sell the phone in two storage configurations, with the 64GB model costing $200 unlocked, while the 128GB variant will set you back $250. A MicroSD slot allows you to add up to 512GB of additional storage.</p><p>Other notable features include IP52 waterproofing and a fingerprint sensor for authentication. One thing the Moto G Power doesn’t include is a NFC chip, so you won’t be able to use it with Google Pay to make mobile payments. One other thing to note is the Moto G Power is limited to 10W charging. That means it will take a while to charge its 5,000mAh battery. The phone will ship with Android 11 out of the box.</p><p>In the US, the Moto G Power will go on sale “in the coming months” at Republic Wireless and T-Mobile’s Metro flanker brand. At a later date, Verizon, Boost Mobile, Xfinity Mobile, AT&amp;T, Cricket, USCellular and Google Fi will also carry the device, with unlocked availability at Best Buy and Amazon to follow sometime in 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2022-motorola-moto-g-power-140010550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc30dbe5-2f34-4263-a3a6-019f81dde411</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 14:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637099004</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T21:43:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/51749680-4725-11ec-baff-71d39b11c2de" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/51749680-4725-11ec-baff-71d39b11c2de" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Motorola]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Moto G Power]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Moto G Power]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's colorful new HomePod mini is on sale for the first time ahead of Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple expanded its HomePod mini lineup with three new colors back in October, and now we&#39;re seeing the first discount on those new options, plus the classics.

That&#39;s $5 off their normal price and, while a modest discount, it&#39;s one of the best we&#39;ve seen on the tiny smart speaker.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/32bMqDB" id="74cc502239784594b6382330acde7d42" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy HomePod mini at B&amp;H - $95</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod mini</a> is Apple&#39;s main smart speaker now that it discontinued the original HomePod (although the company still supports that speaker with software updates). It&#39;s also the most compact of the $100 smart speakers, its competition being the Amazon Echo and the Google Nest Audio. It&#39;s a capable device and, like other Apple accessories, arguably best for those who have many Apple products and use services like Apple Music. In addition to its cute design, we liked it for its easy setup and Siri&#39;s prowess with music controls. The voice assistant promptly plays Apple Music albums, playlists and tracks when you ask it too, and you can AirPlay audio from almost any other app (like Spotify and Prime Music) to the HomePod mini. So while the speaker is most convenient for Apple Music subscribers, anyone can use it pretty easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite being the smallest of the $100 smart speakers, the HomePod mini holds its own against the Nest Audio when it comes to sound quality. Mids and highs are clear and the speaker&#39;s passive radiators help deliver forceful bass. Its &quot;computational audio&quot; feature helps out by adjusting sound accordingly based on what type of music you&#39;re playing. You can also pair two HomePod minis together for stereo sound, and they sound even better this way.</p><p>However, if you&#39;re looking for the best sounding device at $100, we recommend going for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#39;s Echo" href="https://amzn.to/3DFCe4d">Amazon&#39;s Echo</a> instead. Siri also lags a bit behind Amazon&#39;s Alexa and the Google Assistant when it comes to smart home control — it&#39;s harder to find HomeKit-supported gadgets than it is to find devices that support either Amazon&#39;s or Google&#39;s voice assistants. But those are relatively small cons if you&#39;re looking for a solid, compact smart speaker, particularly one that shines with Apple Music and works well with Apple devices. And if you&#39;ve been holding out for one of the latest colors, we expect B&amp;H&#39;s sale to be one of the better options this holiday shopping season.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Volition’s chief creative officer, Jim Boone, has announced that the title will now land on August 23rd, 2022, back from the original launch date of February 25th.</p><p>In a <a href="https://saintsrow.com/news/saints-update-from-jim-boone">statement</a>, Boone reiterated that the title wasn’t undergoing any wholesale changes and that the team had adapted well to the adversities imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. But that the original deadline did not offer the team enough time to “do our vision justice,” especially given the “size and scope” of the new game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Boone added that the extra time will be spent ensuring that the game gets further “fine tuning,” with an emphasis on improving the title’s “overall quality and polish.” He closed the statement by saying that the finished product will have “been worth the wait,” especially given how much is riding on the launch.</p><p><em>Saints Row</em> (2022) is a clean-sheet reboot of the series, which had lain dormant since 2015’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-19-saints-row-gat-out-of-hell-review-shout-at-the-devil.html"><em>Gat out of Hell</em></a> (we’re <em>still</em> not counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_Mayhem"><em>Agents of Mayhem</em></a>). Earlier this year, Volition’s developers said that while there was a degree of affection for the series, narratively it had run its course — especially since the last title was a rock musical-themed journey into hell.</p><p>Consequently the new title is set in the Four Corners region of the US, with the player character flanked by a trio of new associates. And whereas the previous series spun out into parodying whatever genre was en vogue at the time, this new title is focused more explicitly on the material concerns of its crew. Except, you know, it’s a <em>Saints Row</em> game, so put your tongue in your cheek while you&#39;re doing all of this.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/saints-row-2022-reboot-delayed-until-august-105526445.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73140461-e381-4447-a3a1-7b33fc625c0e</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 10:55:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637146187</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T10:49:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89d72630-05b9-11ec-bfb4-fcbcdb6e022e" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89d72630-05b9-11ec-bfb4-fcbcdb6e022e" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Deep Silver / Volition]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Images of the Saints Row cast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Saints Row' cast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag 4-pack falls to $88 at Woot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re looking to pick up multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">Apple AirTags</a>, now might be a good time.

It notified Amazon UK customers in an email about the change, blaming the high fees Visa charges for credit card transactions. Buyers can at least continue using their Visa credit cards throughout the holidays, but after that, they&#39;d have to switch to a Visa debit card or another credit card like a Mastercard or an AMEX.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The cost of accepting card payments continues to be an obstacle for businesses striving to provide the best prices for customers. These costs should be going down over time with technological advancements, but instead they continue to stay high or even rise. As a result of Visa’s continued high cost of payments, we regret that Amazon.co.uk will no longer accept UK-issued Visa credit cards as of 19 January, 2022. Customers can continue to use all debit cards (including Visa debit cards) and other non-Visa credit cards to shop on Amazon.co.uk. With the rapidly changing payments landscape around the world, we will continue innovating on behalf of customers to add and promote faster, cheaper, and more inclusive payment options to our stores across the globe.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a Visa spokesperson said the company is disappointed that &quot;Amazon is threatening to restrict consumer choice in the future.&quot; They added: &quot;When consumer choice is limited, nobody wins.&quot; They also said that Visa is working towards a resolution with the e-commerce giant so that cardholders can keep on using their UK-issued Visa credit cards on the website &quot;without Amazon-imposed restrictions come January 2022.&quot; It&#39;s worth noting that Amazon has a much better relationship with other credit card providers. The e-commerce giant currently has a partnership <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Platinum-Mastercard/dp/B01LSOD0ZI">with Mastercard</a> for consumer credit cards and with AMEX for <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amazon-Business-American-Express-Card/dp/B07V3GD6PJ">business cards</a> in the UK.</p><p>The companies may be engaging in a public war in an effort to get better terms from each other. Amazon has been putting pressure on the credit card brand over the past few months and started <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/consumer/amazon-to-introduce-05-surcharge-for-visa-credit-card-transactions-in-singapore">imposing</a> a 0.5 percent surcharge on Visa credit card purchases on its Singapore website on September 15th.

A group of 200 artists and 30 rights groups has penned an <a href="https://www.amazondoesntrock.com/">open letter</a> demanding the Red Rocks amphitheater, its ticketing provider AXS and AEG (AXS&#39; parent company) &quot;immediately cancel&quot; contracts to use Amazon One scanning at any venue. They also want the firms to ban all biometric surveillance at those events.</p><p>The opponents to Amazon&#39;s palm tech include figures you&#39;d recognize, such as Rage Against the Machine&#39;s Tom Morello and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-bikini-kill-on-streaming-services.html">Bikini Kill&#39;s</a> Kathleen Hanna.

They&#39;re also concerned thieves might steal info from the cloud, and see AEG as inconsistent after it condemned the use of facial recognition in 2019.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked AEG and Red Rocks operators for comment. There are no guarantees the letter will convince anyone to drop Amazon One. The tech theoretically helps get people into a venue sooner, and might reassure concertgoers nervous about physical contact while the pandemic lingers. The objectors have some support, though — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-amazon-palm-print-data-investigation-134424558.html">US senators are also worried</a> Amazon might abuse palm data.

However, the new model is the first Instax camera with a print lever and lens/film filter dials. That lets you take a picture then choose among 100 combinations of effects (including &quot;Soft Focus,&quot; &quot;Light Leak,&quot; &quot;Monochrome&quot; and &quot;Retro&quot;)  and print the image afterwards by pulling the print lever.

In fact, fans outside the US and Canada will have to wait months to be able to see the new episodes — legally, that is — if they ever get the chance at all. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/star-trek-discovery-netflix-deal-paramount-viacomcbs-1234875466/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, ViacomCBS has ended its deal with Netflix that had been in place since the series launched in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The publication says the money Netflix paid for the show&#39;s overseas rights paid for most of Discovery&#39;s hefty budget. Now that ViacomCBS has paid off the deal, it also pulled the entire show from Netflix. Apparently, it plans make the series available again to international fans in 2022 when Paramount+ goes global. The UK, Germany, Ireland, Austria and Switzerland will be among the first regions to get access to the streaming service next year. By the end of 2022, the service will be out in 45 countries, but as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-discovery-is-lost-to-most-of-the-world-days-1848069210"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> points out, that&#39;s still a tiny fraction of the 190 regions where Netflix is available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kelly Day, ViacomCBS Networks International streaming boss, told <em>Deadline</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As we rapidly expand our global streaming footprint, we are bringing more of our top titles home to ViacomCBS for Paramount+ markets around the world. We have a strong global and local content pipeline that positions us for success across our regions, and repatriating beloved series like Star Trek: Discovery for Paramount+ is another step forward as we bring fans more must-watch series worldwide.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In a tweet, the show&#39;s official account said that the fourth season will still premiere on Paramount+ on November 18th in the US. Meanwhile, it will arrive on CTV Sci-Fi Channel in Canada on the same day and will be available for streaming in the country on Crave the day after.</p><div id="21ee13327d5b4d36bfbfbdc2932c279b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uz0ReiYUMW">pic.twitter.com/uz0ReiYUMW</a></p>— Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) <a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrekOnPPlus/status/1460714366265823239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-leaves-netflix-080929478.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e2fcdb0-62eb-4ded-8512-5e2b726dcc95</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:09:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637156498</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T13:41:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f85ae950-47ab-11ec-bdaf-188091babd77" width="1600" height="1049" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f85ae950-47ab-11ec-bdaf-188091babd77" width="1600" height="1049" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Paramount+]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The captain sits on the bridge in the captain's chair in this scene from Star Trek: Discovery.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Trek: Discovery.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Porsche unveils the Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Porsche has <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-gts-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-la-auto-show-26460.html#">unveiled</a> two new options for those looking to get one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-porsche-taycan-ev-first-ride-tech.html">Taycan EVs</a>: A Taycan with the legendary GTS moniker and a third body model called the GTS Sport Turismo. Kevin Giek, VP of the Taycan model line, said the GTS &quot;is positioned above the Taycan 4S and below the Taycan Turbo derivatives, so it represents a real sweet spot in the range.&quot; As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, with the addition of these two, there are now 10 Taycan variants in all.</p><p>The luxury automaker calls the GTS version the &quot;sporty all-rounder&quot; of the line. It has a range of 504 km or 313 miles, making it the first Taycan to break the 500 km mark. The model&#39;s adaptive air suspension was specifically adapted to the GTS, and it has Black or dark details on the exterior — including the front apron, the bases of the exterior mirrors and the side window trims — as is traditional for a GTS car.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the Taycan Sport Turismo is a mix between the Cross Turismo and the sports saloon, though it doesn&#39;t have off-road elements. It has the sporty silhouette and the rearward-sloping roofline of the Taycan Cross Turismo, and its rear headroom is 45mm (around 1.7 inches) greater than the Taycan sports saloon. Both the GTS and the Sport Turismo can go from 0 to 100 kmh (62 mph) within 3.7 seconds and have a maximum speed of 250 kmh (155mph).&nbsp;</p><p>The Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo will have prices that start at EUR131,834 (US$149,000)  and EUR132,786 (US$150,000), respectively. They will both be heading to dealers in the spring of 2022, and more engine options for the Sport Turismo will follow. Porsche will also be showcasing the new EVs at the LA Auto Show, which will take place from November 19th through the 28th, so we&#39;ll hear more about the new vehicles in the coming days.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-062707716.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20cb8712-e02d-4280-8db1-6a09be223d84</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 06:27:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637156245</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T13:37:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/58e93160-47ab-11ec-adcd-4f738f1f49ef" width="1692" height="1051" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/58e93160-47ab-11ec-adcd-4f738f1f49ef" width="1692" height="1051" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A red Porsche Taycan GTS sits in an empty lot overlooking a valley with hills in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan GTS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix offers a clearer look at its top 10 rankings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html">definition of a successful show</a> has been opaque at times, to put it mildly, but the company might have just provided some meaningful transparency. The streaming service has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/new-top-10-on-netflix">launched</a> a &quot;Top 10 on Netflix&quot; <a href="https://top10.netflix.com/">website</a> that shows the charting movies and TV shows on the service, both English and non-English. You&#39;ll see both global and country-specific data to back up the rankings, including total viewing hours and the number of weeks on the chart.</p><p>You&#39;ll also find all-time stats and the list of countries where a given title is charting. Netflix even lets you download lists in Excel or TSV formats if you crave raw data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initial rankings don&#39;t provide too many surprises. The star-studded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-08-netflix-red-notice-heist-movie.html"><em>Red Notice</em></a> was by far the most popular movie worldwide based on time spent, racking up 148.7 million viewing hours in its first week. <em>Yara</em> was the most-watched non-English title with nearly 18 million views. The latest season of <em>Narcos: Mexico</em> topped the English TV list with about 50.3 million hours after two weeks, and it won&#39;t shock you to hear <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> dominated non-English TV with 42.8 million million hours and nine weeks in the top 10.</p><p>Yes, Netflix was aware its viewing metric favors longer-running movies and shows. It planned to &quot;occasionally&quot; offer specialty charts to give popular productions in certain fields (such as documentaries) their due. However, the company said it wouldn&#39;t reveal how many people have finished a given movie or series — it believed all hours were relevant, whether you were distracted (think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-netflix-and-chill-button.html">Netflix and chill</a>), rewatching a favorite show or fixating on an individual scene.</p><p>The site won&#39;t answer every question about Netflix&#39;s rankings. You may know which shows are getting the most viewing time, but you won&#39;t know just what it takes to get a renewal or sequel. Still, the potential effects are significant. Observers could better tell whether a title&#39;s viewership really matches the hype, or which countries are driving demand. And while studios are likely very aware of how their releases are faring, the site might push some to &#39;optimize&#39; their lineups to ensure consistently high rankings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-top-10-chart-transparency-213412386.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32152702-b447-4a2f-a861-935bb6e3a56e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:34:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637098455</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T21:36:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66955890-471d-11ec-b373-cf340df96139" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66955890-471d-11ec-b373-cf340df96139" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix Top 10 website]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix Top 10 website]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard workers walk out and demand CEO Bobby Kotick's resignation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Employees at Activision Blizzard are calling for the resignation of CEO Bobby Kotick following new revelations into the role he may have played in creating the toxic workplace culture that has mired the company in controversy. On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>published a comprehensive report on Kotick&#39;s handling of the sexual harassment lawsuit California&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>Department of Fair </ins></a>Employment<a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins> and Housing</ins></a> (DFEH) filed against the publisher in July.

According to documents obtained by the outlet, Kotick penned the now-infamous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-executives-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit-response-192228768.html"><ins>email</ins></a> Frances Townsend, executive vice president of corporate affairs at Activision Blizzard, sent to employees after DFEH filed its lawsuit. In that message, the company said the complaint presented &quot;a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago.&quot; The response drew the ire of many Blizzard employees, who said it was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html"><ins>abhorrent and insulting</ins></a>.&quot;</p><p>The report also provides insight into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html"><ins>recent departure of Jennifer Oneal</ins></a>. One month after her <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html"><ins>appointment</ins></a>, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader reportedly sent an email to the company&#39;s legal team in which she said she wasn&#39;t convinced Activision Blizzard would turn its culture around. Referencing a moment earlier in her career at the company, she says in the email, &quot;I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere, the report describes an episode involving Dan Bunting, one of the heads of Activision&#39;s Treyarch studio. In 2017, Bunting was reportedly accused of sexually harassing a female employee. Following an internal investigation, Activision&#39;s HR department recommended he be fired, but Kotick reportedly intervened to keep him at the company.</p><p>A spokesperson for Activision Blizzard disputed <em>The </em>Journal&#39;s reporting. The company&#39;s full statement reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>We are disappointed in the Wall Street Journal’s report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO. Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry’s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their — and our — values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick’s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.</p></blockquote><p>The company also commented on the impending walkout. &quot;We are fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment for all of our employees around the world. We support their right to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,&quot; a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard told Engadget.</p><p>Amid the unrest at Activision Blizzard, Kotick has presented himself as an ally of the studio&#39;s employees. &quot;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone-deaf,&quot; he said in an<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html"><ins> email</ins></a> he sent after the Townsend message. In that same message, he claimed he would take &quot;swift action&quot; to create a safe and inclusive working environment. When Kotick later announced the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html"><ins>zero-tolerance harassment policy</ins></a>, he said he would take a massive pay cut until Activision Blizzard&#39;s board of directors felt he had met the diversity and safety goals he outlined.</p><p>Even after today&#39;s report, it&#39;s hard to see Kotick resigning. He has been with Activision since the early 1990s, and he was the architect of the 2008 merger that created Activision Blizzard. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116006294/en/Activision-Blizzard-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Recent-Article">board of directors</a> has also said it &quot;remains confident&quot; in his leadership.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47dfec06-3247-47fa-9264-724fccf51e4d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637092494</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T19:55:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bobby Kotick, chief executive officer of Activision Blizzard, attends the annual Allen and Co.

Starting today, users over the age of 18 with more than 10,000 followers can apply to use the feature. The company introduced Badges in <a href="https://about.instagram.com/en-us/blog/announcements/supporting-creators-on-instagram">May of last year</a>. Then, in October, it expanded their availability to approximately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-expands-badges-and-commercials-130020878.html">50,000 creators</a>. Badges represent a way for Instagram creators to earn money from their fans. Users can purchase them to make themselves during livestreams. Instagram sells them in increments of $1, $2 and $5.</p><p>The company recently said it wouldn’t collect any fees on Badges until at least 2023. Down the line, the feature could help Instagram diversify its revenue beyond the advertising sales it depends on almost exclusively at the moment. More broadly, Badges could be the prelude to more perk-like monetization features making their way to the app in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-badges-us-rollout-180045149.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed93d3b0-537c-4bb6-a589-76326ec0d7aa</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636998265</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T17:44:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
