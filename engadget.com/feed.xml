Well, we did find out who was pulling the strings behind the Time Variance Authority and why, but it really served as an introduction to a villain who’s scheduled to make his next appearance in <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Loki</em> never felt like an extended prequel to well… anything. It’s been a show that’s stood largely on its own, one which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loki-disney-plus-premiere-review-160028040.html">forged</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-marvel-studios-loki-episode-two-180043690.html">unique identity</a> apart from everything else in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, including the Thor movies. After all, this isn’t the Loki we spent eight years watching on screen. This one was created in 2019 in the middle of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, a variant that so far is walking a path free of Asgard and all that pesky Avengers business.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4cd225a0-e57f-11eb-b93f-dae57671e846" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="Tom Hiddleston and Sophia Di Martino" data-uuid="3d46082e-1217-30fe-bd95-e8d433838974"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>And so <em>Loki</em> the show paved its own road as well, not really relying too much on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">knowledge of the films</a> past the first and last Avengers movies. You could walk into the series knowing as much about Loki’s fate as the variant Loki and walk away after the first season knowing just as little. The finale was interesting because for the first time, I have no idea how a Marvel show fits into the greater scheme of things. And like He Who Remains, I find that a bit exciting.</p><p>One thing that has been true of all the Marvel shows has that we’ve always generally known where they’re supposed to slot into the bigger universe. <em>Agents of SHIELD</em> was originally intended to be a way for the side stories of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to thrive but for a while it was treated as a place to dump movie leftovers. <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em> and <em>Iron Fist </em>were originally aimed toward setting up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-marvel-the-defenders-netflix-full-trailer.html"><em>The Defenders</em></a> limited series. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a> was a prequel for <em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em>, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> did character work for the next Captain America film.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eb411390-e57f-11eb-9bbb-8b779f94e35e" style="height:1608;width:3081;" alt="Tara Strong as Miss Minutes and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Renslayer" data-uuid="e13088d0-e2e0-31a0-bbf6-6589a71bb10f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But <em>Loki</em>, aside from wrapping up a loose thread from <em>Endgame</em>, doesn’t actually tie into anything, especially any upcoming projects. They don’t even name the man behind the curtain, he’s just “He Who Remains.” And he’s killed by the end of the episode, which means any time we see him from this point forward, it’s technically a different person; another cosmic iteration of the same jerk. Fans of the comics know that he’s meant to be <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/kang">Kang the Conqueror</a>, but that big reveal is yet to come — because the man we met is not a conqueror. He was a cosmic bureaucrat.</p><p>The conqueror, though hinted at in the <em>Loki</em> finale, will make his first full appearance in early 2023. He won’t remember the events shown in the <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/5bAzOD">Disney+</a> show since he wasn’t actually there, which means either the film will completely ignore all we learned here, or explain it to the audience anew. Prior knowledge of <em>Loki</em> shouldn’t and most likely won’t be necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4c361740-e580-11eb-9ffe-3f49ae979aab" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="Sophia Di Martino and Tom Hiddleston" data-uuid="e6e3494a-b84c-381e-b748-b3256fd9d5a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Which leaves season two of <em>Loki</em> free to do well, almost anything it wants. The man who seems to now be in charge of the TVA is unlikely to be even close to the same man that Scott Lang and Hope Pym will have to tangle with, since we are dealing with a multiverse of possibilities. It does throw the next Doctor Strange movie into a bit of uncertainty, since in our original non-COVID timeline that was supposed to have premiered back in May. Were we supposed to see the debut of the multiverse before we saw its origin? Or will there be some other cosmic wrench to mess things up further for the MCU? A lot of things that seemed inevitable when all these projects were originally announced have now been thrown into uncertainty.</p><p>But for now, the key takeaway from the <em>Loki</em> finale is that the series is not beholden to anything else in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It didn’t have to load up a ton of character development or make sure everything is back in place plot wise before the next film. It’s free to take its small cast of characters and fully explore their possibilities, with no worries about how it will affect the other Marvel properties. What will happen to Loki, Sylvie, Mobius, Ravonna and the rest? We can focus on their individual stories instead of fussing over what can and can’t happen.</p><p>We can no longer make predictions based on future projects in the pipeline, or contractual obligations of actors. Theories can proliferate and almost nothing is off-limits. Every step Loki and the rest take just means another multiverse to explore in shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-if-disney-plus-august-11-183845530.html"><em>What If?</em></a>. The Sacred Timeline is dead, and so are the shackles of movie continuity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fafbe022-2725-48eb-93d6-55e95c1d85e2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626363977</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T15:46:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boastful Loki, Kid Loki, Alligator Loki and Classic Loki]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Council of Lokis]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Arturia made its music-making software more accessible]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When visually impaired <a href="https://www.jasondasentinstudio.com/">music producer Jason Dasent</a> decided to buy a collection of instrument plugins from Arturia about four years ago, he did so despite his suspicion that the company’s tools wouldn’t be accessible. He was right. “At that point I couldn’t browse and use the software,” he said. “I pretty much couldn’t do anything.” He had spent some $500 on <a href="https://www.arturia.com/company/press/press-releases/arturiaannouncesvcollection5">Arturia’s V Collection 5</a>, a set of virtual instruments that included recreations of some vintage synths he wanted to use. It was cheaper than spending hundreds of thousands on actual synths, he told himself.</p><p>But because Arturia’s preset manager Analog Lab wasn’t built to accommodate the visually impaired at the time, Dasent had to drop even more cash. “I would have to hire someone to come in for maybe three days to save these presets,” he said. For between $500 and $1,000, this person would export the presets to a format that would work in Avid’s Pro Tools, which had the accessibility features Dasent needed. It was a  tedious and expensive process, he said, but even after that he could only choose presets. He couldn’t tweak cutoffs, envelopes, parameters or adjust the brightness. “I had no choice but to just stick with the presets,” he added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2019, Dasent presented at the Audio Developers Conference (ADC) in London, where he was approached by Arturia’s then director of software development, Kevin Molcard. Moldcard wanted to make Analog Lab accessible, and asked for Dasent’s help. After the company set him up with the V Collection 7 and one of its Keylab controllers, Dasent started playing around. Eventually, Dasent was introduced to Arturia product manager Pierre Pfister, who wanted to learn more about what Analog Lab was missing.</p><div id="6bc4b63a35bd46e9b53816ea8be606ed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zeGbEBjEf-M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Two months later, Dasent said, he got a call from Pfister. “I have something to show you.” What Pfister then shared with Dasent was an early version of a new accessibility toolset in Analog Lab V. “It’s as if my eyes are now open,” Dasent gushed. That kicked off a months-long back-and-forth between Dasent, Pfister and the Arturia team as they worked on the prototype, culminating in the launch of a new update today. The company is <a href="https://arturia.com/stories/jasondasent">announcing a new accessibility mode to Analog Lab V</a>, which will enable all users to turn on auditory feedback and screen reading. It also brings various “ergonomic improvements and bug fixes.”</p><p>With this new accessibility mode, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-beginner-home-music-studio-bedroom-producer-guide.html">company&#39;s Keylab controllers</a> now communicate with the Analog Lab software and a computer&#39;s text-to-speech engine. &quot;Basically, as I press a button on Keylab, or I turn a dial or change a value, it sends notifications out to the system voice, allowing me to know exactly what&#39;s on the keyboard,&quot; Dasent said in a video describing the update. Now, when he tweaks faders and encoders on the keyboard, &quot;I can know exactly what the values are as I tweak the parameters.&quot; As he turns a knob on the controller to scroll through a list of instruments, a voice reads out the name of each item he lands on.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Dasent is familiar with Arturia&#39;s devices, he has the layout of buttons and dials memorized. But he added that &quot;the layout of the keyboard is very well thought out, so it makes learning where everything is very easy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The most challenging part of getting the software accessible for visually impaired users, according to Pfister, wasn’t necessarily implementation or programming — it was figuring out how best to communicate with the system’s text-to-speech. Since a lot of music software (and many creative products in general) aren’t designed with accessibility in mind, there aren’t many best practices to pull from. Arturia almost had to start from scratch. “The hardest part was knowing what we should do and how we should make a product accessible,” Pfister said.</p><p>Once they figured it out and showed Dasent the first prototype though, the results were gratifying. “His reaction made everything worth it.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9c267650-e413-11eb-8fdd-5851d610a46e" alt="A screenshot of Arturia&#39;s Analog Lab V, with a navigation column on the left, three rows in the middle for Instruments, Types and Sound Banks.

He acknowledged that Arturia is a small company and there’s “a lot of things we don’t know.” The plan for now is to continue listening to and soliciting feedback to “identify what most of our users would like to be able to do.” Whether that means getting all of the Analog Lab program fully accessible or to make all its individual instruments accessible, Pfister said the goal is to continue improving what it’s done with Analog Lab.</p><p>Like most of the tech industry, music software developers have, until now, largely overlooked the needs of people with disabilities. In a <a href="https://blog.native-instruments.com/designing-for-the-visually-impaired-and-how-its-changing-how-software-is-made/">2019 blog post</a> for competing music company Native Instruments, UK technologist Chris Ankin said: “Historically, music software offered poor accessibility with existing screen readers.”</p><p>Even the leading digital audio workstation (DAW) Pro Tools struggled with keeping its software accessible through years of updates in the 2000s. At the time, in an effort to keep up with the latest versions of Apple’s desktop software, Avid offered newer plug-ins and features in its OS X version that those using older editions of Pro Tools did not get. The problem is, while the pre-existing Pro Tools HD (which launched in 2002) was “almost entirely accessible,” <a href="http://www.avidblogs.com/music-daw-software-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-audio-professionals/">according to audio engineer Slau Hatlyn</a> in an article on Avid’s website, the software for OS X wasn’t usable even after Apple introduced its VoiceOver screen reader in 10.4 Tiger in 2005. The only thing Hatlyn could access was the menu bar. “No other windows were readable.”</p><p>It took until Pro Tools version 8’s <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/home-page/2018/3/27/a-brief-history-of-pro-tools">launch in 2008</a> for the software to regain accessibility, a long time considering “the previous accessible version was 5.3,” according to Hatlyn. Even so, the conversation continued, with Hatlyn calling out changes that broke accessibility between versions 10 and 11.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a948480-e414-11eb-bd7b-ad910e4e04ef" alt="Arturia&#39;s KeyLab mk2 keyboards" data-uuid="a3e0a414-c14e-32d5-bddd-4f916d26a226"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>And this is one of the industry’s most widely used DAWs. While Apple’s Logic is lauded as accessible, other music software companies that build assistive technology into their products are a rarity. Brands like Ableton and Image Line don’t appear to have comprehensive tools for the visually impaired in their products Ableton Live and FL Studios, at least based on the <a href="https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=230533">comments on</a><a href="https://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?t=188683">their forums</a>. A spokesperson for Ableton highlighted a Zoom Display feature, as well as recent updates to improve contrast, reduce automatic colors and adjust grid intensity as tools in Live for visually impaired users. The spokesperson added “We’re aware that there is much more to be done here.” Image Line has yet to respond to our request for comment.</p><p>Will Butler, the vice president of company whose app, Be My Eyes, connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers, wrote a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/music-software-accessible-we-rank-best-worst-apps-will-butler">LinkedIn post</a> about the accessibility of music software. In it, Butler asked blind music producer Byron Harden to anecdotally rank the accessibility of popular music software. While Harden placed GarageBand, Pro Tools, Audacity and Logic in the top four, awarding them passing scores out of ten, Ableton Live and FL Studio came in near the bottom with one point each.</p><p>Butler also highlighted Native Instruments for its efforts. In 2019, the company expanded support for Mac’s VoiceOver, as well as Narrator and the Speech API in Windows. Prior to that, Native Instruments <a href="https://blog.native-instruments.com/how-komplete-kontrol-is-empowering-visually-impaired-musicians/">had made keyboards with</a> touch-sensitive rotary encoders and buttons with auditory feedback. With those, its software “can detect when the user’s fingers are resting on them, then give auditory feedback – synthesized speech – of the current value, and do so continuously as it’s adjusted.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="f08b1706c51d4a039032eaf9f5e3ecea" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26059fa0-e571-11eb-9e77-20d75cb541e2" alt="Music producer Jason Dasent playing on an Arturia keyboard"></section><p>That auditory feedback is one of the features Arturia is bringing to Analog Lab V that Dasent is most grateful for. “One thing they got right: quality of feedback,” he said. Say for example you load a preset. When you hit the load button in Analog Lab V, it will say “Loaded” and read out the name of the pack. Dasent said that software can sometimes offer too much feedback or use overly lengthy sentences and phrases to communicate. It would be like a sighted person having to read 20 lines of text to get one little piece of information that a single sentence could have conveyed.&nbsp;</p><p>As Pfister recalled his first call with Dasent, he was amazed and shocked by the amount of effort Dasent was willing to expend to use Arturia’s instruments. “If they are willing to put in that much effort, why don’t we do a little bit to make their life so much easier?”</p><p>Indeed, while there are frontrunners in making music software more accessible for people with disabilities, the industry as a whole could benefit from a published set of best practices. This way, they could be disseminated to smaller companies entering the space and make it easier for them to build accessible products. Ultimately, as with the development of most assistive technologies, that would benefit all users regardless of able-bodiedness.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-analog-lab-v-accessibility-mode-story-music-software-lack-assistive-160013048.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84c5f212-b42e-4724-847c-602b599177bb</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626366523</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T16:29:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7b0b040-e413-11eb-bf1f-639a585d58e4" width="3694" height="3014" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7b0b040-e413-11eb-bf1f-639a585d58e4" width="3694" height="3014" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jason Dasent]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Visually impaired audio engineer Jason Dasent sits in a studio, with his right hand on a keyboard in front of him.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jason Dasent in a studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED pre-orders open today at 3PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to secure the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html"><ins>OLED variant of the Nintendo Switch</ins></a> before its October 8th release date, now’s your chance.

Jeff Bezos&#39; firm has <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/first-customer-on-new-shepard">revealed</a> that the first paying passenger for a New Shepard rocket is Oliver Daemen, who at 18 years old will be the youngest person to visit space. That&#39;s more than a little appropriate when one of his fellow passengers is 82-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html">Wally Funk</a>, who&#39;ll be the oldest person to make the trip.</p><p>The flight is still scheduled for July 20th.

Nonetheless, it&#39;s still historic beyond the ages of some of its passengers. This trip will include an honest-to-goodness paying customer. It might also be the first flight of its kind to technically enter space. While Virgin&#39;s altitude was short of the Kármán line (62 miles) that officially delineates space, Blue Origin is keen to point out that it should cross that symbolic barrier. Think of the July 20th flight as escalating a private space race that&#39;s unlikely to end any time soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-first-paying-customer-151137093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3224a0ee-639a-4597-823d-4ad8396619c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:11:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626361899</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T15:12:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/14083640-e57c-11eb-bdef-e2a1539ca4b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/14083640-e57c-11eb-bdef-e2a1539ca4b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Blue Origin paying passenger Oliver Daemen]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blue Origin paying passenger Oliver Daemen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aston Martin's Valhalla hybrid supercar hints at its EV future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McLaren isn&#39;t the only British supercar maker that can build a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mc-laren-reveals-the-225-k-artura-its-first-production-hybrid-supercar-120027118.html">searingly fast hybrid</a>. Aston Martin has introduced a Valhalla supercar that mates a 740HP, AMG-made 4.0-liter V8 with a 201HP dual electric motor system to produce top-tier performance while cutting emissions. The two-door can reach 62MPH in just 2.5 seconds and hit a top speed of 217MPH, but you can also drive a modest 9 miles in pure EV mode if you can live with an 80MPH top speed.</p><p>The electric technology also helps save weight. The Valhalla includes an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission that uses the hybrid system for reversing, eliminating the need for a conventional reverse gear. Toss in electric-assisted torque vectoring for the all-wheel drive system and the car should be agile, not just quick off the line. Aston predicts a 6:30 lap time for the Nürburgring Nordschleife, although the brand has yet to make an attempt.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/04bf6df0-e579-11eb-bfdf-b7dc1ff07b07" alt="Aston Martin Valhalla rear view" data-uuid="999c2005-3e3b-3f0b-a9ad-e0bd1f6ad4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aston Martin</div></figure><p>You can also expect a relatively light (3,417lbs) carbon fiber body and an adjustable ride height to keep the car usable on less-than-perfect streets.</p><p>Aston will start deliveries near the end of 2023 at prices between £600,000 to £700,000 ($830,000 to $968,000) in the UK, and it will be rare — the company only plans to produce units for about 2.5 years. Even so, it&#39;s an important machine. It gives Aston a foil to McLaren hybrids like the Artura and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-mclaren-speedtail-hybrid-250mph-speeds.html">Speedtail</a>. More importantly, the company sees it as a way to &quot;drive the transition&quot; from combustion engines to pure EVs.

The company has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website">announced</a> plans to break out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-facebook-pay-unification-whatsapp-instagram.html">Facebook Pay</a> from its own ecosystem to facilitate transactions across the web. Starting in August, US-based customers will be able to make purchases from Shopify-powered businesses using the payment method. When you visit a supported seller, you&#39;ll see a Facebook Pay button allowing you to complete a purchase with your saved card or PayPal details.&nbsp;</p><p>In that sense, Facebook will be jostling for attention at checkout with rival mobile and digital wallets including Apple Pay and Google Pay. Of course, each has a built-in audience based on preferred hardware, operating system or, in Facebook&#39;s case, social network.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, Facebook Pay has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-facebook-pay.html">limited</a> to the company&#39;s own platforms including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook has pitched it as an expedient way to shop on those apps, split the bill with friends, send money abroad and donate to charities. Expanding Facebook Pay&#39;s reach across the web not only boosts its convenience, but also fits into the company&#39;s wider ecommerce strategy. In June, Facebook added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-qr-codes-payments-213052047.html">QR codes</a> to the payments platform, enabling users to send money to people outside of their friends group.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, it has integrated shopping features into its wider ecosystem of social apps to capitalize on the shift to ecommerce. In May, Facebook introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-new-shopping-features-171051648.html">Shops</a> that turn business pages on its main platform and Instagram into online storefronts. Like Google and Snapchat before it, the company is also turning to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-visual-search-instagram-shopping-190323553.html">visual search</a> to help people discover more shoppable products on Instagram. Not to be left out, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-shopping-button-152011215.html">WhatsApp</a> also received a shopping button that let users browse a retailer&#39;s product catalog.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pay-online-stores-121041167.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b2798917-7255-4420-8424-d9e31cdb4384</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626349016</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T11:37:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube makes subscriber-only chats and polls available to all streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube has boosted its features for gamers and live-streamers with <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/117186067/availability-updates-for-clips-polls-subscribers-only-chat">three more features</a> borrowed from Twitch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577574/youtube-twitch-features-subscriber-sub-only-chat-polls-clips"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

Developed by researchers at <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis">UC San Francisco</a>, the technique is a more natural way for people with speech loss to communicate than other methods <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">we&#39;ve seen</a> to date.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, neuroprosthetic technology has only allowed paralyzed users to type out just one letter at a time, a process that can be slow and laborious. It also tapped parts of the brain that control the arm or hand, a system that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive for the subject.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The USCF system, however, uses an implant that&#39;s placed directly on the part of the brain dedicated to speech. That way, the subject can mentally activate the brain patterns they would normally use to say a word, and the system can translate the entire word, rather than single letters, to the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it work, patients with normal speech volunteered to have their brain recordings analyzed for speech related activities. Researchers were then able to analyze those patterns and develop new methods to decode them in real time, using statistical language models to improve accuracy.&nbsp;</p><div id="9dc1b71b29ca4459a6eefda9c48dd6ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GMcf1fXdW8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, the team still wasn&#39;t sure if brain signals controlling the vocal tract would still be intact in patients paralyzed for many years. To that end, they enlisted an anonymous participant (known as Bravo1) who worked with researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary that the team could decipher using advanced computer algorithms. That included words like &quot;water,&quot; &quot;family&quot; and &quot;good,&quot; enough to allow the patient to create hundreds of sentences applicable to their daily life. The team also used an &quot;auto-correct&quot; function similar to those found on consumer speech recognition apps.&nbsp;</p><p>To test the system, the team asked patient Bravo1 to reply to questions like &quot;How are you today?&quot; and &quot;Would you like some water?&quot; The patient&#39;s attempted speech then appeared on the screen as &quot;I am very good,&quot; and &quot;No, I am not thirsty.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The system was able to decode their speech at up to 18 words per minute with 93 percent accuracy, with a 75 percent median accuracy. That might not sound great compared to the 200 words per minute possible with normal speech, but it&#39;s much better than the speeds seen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">previous neuroprosthetic systems</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak,” said Edward Chang, MD,  Chair of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and senior author on the study. “It shows strong promise to restore communication by tapping into the brain&#39;s natural speech machinery.”</p><p>The team said the trial represents a proof of principal for this new type of &quot;speech neuroprosthesis.&quot; Next up, they plan to expand the trial to include more participants, while also working to increase the number of words in the vocabulary and improve the rate of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/severely-paralyzed-man-communicates-using-brain-signals-sent-to-his-vocal-tract-110524126.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">788eefc6-08c2-4fe2-b7be-694819d33ec7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:05:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626345334</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T10:35:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UCSF]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's SmartThings app can now track your energy usage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is catering its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/smartthings">SmartThings</a> app updates to our changing lifestyles.

The new feature, called Safe Start, will ask riders attempting to unlock a Bird rental scooter between 10PM and 4AM local time to type in a keyword within the app. That will serve as verification that they&#39;re sober enough to be able to handle a micro-electric vehicle.

The new feature is currently being tested in the US, but Bird says it will roll out everywhere the company operates throughout the summer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/birds-safe-start-discourages-intoxicated-riders-from-using-scooters-100015467.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3295c47f-b8b1-4317-8bdc-830d0ebe525c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 10:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626341545</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T09:32:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8d04fde0-e549-11eb-a7df-dcf8c3c10638" width="1600" height="980" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8d04fde0-e549-11eb-a7df-dcf8c3c10638" width="1600" height="980" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bird]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bird]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bird]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US consumer safety regulator sues Amazon over hazardous product sales]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s handling of defective and potentially unsafe products is back in the spotlight. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Sues-Amazon-to-Force-Recall-of-Hazardous-Products-Sold-on-Amazon-com">suing</a> the online retailer to force it to recall faulty items that pose safety risks to shoppers. In the filing, regulators said they had warned Amazon about the hazardous items on its site, but deemed its response insufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the CPSC, the faulty goods included 24,000 carbon monoxide detectors that failed to alarm, 400,000 hair dryers that lacked electrocution safeguards and children&#39;s sleepwear that could catch fire. The commission voted by 3-1 to approve the legal complaint to compel Amazon to recall the named products, notify customers who purchased them and offer full refunds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/recall/lawsuits/abc/001-In-re-Amazon-com-Inc__.pdf?TvLLxHy1UMfiz3BpfXaKjQy1ibQbYAiU">lawsuit</a>, the retailer has already taken some of those actions. Amazon removed the identification numbers for the specified products, the CPSC said. The company also informed consumers who had purchased the goods that they could present a hazard and offered to compensate them with gift cards credited to their account, the regulator noted. But, the CPSC insisted that Amazon&#39;s &quot;unilateral&quot; response was insufficient.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-sues-amazon-demands-recall-hazardous-products-2021-07-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon said it was &quot;unclear&quot; why the CPSC rejected its offer to expand its recall program, including for products sold by third parties, or sued to force actions &quot;almost entirely duplicative&quot; of those it had taken. The retailer added that it had removed &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the products in question from its store and provided full customer refunds.</p><p>“Today’s vote to file an administrative complaint against Amazon was a huge step forward for this small agency,” said the CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler. “But it’s a huge step across a vast desert—we must grapple with how to deal with these massive third-party platforms more efficiently, and how best to protect the American consumers who rely on them.”</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Amazon has been lambasted for its distribution of hazardous items. Last year, a <em>CNN</em> investigation into customer reviews on the site<em>&nbsp;</em>found 70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">AmazonBasics</a> items had been associated with fires. A 2019 report by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also claimed that Amazon was selling more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">4,000 items</a> that federal agencies had declared unsafe, prompting<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-senators-amazon-unsafe-products-letter.html"> Senators to write to then CEO Jeff Bezos </a>for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Last fall, a California state appeals court ruled that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-liable-defective-thirdparty-products-135528763.html">can be held liable</a> for damages and injuries caused by faulty products sold on its third-party marketplace.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cpsc-amazon-lawsuit-hazardous-products-091349726.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94dc119f-411c-4432-8c84-ccca59e14a56</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 09:13:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626340431</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T09:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Amazon delivery worker pulls a delivery cart full of packages during its annual Prime Day promotion in New York City, U.S., June 21, 2021.

It features Gotoh hardware for &quot;smooth tremolo action and solid tuning stability with a two-point fulcrum and staggered-height locking machine heads.&quot; The EURUS GS-1 guitar will be available in the US in October 2021 for $2,200.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boss-guitar-built-in-synth-and-bluetooth-pedal-control-080328921.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cfd1856-35fd-4b0d-bd4d-b938583b8146</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 08:03:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626336211</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T08:03:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/12c24000-e540-11eb-ae70-38d6f17559f6" width="1800" height="1130" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/12c24000-e540-11eb-ae70-38d6f17559f6" width="1800" height="1130" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BOSS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boss's latest guitar has a built-in synth and Bluetooth pedal control]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boss's latest guitar has a built-in synth and Bluetooth pedal control]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IK Multimedia debuts guitar effects pedals based on its AmpliTube software]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, IK Multimedia has given guitar players the ability to build the rig of their dreams or try their hero&#39;s setup without cramming a bunch of gear into their apartments — or emptying their savings account. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5cs/">AmpliTube modeling software</a> offers the ability to use popular effects, amps and cabinets via digital modeling rather than the hardware itself. But the app resides on computer <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigstompio/?pkey=irig-stomp-io">or tablet</a>, so it&#39;s not exactly the most convenient thing to take on the road. Today, IK Multimedia is debuting the AmpliTube X-GEAR line: a collection of four guitar pedals equipped with versions of the same effects available on the robust desktop software.&nbsp;</p><p>The AmpliTube X-GEAR pedals offer options for distortion (X-DRIVE), modulation (X-VIBE), delay (X-TIME) and reverb (X-SPACE). All four pedals are loaded with 16 different effects and IK Multimedia developed new algorithms for both reverb and delay. The company says that despite giving users a different set of tools, each of the X-GEAR devices uses the same hardware and digital signal processing (DSP).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/38514d80-e50d-11eb-aaf3-19d06510fb75" style="height:1298;width:1600;" alt="IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR" data-uuid="25bf4733-6eca-3998-a9cd-3393c024b808"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IK Multimedia</div></figure><p>Because these are based on powerful software, IK Multimedia says the X-GEAR pedals work well in both the studio and on stage. With the desktop app (AmpliTube SE is included with the pedals), you can make changes and save settings, including up to 300 presets, back to the hardware pedal as needed. Thanks to up to 192kHz internal processing and oversampling, the company says the X-GEAR pedals can give you the same &quot;realism and response&quot; as AmpliTube on the desktop.</p><p>Each X-GEAR pedal is housed in an aluminum shell with 24-bit/192kHz converters to keep noise at a minimum and 5Hz–24kHz frequency response. IK Multimedia says the frequency response combined with an analog dry path and selectable true or soft bypass will allow your guitar&#39;s tone to come through unfiltered. When it&#39;s time to record, the X-GEAR pedals can serve as a USB interface with a digital audio workstation (DAW). You can select between wet or dry signals, use a stereo output for monitoring and employ full MIDI compatibility. On stage, pair any item in the X-GEAR lineup with an expression pedal and you&#39;ll get even more control of each of the parameters on board. There are also five cabinet options on each pedal so you can connect them directly to a PA if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The X-GEAR pedals go on sale in August for $300 each, but you can pre-order them now <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/xgear/">from the company&#39;s website</a>. That price puts IK Multimedia&#39;s latest gear just below multi-effects options like <a href="https://www.strymon.net/product-category/effects-pedals/">Strymon&#39;s BlueSky and Mobius pedals</a>. A key difference though is that IK Multimedia is known for mobile audio interfaces, MIDI controllers and software plug-ins while companies like Strymon are well-respected in the guitar world thanks to their established track records. This is really the first time IK Multimedia has built what many would consider &quot;real&quot; effects pedals, so it will be interesting to see if the company successfully leveraged its software expertise for this new hardware.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="242bea21-4079-4db3-8c66-3752382d8c0d"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ik-multimedia-amplitube-x-gear-pedals-073045987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccb8cad3-4848-4076-ab77-48fe317d576d</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626314132</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T01:55:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IK Multimedia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Delta pilot sues the airline for allegedly stealing an app he designed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">Delta</a> pilot has sued the airline for $1 billion, accusing it of trade secrets theft over a communications app he developed a few years ago. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/delta-pilot-sues-airline-for-1-billion-claiming-stolen-crew-app"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Captain Craig Alexander pitched the QrewLive app, which he reportedly developed with $100,000 of his own money, to the company as a way for crew to easily communicate in case of disrupted flights. However, Delta turned him down and then launched what he says is an identical tool a few years later.</p><p>Alexander apparently contacted Delta CEO Ed Bastian back in 2016 after a computer system meltdown put <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">all flights on hold</a> and cost the company over $150 million. He told the CEO that he had a solution for issues like that, which resulted in several meetings with executives who <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/pilot-files-intellectual-property-lawsuit-against-delta/YM3GFTE3UNFOJMXOEWGUMYQIN4/">gave him</a> verbal assurances that they were going to acquire his app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Alexander&#39;s complaint, Delta ended up telling him that his technology didn&#39;t fit its needs and ultimately launched its own Flight Family Communications app in 2018. He called the official Delta app a &quot;carbon copy, knock-off of the role-based text messaging component of [his] proprietary QrewLive communications platform.&quot; As for how he decided to seek $1 billion in damages, he said it&#39;s &quot;based solely upon operational cost savings to Delta, [which] conservatively exceeds $1 billion.&quot;</p><p>The plaintiff has been with the airline for 11 years and still currently works with the company. Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;While we take the allegations specified in Mr. Alexander&#39;s complaint seriously, they are not an accurate or fair description of Delta&#39;s development of its internal crew messaging platform.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/delta-pilot-sues-airline-app-063637349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc54dfb2-9b56-4fab-8735-125708018c07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 06:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626355619</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T13:27:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mindaugas Dulinskas via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Narita, Japan - January 25, 2017: N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix will reportedly offer video games within the next year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Netflix</a> may be a TV show, movie <em>and</em> game streaming platform in the near future. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-plans-to-offer-video-games-in-expansion-beyond-films-tv"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has hired Mike Verdu, a former Oculus and EA exec, as vice president of game development. Verdu was the VP of augmented and virtual reality games and content at Facebook, where he worked with developers for the Oculus Rift, Quest and Go. From 2017 to 2018, he was also the head of EA Mobile and oversaw the studios that worked on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>, <em>SimCity BuildIt</em>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> and <em>Sims Free Play</em>, among others.</p><p>The company will reportedly build out its gaming team in the coming months to be able to start offering games for streaming within the next year. Netflix isn&#39;t exactly inexperienced in the area and previously developed games based on its popular shows. However, it released those titles on mobile and consoles — <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company won&#39;t be making a separate platform for its upcoming video games and will instead make them available alongside its shows and movies under their own category. Also, the streaming giant reportedly has no plans to charge extra for game access, though it&#39;s unclear if the additional content will lead to a future price hike.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With competitors popping up left and right, Netflix has been looking for ways to grow and make sure it stays ahead, especially in saturated markets like the US. Adding video games to its repertoire seems to be the answer it came up with recently. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"><em>The Information</em></a> first reported that the company was seeking to hire an executive who&#39;d oversee its expansion into video games back in May. Apparently, Netflix approached several veteran execs in the industry regarding the position. Back then, a company spokesperson told <em>The Information</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve continually expanded our offering— from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like <em>Bandersnatch</em> and <em>You v. Wild</em>, or games based on <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>L Casa de Papel</em> and <em>To All the Boys</em>. So we&#39;re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13aacd9-23ac-48a7-8a2c-36ba57da0684</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626332733</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T11:01:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Calgary, Alberta.

That&#39;s about to change, and eventually you&#39;ll no longer need to have a phone nearby to use WhatsApp on the web, macOS, Windows or Portal.</p><p>Starting today, WhatsApp will invite users to try its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html"><ins>multi-device beta</ins></a>. You&#39;ll be able to use the service on your phone and up to four other devices (as long as they also aren&#39;t phones). WhatsApp will try the multi-device approach with a small group of people from its beta program. They&#39;ll be able to opt out of the beta later. With the help of those users, WhatsApp will optimize the multi-device experience and add some more features before rolling it out more broadly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although many users have been requesting multi-device support, it&#39;s taken WhatsApp some time to make that happen. It has built a system that retains end-to-end encryption while letting people sync data like contact names, archives and starred messages across devices.</p><p>Until now, the WhatsApp smartphone app has been an essential conduit for the service. Other platforms like the web and desktop apps maintain a consistent, secure link to the phone app and mirror the content. But if your phone battery dies or there&#39;s an issue with the smartphone app, you can&#39;t use WhatsApp on other platforms.</p><p>Through the multi-device beta, each device will have its own identity key. Currently, users have a single identity key (i.e. the one on their phone) to handle encrypted messages. WhatsApp has <a href="https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/217392192_617386875906350_2307693746154839727_n.pdf/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_V4_Preview.pdf?ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=2fbf2a&amp;_nc_ohc=4NBatF5TfzwAX-aVLCC&amp;_nc_oc=AQmcb-mK8YRXFKR50jznycD5iL0Wr-cAEL2STU9EfokAGZIq6Fn9thP2YmymlwHht6o&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&amp;oh=e9995b3578767e0defaf6163c8a1424e&amp;oe=60F4C687">developed systems</a> it says will keep out eavesdroppers who try to add devices to a user&#39;s account and to minimize the number of times people need to confirm their identity across devices. You&#39;ll also have control over connected devices and see which ones are linked to your account.</p><p>Along with messages, WhatsApp will have E2EE support for voice and video calls as part of the multi-device beta. There won&#39;t be any impact on the way WhatsApp handles cloud backups.&nbsp;</p><p>Solving the issue of supporting E2EE across a user&#39;s devices can be tricky given that only devices that messages are sent to and from are supposed to be able to decrypt them. Apple seems to have found an answer — iMessage supports E2EE across Apple devices. Although Telegram works on multiple devices, its E2EE approach (Secret Chats) <a href="https://tsf.telegram.org/manuals/e2ee-simple"><ins>does not currently do so</ins></a>. Like WhatsApp&#39;s current setup, Signal&#39;s desktop app also needs to <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360008216551-Installing-Signal&#92;">connect to a smartphone</a> to send and receive messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-phone-multi-device-end-to-end-encryption-192123565.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60c61ae4-bbfb-48a7-ad18-2c50b6dbefde</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290557</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:22:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter removed a lot more abusive content in the second half of 2020 than ever before]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is getting better at moderating its platform. That’s one of the main takeaways from the company’s most <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/an-update-to-the-twitter-transparency-center"><ins>recent transparency report</ins></a>, which it shared on Wednesday.  Between July 1st and December 31st, 2020, Twitter says it took action against 964,459 accounts for abusive behavior. Compared to the first six months of 2020, that’s a 142 percent increase. Over the same timeframe, Twitter also removed more hateful content. On that front, the company says it took action against 1,126,990 accounts, a 77 percent increase from the 635,415 accounts it reprimanded in the first half of 2020.</p><p>What’s notable here is that the company attributes the latter increase to policy changes it put in place throughout 2020. Specifically, it calls out the fact that it began taking action on &quot;content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories&quot; as a result of an uptick in harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also calls out an expansion of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hate-speech-rules-race-ethnicity-194849330.html">hateful conduct policy</a> in early December that saw the company prohibit language that “dehumanizes” people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin. Not mentioned in the report — but likely still something that had a positive effect — is the ban the company put in place in July against links to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-links-hateful-conduct-violence-010623900.html"><ins>content that promotes violence and hateful conduct</ins></a>.</p><p>In another part of the report, Twitter also attributes its recent success to better technology. As of the second half of last year, the company claims its automated moderation tools helped it take action against 65 percent of abusive tweets and other behavior before someone had to flag the content for its moderators. To put that percentage in perspective, those tools were about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-twitter-says-better-spotting-abusive-tweets-than-users.html"><ins>50 percent effective</ins></a> by late 2019.</p><p>Obviously, Twitter has yet to completely stop abuse, harassment and hate speech from taking place on its platform, but today’s report shows the company is at least making progress on its 2019 promise to “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-twitter-jack-dorsey-public-square-health.html"><ins>increase the health of public conversation</ins></a>.”&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-second-half-2020-transparency-report-184953614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e4cd13-e7a9-452f-90d1-11a68da11289</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626288596</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:50:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.
