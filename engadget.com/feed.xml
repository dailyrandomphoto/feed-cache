All nine seasons and 180 episodes will be available, so you can start from the beginning or jump to memorable moments like Elaine&#39;s questionable dancing or Jerry&#39;s quest to remember a woman&#39;s name.</p><p>Netflix bought the rights to stream <em>Seinfeld</em> (albeit only for five years) in 2019, wresting the show away from Hulu with promises of access sometime in 2021. However, the eventual timing wasn&#39;t great — the series vanished from Hulu this June, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/seinfeld-netflix-wait-213643513.html">leaving Festivus fans in limbo</a> for all of the summer. It&#39;s still not clear what prompted that gap, although contract terms might have played a role.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Either way, the deal could be important for Netflix. The service has lost multiple &quot;comfort food&quot; shows to rivals in recent years, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-hbo-max.html"><em>Friends</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-the-office-netflix-175224729.html"><em>The Office</em></a>. <em>Seinfeld</em> might not drive many new subscriptions, but it could keep people from jumping ship as they look for a show to stream in the background while they wash dishes or finish their homework.</p><div id="61d767e8d46d4265a60703351e87b9a3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u_bArdgpin0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/seinfeld-netflix-release-date-152222495.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f82a504-8954-4ead-8b21-521a88b38e9d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 15:22:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630509511</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T15:18:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ed46e740-0b32-11ec-b3c3-f063a90b0ede" width="3000" height="1938" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ed46e740-0b32-11ec-b3c3-f063a90b0ede" width="3000" height="1938" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NBC via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEINFELD -- "The Burning" Episode 16 -- Pictured: (l-r) Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Elaine Benes, Jerry Seinfeld as Jerry Seinfeld, Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Michael Richards as Cosmo Kramer -- Photo by: Joey Delvalle/NBCU Photo Bank]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Seinfeld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Man's Sky gets alien settlements you can take charge of]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/no%20mans%20sky"><em><ins>No Man&#39;s Sky</ins></em></a> just celebrated its fifth anniversary, and to underscore just how far the game has come since its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-11-no-mans-sky-bugs-exploit-glitch.html"><ins>rocky debut</ins></a>, Hello Games has released the 17th major update for the space exploration and survival sim.

The social media giant has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/">launched</a> a Fantasy Games feature in the US and Canada with &quot;free, simple&quot; sports and pop culture prediction titles. The fantasy sports  offerings let you predict winners for matches, top players and other stats. MLB Home Run Picks asks you to predict the team with the most home runs in a given day, for instance, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/espn-plus-la-liga-soccer-rights-005834427.html">La Liga</a> Winning Streak challenges you to predict daily wins in the Spanish soccer league for as long as possible.</p><p>You can also guess the victors in reality TV shows like <em>Survivor</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em>. There are promises of other pop culture games, although Facebook didn&#39;t cite examples.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fantasy Games are currently available through Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/facebook/id284882215">iOS</a> apps. You&#39;ll find them both through the bookmarks menu as well as through notifications in the News Feed.</p><p>Facebook clearly isn&#39;t interested in direct competition with for-money fantasy game services like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nfl-draftkings-fanduel-betting-agreement-223743539.html">DraftKings and FanDuel</a>, at least not right now. However, there are still plenty of incentives for the social network to launch Fantasy Games. The feature could keep you coming back, boosting ad revenue as well as your overall engagement with Facebook. It also opens the door to paid fantasy games in the future. Still, this might hit the spot if you&#39;ve been tempted by fantasy sports but don&#39;t want to spend real money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-fantasy-sports-pop-culture-games-142705123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fea8f738-6183-4381-971d-85e4599718a3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 14:27:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630506428</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T14:27:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fantasy Sports]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says eight states have signed up to let people store IDs in Wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Residents of some states will soon be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html"><ins>add their driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet</ins></a>, and Apple has revealed which states will support the initiative at the outset.

You’ll need to scan the card with your phone and take a selfie for verification by your state. When you tap your device at TSA checkpoints, it will display a prompt listing the info that the agency is asking for. Once you authorize the request with Face ID or Touch ID, your iPhone or Apple Watch will share those details with the TSA, so you don’t even need to show your device to an agent or scanner.</p><p>Apple says it will store your ID securely. The function will be available as part of iOS 15, which Apple will likely release this month, if past release dates are anything to go by. The latest major version of the firmware will also allow you to add work badges and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-home-keys-wwdc-2021-183759604.html"><ins>unlock some smart locks and door locks</ins></a>.

As <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-self-driving-shuttles-paralympics-crash-pedestrian/">reports</a>, the automaker has <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35956185.html">resumed</a> use of its self-driving shuttle at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-epalette-tokyo-paralympic-games-collision-201745169.html">following a collision</a> with a visually impaired athlete. Not surprisingly, both Toyota and the games&#39; Organizing Committee have made changes in light of the crash — they&#39;ve determined that both the autonomous vehicle and the circumstances around it were to blame.</p><p>The company noted there were only two guide people at the intersection where the collision occurred, making it difficult for them to watch all vehicles and pedestrians at the same time. There also wasn&#39;t a &quot;sufficient&quot; way of coordinating between guides and vehicle operators (such as the manual &#39;backups&#39; for the e-Palette). It simply wasn&#39;t possible to ensure safety at this signal-free intersection without everyone working together, Toyota said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has upgrade the e-Palette itself with louder approach warning sounds, more crew members and tweaks to manual acceleration and braking. Organizers, meanwhile, have increased the number of guides, created an alternative to traffic signals, and split those guides into groups devoted to pedestrians and vehicles. Toyota and the Committee vowed to refine the system on a &quot;daily basis&quot; through the rest of the Paralympics, which end on September 5th.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear if these changes will be enough. However, this does serve as a reminder that self-driving vehicle tech is still in its infancy — it could be a while before Toyota and other brands can completely trust <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-toyota-denso-chip-manufacture.html">onboard computing power</a> to safely navigate streets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-resumes-self-driving-e-palette-use-paralympics-132634264.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98c872c8-eb74-4c7a-82a3-a24378b9569f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:26:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630503127</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T13:32:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tomohiro Ohsumi via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 23: Toyota Motor Corp.'s e-Palette Concept autonomous vehicle is displayed during a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show on October 23, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.

If you feel comfortable sacrificing on sound, the same model with a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2.2 channel system" href="https://amzn.to/2V7FCni">2.2 channel system</a> has dropped to $2,998. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s matching both prices" href="https://fave.co/3juFc3D">Samsung&#39;s matching both prices</a>, so you could buy direct from the company if you prefer.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BKj6AH" id="5613e2372c094e61a9d19a2467357fc0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Premiere (4.2Ch sound) at Amazon - $5,498</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3juFc3D" id="1b54b05b75e5446bbc6c59697b4c8222" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Premiere (4.2Ch sound) at Samsung - $5,499</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2V7FCni" id="7bc67fc9123a449590dfa00411094d74" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Premiere (2.2Ch sound) at Amazon - $2,998</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3juFc3D" id="af296f7fdca44e1d9eed6d8ee08925b5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Premiere (2.2Ch sound) at Samsung - $2,999</a><p>The Premiere made it onto <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-projectors-123004354.html">our list of favorite projectors</a> in a premium category, and it&#39;s worth the price if you want one of the best big-screen experiences available. It includes separate red, green and blue lasers so it can cover the full Rec.2020 color range, which is something even most high-end TVs cannot boast. This is as close as you&#39;ll get to a true 4K projector too, and it supports HDR10+ and up to 2,800 lumens of brightness.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That 4.2.2 surround sound system completes the package, allowing you to get close to a theatrical experience in your living room or backyard. We also like its relatively attractive and compact design — it looks nice enough to keep out in your home and, being an ultra-short throw machine, you can place it close to a wall and still get a crisp image.</p><p>The Premiere also has most smart features you&#39;d expect a projector to have today, including virtual assistant support and streaming apps. Running on Samsung&#39;s Tizen operating system for smart TVs, you can ask Alexa, the Google Assistant or Bixby to do things for you as well as stream from services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and others. So while it&#39;s not cheap by any means even when on sale, the Premiere is an investment gadget that will provide an excellent entertainment experience for a long time.</p><p>A couple of Samsung TVs round out the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:rest of the sale" href="https://amzn.to/3mOJCEv">rest of the sale</a> on Amazon - the 82-inch <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung Q60T Series 4K smart TV" href="https://amzn.to/3yzjekm">Samsung Q60T Series 4K smart TV</a> is roughly $500 off, bringing it down to $1,698, and you can grab a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Terrace outdoor 4K TV" href="https://amzn.to/3jxk7pe">Terrace outdoor 4K TV</a> for as low as $2,998.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-premiere-projector-sale-1000-off-home-entertainment-sale-amazon-130328219.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61cfbe5d-2413-4673-b4a3-54925f92b598</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:03:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630501462</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T13:04:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/57d0c830-d35a-11eb-b8ff-c90eba888aff" width="1500" height="1085" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/57d0c830-d35a-11eb-b8ff-c90eba888aff" width="1500" height="1085" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAMSUNG 130" The Premiere Projector]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ SAMSUNG 130" The Premiere Projector]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Must-have gear to make traveling with kids easier]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Traveling with young children is like trying to turn a cruise ship: It’s cumbersome, takes a significant amount of planning and requires a team effort. Because I apparently lack any amount of common sense, I recently took a 3,000-mile RV trip with my partner and two toddlers. Traveling with little ones can be stressful because they rely so much on their established routines; anything that deviates from that is going to be hard for them and you.</p><p>While we tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy by bringing along familiar toys and blankets, we also took the advice of a close friend who is an early childhood development specialist. She recommended keeping our twins engaged and entertained by grouping toys or activities together and rotating them throughout the day. Here are a few things that we tried that we’ll be returning to the next time we travel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Music</h2><p>Depending on how you’re traveling, music can be a great way to entertain tiny travelers. The repetition in children’s songs help kids learn patterns and expand their vocabulary. What’s more, musical play encourages movement along with both fine and gross motor skills. That’s great if you’re in a car where you can clap, sing and wiggle, but gets more challenging when you’re stuck on an aircraft with dozens of other people who don’t want to hear “Old MacDonald” seven(-ty-seven) times in a row.</p><h3>Instruments</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5a817050-0a70-11ec-bedf-f60dcbd0a7c3" style="height:969;width:1400;" alt="Sesame Street Music Player" data-uuid="6cad224e-2da6-3338-b521-462f40a2828e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sesame Street</div></figure><p>My mom bought us this “<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:CD player" href="https://amzn.to/38qfK8Z">CD player</a>” for our trip and weeks later, the twins are still fighting over it. My daughter really likes the music, my son really likes taking the “CD” out repeatedly to figure out how the player works, and they both like the colorful book of lyrics. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fisher Price" href="https://amzn.to/38lKNmo">Fisher Price</a> has a similar option with light-up buttons, which is perfect for occupying little hands.</p><p>Another cool gadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-educational-toys-for-kids-123055311.html">we’ve recommended</a> in the past is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blipbox" href="https://amzn.to/3kyCTvE">Blipbox</a>, an entry-level synthesizer that comes with 300 melodies and a synchronized light show. It contains a digital synth engine that includes an amp envelope, two LFOs, a modulation envelope and a low-pass filter — perfect for teaching kids about creating music while also entertaining their caretakers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38qfK8Z" id="f978a3306c344561bf3c7c4aa6e3dca6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Sesame Street CD player at Amazon - $10</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38lKNmo" id="b4a732fdbdd14e38bc5ea09ca5e9a6c3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fisher Price CD player at Amazon - $19</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3kyCTvE" id="ab55662e657646f6ac79901482b90323" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blipbox at Amazon - $189</a><h3>Spotify playlists</h3><p>When my twins were infants, the only thing that got them to sleep was playing Maxence Cyrin’s version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NZdggNUvq0">“Where is my mind?”</a> on repeat. We still have a classical playlist of songs for when it’s time to sleep, but I also keep a playlist of songs that are entertaining for adult passengers as well (think: “Yellow Submarine” and songs by They Might Be Giants). It’s nice both to switch up the endless parade of nursery rhymes and expose them to different types of music.</p><h3>YouTube playlists</h3><p>On the other hand, kids respond to nursery rhymes because they incorporate simple melodies, repetition and actions (some of which can be easy to do while seated). YouTube has dozens of long playlists of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlvIFV_8v7Q">classic nursery rhymes</a>, some of which include the lyrics, which is helpful if you’re like me and have long forgotten the words to “Three Blind Mice.”</p><h3>Podcasts</h3><p>Older kids might enjoy one of the many educational podcasts out there. As a bonus, if they’re able to keep headphones on for a decent stretch of time, this makes for a good airplane option, too. As an avid podcast fan myself, I’m excited for my twins to be old enough to enjoy them with me, and I’ve already bookmarked several to try out. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids">But Why?</a> podcast from NPR answers questions that kids send in themselves from “how do you make ice cream?” to “why do we wear clothes?” If your kid is into science, try <a href="https://www.brainson.org/episodes">Brains On</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencepodcastforkids.com/">Tumble</a> to explore topics like “how far can a cloud travel?’ and “how to become an astronaut.”</p><p>For more narrative style podcasts, check out <a href="https://www.littlestoriestinypeople.com/">Little Stories for Tiny People</a> or <a href="https://bedtime.fm/storytime">Story Time</a>. And for those kids, and parents, who are into exploring different musical genres, there’s <a href="https://saturdaycerealbowl.podbean.com/">the Saturday Morning Cereal Bowl</a> and <a href="https://sparetherock.com/wordpress/">Spare the Rock, Spoil the Child</a> podcasts, which feature songs from the Orb, Cake and Bob Marley.</p><h2>Interactive</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818d8bc0-df5a-11eb-bf7f-16d114f3b674" style="height:1200;width:2000;" alt="Montessori Busy Board for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="29271609-9441-3879-ab86-e71cee7c7280"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / deMoca</div></figure><p>Being stuck in a car or plane seat for long periods of time can make it challenging to find activities that involve younger kids’ need to explore, but there are still a few options. Most notably, a kids camera, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Action Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3gEu1Up">Action Cam</a> or the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Creator Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3jybefm">Creator Cam</a> from VTech, can help them stay amused. They can document the trip with photos, videos and use stop-motion or time-lapse effects. The Action Cam can be mounted on a bike and comes with a waterproof case, while the Creator Cam comes with a small tripod and includes more than 20 animated backgrounds that the kids can use to spice up their photos and videos.</p><p>For kids younger than the recommended age for a camera, I like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:busy boards" href="https://amzn.to/3zp3FNo">busy boards</a>. Car time with my twins has become a lot easier since we got a few of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:soft, zippered activity books" href="https://amzn.to/38kD3RO">soft, zippered activity books</a> that feature a variety of buckles, zippers and clasps for them to fiddle with.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3gEu1Up" id="3573f82060f1429889b521fa2a7110bc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy VTech action cam at Amazon - $53</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3jybefm" id="149f623d3f2e4671a0f721e85e73f390" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy VTech creator cam at Amazon - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zp3FNo" id="7549df587a5e47aeb99ee37920e93ce3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy deMoca busy board at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38kD3RO" id="dcdd845b91d341d1b797cd5588eb6b3a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy deMoca quiet book at Amazon - $80</a><h2>Arts and crafts</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e72d66d0-0a70-11ec-bffd-faefb03f174d" style="height:1059;width:1500;" alt="Etch A Sketch" data-uuid="6ade36a0-025b-300c-888a-e64fe489e58d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Etch A Sketch</div></figure><p>If your child is into arts and crafts, you’re not out of luck when traveling (although maybe leave the glitter at home).

I honestly can’t wait to load up the Harry Potter series and a selection of Roald Dahl onto an e-reader for them.</p><p>In the meantime, I compromised by taking short videos of me reading through some of their favorites, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Grumpy Monkey" href="https://amzn.to/3sUzLxS">Grumpy Monkey</a>, and brought a selection of others like their <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Indestructible" href="https://amzn.to/2USne1w">Indestructible</a> books. Not only are the Indestructible books rip-proof and chew-proof but they’re also washable so you don’t have to worry about them getting wet.

It&#39;s not such a far-fetched story, seeing as the tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">recently announced</a> its own mobile chip called Tensor that&#39;s slated to debut on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.

The company may have decided to use their expertise to work on a processor for Chromebooks, as well.</p><p><em>Nikkei</em> says the tech giant was inspired by the success of its rival when it comes to developing its own chips for the iPhone, iPad and, most recently, Mac computers. The first Macs and iPad Pros powered by Apple&#39;s M1 processor launched in 2020, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">first iMacs</a> with the chip became available earlier this year. Google&#39;s in-progress Chromebook chip is reportedly based on designs from Softbank&#39;s ARM, like most mobile processors out there. By building the processor itself, the company will be able to customize it to meet its needs and to add its own features. It&#39;ll lessen Google&#39;s reliance on third-party suppliers, in other words, allowing it to control production as it sees fit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google plans to release the processors it&#39;s developing for Chromebooks in 2023, <em>Nikkei</em> says.

Locast has lost the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-cbs-abc-nbc-fox-sue-locast-copyright-infringement.html">courtroom skirmish</a> started by CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox, which said that the company was violating their copyright. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/broadcasters-locast-copyright-lawsuit-1234825244/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that the quartet’s request for summary judgment was granted, saying that it couldn’t use its non-profit status as a defense against further action.</p><p>The big four, of course, don’t believe Locast’s aims were anywhere near as public-minded as the company made out. The body was reportedly backed, in part, by AT&amp;T and Dish Network, and the networks feel that the whole project was set up as a way of dodging carriage fees. Part of Locast’s defense was that US copyright law allows third parties to boost local signals, and that it acted like a signal booster station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s worth noting that Locast’s founder David Goodfriend, a lawyer and former FCC legal advisor, conceived of Locast in the wake of Aero’s destruction at the hands of the big networks. A 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/locast-streaming-free-network-tv.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> profile explained that he had designed the legal situation to be “compliant within the law.” The profile is even titled that the company would “love to get sued” to act as a test-case for the rules.</p><p>The court found that Locast’s policy of expanding into new markets runs contrary to the aim of a non-profit, where cash should be used to cover running costs only. Judge Louis Stanton said that the cash raised from Locast’s $5-per-month (don’t call it a) subscription was being used to bankroll further expansion and earned  “far more money from user charges than was necessary.”</p><p>It didn’t help, that when some TV providers have entered into carriage disputes, Locast has been cited as a way of still accessing that content. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/networks-sue-to-stop-streaming-service-offering-free-tv-feeds-11564584062?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> wrote back in 2019, DirecTV and Dish customers were directed to access Locast, although Dish and AT&amp;T both said that this was only because it felt that it was obliged to offer the choice to its users.</p><p>By removing Locast’s major legal shield, it’s certainly likely that the project will soon have yet more lawyers on their door. After all, were it to survive, it would be a challenge both to the profitability of the major TV players and encouragement to any future upstarts looking to disrupt the space.</p><p>In a statement, Locast said that the ruling was “disappointing,” citing commentary from the EFF adding that the “court interpreted the law in an artificially-narrow way.” The EFF added that “over three million people use Locast to access local TV, including many who can’t afford cable and can’t pick up their local stations with an antenna. This ruling threatens their access to local news and vital information during a global pandemic.” It closed by saying that the ruling “treats copyright law not as an engine of progress but a moat protecting the most privileged position of the four giant broadcasting networks.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/locast-broadcast-lawsuit-copyright-loss-104215298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f64b264f-610e-4c41-8261-0462b6228720</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 10:42:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630492937</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T10:42:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/56b0c390-0b10-11ec-bbbd-fbf17d8a63e8" width="5292" height="3609" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/56b0c390-0b10-11ec-bbbd-fbf17d8a63e8" width="5292" height="3609" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Portland Press Herald via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OLD ORCHARD BEACH, ME - MARCH 5: The over-the-air TV antenna that Pat Brown installed at her Old Orchard Beach home, photographed on Thusday, March 5, 2020.

The goal, the company told the publication, is for you to be able to hear the voice assistant&#39;s responses over the noise in your home or office.

Alexa has long had a &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-18-amazon-alexa-whisper-mode-rolls-out-today.html">whisper mode</a>,&quot; however, which can make it respond in a softer voice when you whisper commands to it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re in the US and want to give Adaptive Volume a try, simply activate it by saying &quot;Alexa, turn on adaptive volume.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alexa-adaptive-volume-074739210.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4875590-d2e1-46b9-900b-56235f966e74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:47:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630482486</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T07:48:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bc23ad0-0af1-11ec-bbcf-6e8371dde746" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bc23ad0-0af1-11ec-bbcf-6e8371dde746" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch streamers are taking a day off to protest hate raids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch streamers are planning to step away from the platform on September 1st for a day of protest, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/11/twitch-do-better-hate-raids/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> has reported.

CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/extending-our-voluntary-return-office/">told employees</a> the company is delaying the mandatory return to office until January 2022. The current voluntary scheme will last through January 10th. From then on, Google&#39;s offices will make the decisions about when (and if) to make office work mandatory. Staff will be notified 30 days in advance if they&#39;re required to show up.</p><p>The internet pioneer previously hoped to institute a hybrid work week on October 18th, with staff coming in for three out of five days. That, in turn, was later than the originally planned September return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reasoning behind the delay isn&#39;t surprising. The COVID-19 pandemic recovery, and thus the return to offices, has been &quot;longer and bumpier than expected,&quot; according to Pichai. In other words, factors like the virus&#39; Delta variant, vaccination rates and varying case levels have clouded the situation — what works well in one country could be dangerous in another.</p><p>Not that Google will take chances regardless. The company now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">requires full vaccination</a> for any employee returning to the office, voluntary or otherwise.

Samsung is <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users">rolling out</a> a One UI 3.1.1 update that brings many of those phones&#39; multitasking and app resizing features to the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">Fold</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">Fold 2</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Flip</a> and Flip 5G.</p><p>The Fold line unsurprisingly benefits the most thanks to its larger, tablet-like screen. Features like Multi-Active Window (up to three apps at once) and App Split View (seeing extra content for an app) make that folding display much more useful. You can also force apps to resize and rotate on your Fold, pin your favorites with the Taskbar and mirror your internal display on the cover screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not that Flip owners are out of luck. Drag &amp; Split lets all Samsung foldable owners create a new window for an already-open app, and you can invoke Flex Mode to bring up media controls when the phone is partially folded.</p><p>Most of these features are deploying now, although you&#39;ll have to wait an extra week if you&#39;re using the first Galaxy Fold. Not that you&#39;ll likely mind. This could significantly improve the usefulness of your older foldable, and suggests Samsung is eager to earn the loyalty of early adopters — if just to increase the chances that you&#39;ll buy another Fold or Flip when you&#39;re due for an upgrade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-3-1-1-galaxy-z-fold-2-185330625.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52a096ef-ddf6-4c82-bef9-c9372c55478d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:53:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630435496</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T18:45:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Punishing platformer 'Ghostrunner' adds accessibility mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://t.co/gSKwtcUxZu?amp=1"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a> was one of the best surprises of 2020. It’s a stylish first-person platformer that takes the best elements of <em>Titanfall’s</em> parkour mechanics and adds a cyberpunk twist to the proceedings. It’s also a challenging game that demands precision and purpose from the player. Make a single mistake, and you’ll need to replay a section of a level again. That can get frustrating fast, so developer One More Level is adding a new feature called Assist Mode.</p><div id="ded5dc8643a545019515a8c4ee45d98c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e4V-j1mlAJE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Assist Mode introduces three options you can toggle on and off. You can opt to shorten your character’s ability cooldowns, slow down the game to give you more time to react and play with an extra life to make mistakes less punishing. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-225557288.html">Accessibility modes</a> are becoming more common in video games, and it’s always good to see another developer find a way to allow more people to enjoy their work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For experienced players, there’s a new feature called Wave Mode that is essentially  <em>Ghostrunner’s</em> take on a roguelike. You’ll need to complete 20 rounds in succession, with each one featuring different enemies — even when you attempt the same one multiple times. Make it all the way to the end, and you’ll earn a fancy new katana for your character.</p><p>Both Assist and Wave modes are available today for free on the platforms where you can already buy <em>Ghostrunner</em>. That includes PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam, the Epic Games Store and GOG. When the game makes its way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on September 28th, it will come with those modes included.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ghostrunner-assist-mode-dlc-183350979.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1301c871-ffeb-442c-b28b-d02611480e33</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:33:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630434915</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T18:35:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bd31a4a0-0a88-11ec-b9ab-7086fc8346c2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bd31a4a0-0a88-11ec-b9ab-7086fc8346c2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[One More Level]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ghostrunner]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ghostrunner]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EA dips back into college football with Campus Legends event in Madden NFL 22]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ea">Electronic Arts</a> is dipping back into college football with a limited-time mode in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/madden-nfl-22-release-date-152359613.html"><em>Madden NFL 22</em></a>.

In most cases, you’re probably best off visiting your local bike shop to see what they have on offer, but with how difficult it&#39;s been to buy a new bicycle during the pandemic, it never hurts to have another place to shop for your next ride.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-buy-starts-selling-e-bikes-electric-scooters-171330423.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99f044df-60e2-4ce7-8f92-134de84a2d13</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 17:13:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630430681</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T17:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00fa0da0-0a7d-11ec-95ff-f24748b71d4c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00fa0da0-0a7d-11ec-95ff-f24748b71d4c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Best Buy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Best Buy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Best Buy e-bike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon may jump into live audio with a focus on music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon may be the next to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">hop on the live audio bandwagon</a>, although its take might not be what you&#39;d expect. <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-live-audio-clubhouse-competitor-ea0ead59-f6d3-49a0-a216-a4105e0338ba.html">sources</a> claim Amazon is developing a live audio offering that would focus on music, including concerts and other events — more like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-clubhouse-competitor-live-audio-chat-locker-room-music-sports-culture-135957628.html">Spotify</a> than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html">Clubhouse</a>.

It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Amazon leapt into the live audio space, at least. Amazon recently integrated Twitch streams into the Music app, and the firm&#39;s acquisition of podcast subscription business Wondery in 2020 signalled an intent to dive further into audio. There&#39;s also the simple matter of competition. Spotify, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ticketed-spaces-launching-224353538.html">Twitter Spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">Facebook&#39;s audio rooms</a> could all pose a threat, even if Clubhouse doesn&#39;t.

The move, which was first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html"><em>Axios</em></a>, follows tests in the US, Canada, Brazil and Indonesia earlier this year, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reducing-political-content-test-145126460.html"><ins>Facebook limited political content</ins></a>. The company plans to expand the tests to Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain and Ireland.</p><p>&quot;These changes are in response to common feedback from our community,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We conduct ongoing research with people to hear what parts of Facebook are working well for them, and to gather feedback about what we could be doing better. One of the themes we’ve heard is that some people feel that there’s too much political content in their News Feeds. We hope these changes address this feedback and preserve the ability for people to find and interact with political content on Facebook, while respecting their appetite for it at the top of their News Feed.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook says some engagement signals are better than others at indicating which posts people deem interesting or valuable. As a result, the company is expanding some tests related to engagement signals. The tests put less importance on how likely a user is to share or comment on political content. &quot;At the same time, we’re putting more emphasis on new signals such as how likely people are to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-news-feed-surveys-negative-experiences-181349913.html">provide us with negative feedback</a> on posts about political topics and current events when we rank those types of posts in their News Feed,&quot; Facebook wrote in an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">updated blog post</a>.</p><p>The changes could reduce the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html"><ins>level of misinformation</ins></a> on Facebook, if the algorithms are able to effectively detect and de-emphasize all political content. Political campaigns might have to rethink their strategies of how to reach voters too. On the flip side, the move could come as a blow to news organizations, especially those focused on politics, given the volume of traffic Facebook can drive to websites.</p><p>The switch could also make Facebook a less hostile place for users. Political discussions can quickly get heated, which might put off those who use the service largely for keeping in touch with their loved ones and sharing pictures of their kids. For what it&#39;s worth, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-explains-what-people-see-news-feed-crowdtangle-015627086.html"><ins>claimed in November</ins></a> political content makes up just six percent of what users see.</p><p>&quot;We’ve learned that these changes will affect public affairs content more broadly and that publishers may see an impact on their traffic,&quot; Facebook said. &quot;Knowing this, we are planning a gradual and methodical rollout for these tests, but remain encouraged, and expect to announce further expansions in the coming months.&quot;</p><p>The reported changes follow other moves that Facebook has made to make political content less visible. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-groups-policy-2021-161815048.html"><ins>stopped</ins></a> recommending civic and political groups to users earlier this year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-groups-social-issues-recommendations-election-175158432.html"><ins>temporarily pausing</ins></a> those recommendations ahead of the 2020 US election.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-down-rank-news-feed-162401398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af62282b-08f4-4552-9b59-8c32e9015ae7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:24:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630426810</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T16:20:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/db0cb370-a701-11ea-bf7e-89ef5ff9a2e3" width="5388" height="3426" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/db0cb370-a701-11ea-bf7e-89ef5ff9a2e3" width="5388" height="3426" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[wellesenterprises via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Menlo Park, CA, USA – March 18, 2014: A sign at the entrance to the Facebook World Headquarters located in Menlo Park.

The publisher calls this a gameplay reveal, but it&#39;s mostly a showcase of what developer Visual Concepts managed to do with the new hardware from Sony and Microsoft. Thankfully, the studio also <a href="https://nba.2k.com/courtside-report/nba-2k22-gameplay">published a new Courtside Report</a> that details some of the gameplay enhancements players can look forward to when they pick the game up next month.</p><div id="16ecc16a2ada47eab90adb00688fe6c3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OcUzwnA569M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To start, Visual Concepts says it completely rebuilt the shot contest and blocking systems, as well as made a significant update to how the game handles defensive rotations. When it comes to moving a player up the court, the studio promises tighter controls that will allow you to put together new combos in creative ways.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But some of the most significant changes look like they’re coming to how the game handles shooting. <em>NBA 2K22</em> will feature a new shot meter that will dynamically change depending on the abilities of the player you’re controlling and whether their shot is contested. According to Visual Concepts, <em>NBA 2K22</em> will put a greater emphasis on Shot IQ. You’ll be more successful if you take the time to find an open teammate and take a smart shot. For players who like to drive to the basket, there’s a new dunk style creator that will allow you to customize their dunk repertoire.</p><p>Outside of those improvements, fans of women&#39;s basketball can look forward to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k22-wnba-mode-details-150025247.html">much-improved WNBA mode</a>. All told, it looks like NBA 2K&#39;s second PS5 and Xbox Series X outing should be a good one.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k22-gameplay-trailer-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-161855428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a157525b-9540-490e-a8fd-9a045d418123</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:18:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630426590</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T07:21:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Basketball]]></category><category><![CDATA[National Basketball Association]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2ac72b70-0a75-11ec-bfbf-611f235e1732" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2ac72b70-0a75-11ec-bfbf-611f235e1732" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Visual Concepts / 2K]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NBA 2K22]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NBA 2K22]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
