The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">declared</a> &quot;with a high degree of confidence&quot; that hackers linked to China&#39;s Ministry of State Security (MSS) were responsible for a digital espionage campaign using the Exchange vulnerabilities. Officials have confronted senior Chinese leadership with this and &quot;broader&quot; hostile online activity, the White House said.</p><p>The US further accused China of running an intelligence operation that relied on &quot;contract hackers&quot; who frequently launched attacks meant solely for profit, such as ransomware schemes and crypto jacking. The Chinese government&#39;s reported unwillingness to tackle these abuses is believed to hurt businesses, governments and infrastructure with &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in damage, the White House said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the Justice Department has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">revealed</a> indictments of four MSS-affiliated Chinese men for allegedly conducting an extended hacking campaign meant to steal intellectual property and trade secrets, including health research. The initiative, which ran between 2011 and 2018, reportedly saw Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, Zhu Yunmin and Wu Shurong compromise comptuers worldwide to grab information ranging from autonomous vehicle technology and chemical formulas through to research on Ebola, AIDS and other diseases.</p><p>Biden&#39;s administration has already taken multiple actions in response to attacks, including &quot;proactive network defense actions&quot; like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-hafnium-exchange-server-060721872.html">deleting backdoors</a> on compromised Exchange servers. It added private companies to its Unified Coordination Group to bolster its security incident response. CISA, the FBI and the NSA also released an advisory outlining China&#39;s strategy for compromising US and ally networks using the Exchange holes and other methods.</p><p>This comes on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dhs-tsa-cybersecurity-rules-pipeline-companies-colonial-pipeline-164141100.html">stricter security rules</a> for pipeline companies as well as a pilot to tackle vulnerabilities in sectors like electricity and water supply.</p><p>China has historically denied involvement in attacks like these, and it&#39;s doubtful the country will have a change of heart after this. The White House effort is more of a warning — the US will not only pin attacks on China, but respond to them in kind.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/white-house-blames-china-for-exchange-cyberattacks-132053693.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8552d474-22be-4f33-906d-24fe2f2f25c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:20:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626700856</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:21:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WANG ZHAO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chinese honour guards prepare for celebrations in Beijing on July 1, 2021, to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

ENEA&#39;s cameras are placed in the vicinity of artworks to collect data on the amount of observers and their behavior as they stare at the pieces. The collated info defines the “attraction value” of works of art, the researchers behind it told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/new-museum-technology-collects-data-on-viewing-habits"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>More broadly, the so-called ShareArt system is viewed as a way of boosting visitors to museums and galleries after a period of disruptive lockdowns. It could ultimately be used to give certain works more prominence in a collection. The data could also result in changes to the staging of a piece, including how paintings and sculptures are lit and placed in relation to one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/613cf630-e88d-11eb-bf7f-3f30fed1abf1" alt="ENEA" data-uuid="753755db-78a1-306e-b295-b06e3167e725"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ENEA</div></figure><p>Though it dates back to 2016, museums like the Istituzione Bologna Musei have only recently begun rolling out the ShareArt system, notes <em>Bloomberg. </em>Thanks to the tech, researchers are already gaining surprising insights into the way we perceive and interact with art. They found that the average artwork observation time is just four to five seconds, with very few pieces capturing visitors&#39; attention for longer than 15 seconds. They add that if mask restrictions are dropped, the system will be able to track facial observations without compromising privacy, allowing the team to monitor cognitive reactions, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The ShareArt tool is the latest example of art melding with technology.

Whether you’re heading to a physical campus, taking classes online or a mix of both, a laptop is likely going to be the control center for your studies.</p><p>And things have changed quite a bit over the last year or so. We’ve seen the introduction of Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks and Microsoft just announced Windows 11. With ARM-based computers harkening a future where the line between mobile and desktop computing is blurry and Windows 11 working to bridge that gap by supporting Android apps, the laptop market is the most exciting it’s been in years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But that might lead to more questions for shoppers. What should you look out for if you want an ARM-based PC? Will they run  Windows 11 when that update is available? What are some key specs you should add to your must-have list this year? We compiled this guide to help you make the right choice, alongside a list of this year’s best laptops.</p><h2>What to look for in a laptop for school (and what to avoid)</h2><p>First: Windows on ARM still isn’t worth it. Snapdragon laptops may look and feel classy, offer excellent battery life and cellular connections, but they’re typically too expensive, especially considering their limited app compatibility and finicky software. Apple’s M1 MacBooks, on the other hand, are great for almost everyone, barring those who need external GPUs, niche software or more than 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Over on the Intel side of things, almost every notebook released this year packs an 11th-generation Core processor. You’ll likely be able to find a cheaper version of a product with a 10th-generation chip, and it should still serve you well. And don’t forget about AMD’s Ryzen, either — they’re plenty powerful and no longer just for the bargain bin. If you&#39;re eagerly awaiting the arrival of Windows 11 devices, don&#39;t expect to see them before the semester begins. They&#39;re more likely to show up in the fall around Microsoft&#39;s usual hardware event in October.</p><p>Across the industry, companies have shifted to taller aspect ratios for their screens. The Surface Laptops sport 3:2 panels, and many Dell and HP models offer 16:10. While the older 16:9 format is nice for watching videos, you’ll probably appreciate a taller option when you’re writing an essay. Some devices, like Dell’s XPS and Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro, come with OLED panels, which will be nice for working with photos and videos. They usually cost more and take a toll on battery life, though, so you’ll need to weigh your priorities.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a diverse selection of laptops around, so you should be able to find a suitable one regardless of your preferences. Here are our favorite notebooks for your return to academia.</p><h2><strong>Apple MacBook Air M1</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37c97a60-df2f-11eb-9ecb-f6cb740aca90"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With its swift performance, slim fanless design and excellent battery life, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">MacBook Air M1</a> is a no-brainer for any Apple user. You’ll appreciate familiar features like the Retina display, solid keyboard and trackpad. Plus thanks to the company’s excellent Rosetta 2 emulator software, you won’t notice a huge performance difference when relying on Intel apps.</p><p>The big news though, is the ARM-based M1 allows the laptop to run iPhone and iPad apps too. While not every app will be available on macOS, the potential for more options on your desktop here is great. Now you just have to make sure you can keep the distractions at bay — which should be easy with the upcoming Focus modes on macOS Monterey, which rolls out later this year.</p><p>Unfortunately for those looking for more internal storage or something to run their bespoke video streaming setup, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> tops out at 256GB storage while both the Air and the Pro only go up to 16GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro M1 also lacks support for multiple monitors and an external GPU. Those with more demanding workflows might need to look to Windows or an Intel-powered MacBook to ensure app compatibility.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Dell XPS 13</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53f7ae50-df2f-11eb-abef-05df19e0597f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Dell’s XPS series has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">our favorite for years</a>. Despite a somewhat plain design that some might call “classic,” the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">XPS 13</a> still stands out for nailing pretty much everything a laptop should have. Great performance? Check. Gorgeous screen? Check. Comfortable keyboard? Check. Throw in a long-lasting battery and a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-laptops-11th-gen-intel-cpus-130009045.html">the latest versions</a>, and you’ve got a powerful workhorse for all your classes (and more).</p><p>The company shifted to a 16:10 aspect ratio in 2020, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">recently added a 4K OLED option</a>. That means you’ll see greater contrast ratios and deeper blacks for maximum display goodness. The OLED configuration will cost you $300 more than the Full HD LCD option, but those who want the best viewing experience may not mind the premium. We also recommend you spend a little more and get at least the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM" href="https://bit.ly/3ywh0CO">Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM</a> instead of the meager 4GB that the base model offers.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930</a></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e0b8dc0-df2f-11eb-bbe7-52280094a124"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for an excellent typing experience, look no further than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop 4" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Surface Laptop 4</a>. Microsoft has killed it with the keyboards on its recent Surface Laptops and this one’s no different. Though they’re not as deep and springy as ThinkPads, the buttons here are deliciously responsive and have ample travel. The roomy trackpad is solid, too.</p><p>Of course, it’s important that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-4-review-2021-bigger-better-ultraportable-133047360.html">Surface Laptop 4</a> deliver on everything else, or we wouldn’t recommend it. The 15-inch version that we tested offered breezy performance, respectable battery life and a lovely 3:2 Pixelsense screen which supports Microsoft’s Surface Pen input. Though its design is a little staid, the Surface Laptop 4 still has a clean, professional design and a luxurious aluminum case that&#39;s sturdy enough to withstand being stuffed in your backpack. Plus, at 3.4 pounds, it won&#39;t burden your shoulders too much.</p><p>The best thing about the Surface Laptop 4 is that its base model, which comes equipped with AMD’s Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of RAM, starts at $1,000. That rivals the Dell XPS 13, making it a better buy for the value-conscious: You get more screen, more power and more RAM for the money. Both the Surface and the XPS are great options, but the latter offers an OLED panel and thinner bezels that make it look more modern.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8391a7b0-df2f-11eb-9fdf-c928301f5bd2"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For those whose priority is light weight, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Book Pro" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Galaxy Book Pro</a> series should be at the top of your list. At just 2.36 pounds for the clamshell and 3.06 pounds for the convertible model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review-price-specs-130006444.html">15-inch Galaxy Book Pro</a> is one of the lightest 15-inch laptops around. It’s also super thin at 0.46 inches thick, and despite its compact size it manages to house three USB-C ports (one of them supporting Thunderbolt 4), a microSD card reader and a headphone jack.</p><p>It also packs an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor and at least 8GB of RAM, along with a 68Whr battery that delivers a similar runtime to the Dell XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4. That’s particularly impressive given the Galaxy Book Pro has a Super AMOLED screen, which offers sumptuous image quality, high contrast ratio and deep blacks. Unfortunately, Samsung is still stuck on a 16:9 aspect ratio, which will feel outdated in a year or two, but it’s not a deal breaker.</p><p>The Galaxy Book Pro’s keyboard isn’t as comfortable as the Surface Laptop 4’s but it’s pleasant enough, and the trackpad is enormous. We’re more concerned about the odd webcam software that makes you look dark and splotchy, so if looking your best on video calls is of concern you might want to consider something else. Plus, the $1,100 base model comes with an Intel Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM and 512 GB of storage, making it a competitive offering against the Dell and Surface laptops. Awful camera aside, there’s plenty to love about the Galaxy Book Pro, especially for those looking to lighten their loads.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999</a></p><h2>Acer Chromebook Spin 713</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f3731fb0-df2e-11eb-997e-b8fa781ff86f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re considering saving a few hundred bucks by opting for Chrome OS, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer Chromebook Spin 713" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWzeYv">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a> might be the right choice. Sure, there are cheaper Chromebooks out there, but it’s one of few machines with a 3:2 aspect ratio and has a utilitarian design that makes it perfect for butterfingers.</p><p>That price also gets you an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and sturdy 360-degree hinge so you can set it up in a variety of modes. The 13.5-inch screen is also more pixel-dense than most 1080p displays of the same size. Though the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">Spin 713</a> only clocked about 8 hours on our battery test, that’s enough to get you through a work day. If $700 feels too expensive for a Chromebook, you could also wait till it inevitably goes on sale to save a bit more.

It’s a 15-inch Windows laptop with an AMD Ryzen 3 3200U processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage that costs between $400 and $450.

At the Game Developers Conference (GDC), it <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/">unveiled</a> a technical demo with an RTX-powered MediaTek ARM processor running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-wolfenstein-youngblood-e3-demo-video.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>NVIDIA showed off real time ray-traced reflections and DLSS on the game using an ARM-based platform for the first time. It also showed off a demo called <em>Bistro</em> (from Amazon&#39;s Lumberyard game engine) running real-time ray-tracing on ARM, with RTX direct illumination (RTXDI) and NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser (NRD) features turned on. The demos ran on a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 ARM-based platform combined with a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c9dc21c047b40eeb74ffd727199a46f"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBfci5hYN1c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA made the tech work by porting several RTX SDKs to ARM devices. Those include deep learning super sampling (DLSS) to boost sharpness, RTX direct illumination, NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser, the RTX memory utility (RTXMU) and RTX global illumination. NVIDIA said that the RTXDI, NRD and RTXMU SDKs for ARM with Linux are now available for developers, with RTXGI and DLSS coming soon.</p><p>Of course, you won&#39;t get to see any of this until manufacturers add RTX hardware to their ARM-based laptops, Chromebooks or other devices. Game manufacturers will also need to implement the tech for ARM-based games. However, both the <em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em> developer and game engine company seem bullish.&nbsp;</p><p>“RTX support for ARM and Linux opens up new opportunities for game developers to provide more immersive experiences on a wider variety of platforms,” said Unity&#39;s senior technical product manager Mathieu Muller. &quot;An iD Tech-based game running on an ARM CPU with ray tracing enabled is a significant step in a journey that will result in many more gaming platforms being available to all game developers,&quot; added Machinegames CTO Jim Kjellin.</p><p>Of course, NVIDIA&#39;s relationship with ARM is set to get a whole lot closer as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-arm-acquisition-softbank-000846113.html">bought the company</a> last year for $40 billion. However, the deal is subject to regulatory approval and NVIDIA rival (and ARM customer) Qualcomm has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">objected</a> to the deal. On top of that, ARM employees 3,000 people in the UK and that country&#39;s regulator is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-cma-investigating-nvidia-arm-acquisition-130504069.html">investigating</a> the sale.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-shows-wolfenstein-youngblood-running-rtx-ray-tracing-on-arm-130037247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c1b8331-66aa-43d0-83f7-db4b277ce035</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626701816</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:37:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An onscreen example of NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Klipsch's newest soundbars offer 8K HDR passthrough and Dolby Atmos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Klipsch has a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-klipsch-soundbars-at-ces-2020.html">futureproof soundbars</a>, and that&#39;s certainly true of its latest models.

Sound quality is noticeably better than previous AirPods models, thanks in part to a built-in amplifier and  Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-range frequencies to your ears. Active noise-cancellation does a good job blocking out surrounding sounds and the earbuds&#39; touch controls let you quickly enter Transparency Mode whenever you need to hear the world around you.</p><p>But the AirPods Pro carved out a spot on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">our favorite wireless earbuds</a> list because of how easy they are to use with other Apple products. The H1 chip inside allows them to pair and switch easily between iPhones, iPads and Macs, so you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac pretty seamlessly. We also like their hands-free Siri feature, which lets you call upon the voice assistant without tapping the earbuds.</p><p>AirPods Pro are one of the best pairs of earbuds you can get if you live in the Apple ecosystem — but there are other options, too.

Ocado — which competes with Amazon Fresh — has been forced to cancel orders for some customers after a robot collision sparked a fire at its warehouse in south-east London.

Nonetheless, the London Fire Brigade was called to the scene to deal with the blaze, the company added. In all, Ocado said the damage was limited to just 1 percent of its grid, adding that it would take a week for the facility to resume operations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UK company&#39;s south-east London warehouse contains 3,000 robots that move at 13 feet per second when fetching grocery orders. Ocado also licenses its automation platform to others including <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/our-solutions/our-global-partners/kroger">Kroger</a> in the US, which recently deployed the system at its 375,000-square-foot customer fulfillment center in Monroe, Ohio.</p><p>Based on the proximity of the droids and the speedy nature of their task, it&#39;s a miracle more clashes haven&#39;t occurred.

The move will allow Zoom to expand into call center technology worth up to $24 billion, diversifying its products once employees start returning to the office after the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom when the deal is closed, likely in the first half of 2022. &quot;We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more... value to our customers,” Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9">statement</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c177944b73d41fca343446a8ad80528"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting news! 🎉 We have signed an agreement to acquire <a href="https://twitter.com/Five9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Five9</a>.

Zoom notes that it was already a &quot;long-term&quot; customer of Five9 and said the partnership will give Five9&#39;s business clients access to Zoom products like the multi-platform <a href="https://zoom.us/zoom-phone-features">Zoom Phone</a> app.</p><p>The acquisition won&#39;t have much of an impact on consumers, as Five9 is largely a business-to-business company. However, Zoom&#39;s recent growth has been fueled in part by employees needing to work and communicate from home due to the pandemic. Once that crisis eases, Five9&#39;s contact center business will provide another revenue stream.</p><p>While most of its products are aimed at businesses, Zoom has also embraced the consumer side of things. Last year, the company released a new category of products called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-for-home-130020632.html">Zoom for Home</a>, with both software and a line of hardware devices. While those products are aimed at employees working from home, they can also be used by consumers looking for a reliable video calling system.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-acquires-contact-center-company-five9-for-14-7-billion-101956102.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">501cdc0f-b55a-4d1f-a2f5-3d59f704791c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 10:19:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626689998</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T10:20:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tencent to buy British video game studio Sumo for $1.27 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a busy year for gaming mergers, another deal has just been announced.

The OLED Switch replaces the LED display on the original Switch with a 7-inch 720p OLED screen and doubles the storage to 64GB, while adding an ethernet port and improved kickstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-nintendo-could-launch-two-new-switch-consoles-this-year.html">reports</a> also pointed to the possibility of Nintendo launching another console, the Switch Pro, with higher-end components and NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. However, Nintendo also shot down that rumor. &quot;We also want to clarify that we just announced that Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) will launch in October, 2021, and have no plans for launching any other model at this time,&quot; Nintendo added in a follow-up tweet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-denies-it-will-squeeze-more-profit-from-oled-switch-sales-074528512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f686c0e-a56a-459e-8c08-feb69b365d45</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:45:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626680730</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T07:45:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grimes, Will.i.am and Alanis Morrissette will judge an avatar singing TV show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you more comfortable singing behind a virtual persona than you are on a real stage? Your reality TV show has arrived. <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/grimes-alanis-morissette-william-to-judge-new-avatar-singing-competition-tv-show/"><em>Pitchfork</em></a> and <a href="https://www.avclub.com/grimes-is-judging-the-worlds-first-avatar-singing-comp-1847310292"><em>AV Club</em></a> report that Fox is launching a &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; avatar singing competition series, <em>Alter Ego</em>, that will have celebrity judges gather in real life to gauge the performances of amateur singers who use avatars to &quot;reinvent themselves.&quot;</p><p>You&#39;ll likely recognize the judge panel. Canadian artists <a href="https://www.engadget.com/endel-grimes-ai-sleep-soundscape-android-release-110028557.html">Grimes</a> (pictured above) and Alanis Morrissette will join <a href="https://www.engadget.com/will-i-am-xupermask-face-mask-140005760.html">Will.i.am</a> and Nick Lachey in critiquing the music, while Emmy winner Rocsi Diaz will host the affair. <em>Alter Ego</em> debuts sometime in the fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s an unusual concept, but not necessarily a bad one. In theory, this could help budding talent overcome stage fright or self-esteem issues by using an avatar as a stand-in. It&#39;s certainly a fitting show for a tech-savvy artist like Grimes. It&#39;s just a question of whether or not audiences enjoy the concept. Anonymizing music shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fox-tubi-original-shows-151552495.html"><em>The Masked Singer</em></a> have been hits, but they still involve a physical presence for the participants — there&#39;s a chance viewers might not be so thrilled about digital concerts.</p><div id="31285a4b2ef5448abc057d9b7a91d610"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned

including former managers Cecile Cornet (head of human resources), Tommy Francois (editorial VP) and Serge Hascoët (global creative director).

UC Riverside researchers have <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/07/16/air-powered-computer-memory-helps-soft-robot-control-movements">developed</a> pneumatic computer memory that they used to help a soft robot play keyboards.</p><p>Instead of conventional transistors and electric circuits, the &quot;air-powered&quot; memory relies on microfluidic valves that control airflow. Atmospheric pressure in a given valve represents a binary &quot;0,&quot; while a vacuum indicates a &quot;1.&quot; The researchers&#39; memory has a complex-enough array of these valves to function like an 8-bit RAM chip — not exactly powerful, but good enough that a pair of soft robot hands can play &quot;Mary Had a Little Lamb&quot; at a slow but steady pace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The absence of positive pressure makes this particularly safe — there&#39;s no danger of the memory exploding  in mid-use.</p><p>The technology is far from ready for everyday use. Besides needed improvements to complexity and speed, a robot would need soft versions of processors and other components to completely eliminate the need for rigid electronics. The goal is clear, however. Pneumatic memory could at least reduce the need for chips in soft robots, and points to a future of completely flexible robotics that shouldn&#39;t hurt you if there&#39;s a collision.</p><div id="fca6e9ee57884d9c8aad3310d89da23e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnG7ApR5GS0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soft-robot-pneumatic-memory-200149552.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55844c3b-174e-4be8-99fb-bf3764c75fad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 20:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626699251</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T12:55:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b18df780-e7ff-11eb-beff-03a666767e6a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UC Riverside]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Soft robot playing the piano using pneumatic memory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NSO spyware was allegedly used to target activists and journalists]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Critics have previously claimed that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">NSO Group spyware</a> was misued to target the media and other innocent people, but new findings might have revealed the extent of that misuse. The <em>Washington Post</em> has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2021/nso-spyware-pegasus-cellphones/">shared</a> a multi-partner investigation claiming that NSO&#39;s Pegasus software was used to successfully hack 37 phones, including journalists, activists and the two women closest to murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>.</p><p>The victims were on a 2016-era list of 50,000 phone numbers from countries believed to conduct both extensive surveillance and use of NSO tools, such as Hungary and Saudi Arabia. The list included 1,000 people who didn&#39;t obviously fit the software&#39;s intended criminal targets, including over 600 politicians, 189 journalists, 85 humans rights activists and 65 business executives.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roughly a dozen Americans working overseas were on the list, but the investigation partners couldn&#39;t conduct forensic studies on most of their phones or find evidence of successful hacks. NSO previously said Pegasus couldn&#39;t be used to snoop on American devices.</p><p>NSO flatly denied the claims stemming from the investigation. It maintained that the information had &quot;no factual basis,&quot; and rejected the notion that Pegasus was used to target Khashoggi or his associates. It maintained that it shut down access &quot;multiple times&quot; over past abuses, and that the list was too large to be focused solely on numbers its client countries would have targeted. The company went so far as to hire a libel attorney, Thomas Clare, that accused the investigation partners of having &quot;misinterpreted and mischaracterized&quot; data while making &quot;speculative and baseless assumptions.&quot;</p><p>NSO has historically pinned abuse claims on the countries themselves, and has said it reviewed the human rights records of a given nation before doing business.</p><p>The report comes a year and a half after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-30-facebook-sues-nso-group.html">Facebook sued NSO</a> for allegedly enabling call exploit attacks against WhatsApp, and mere months after Citizen Lab claimed that NSO software was used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">hack <em>Al Jazeera</em> journalists&#39; iPhone</a>s using an iMessage flaw. However true the accusations might be, they&#39;ll at least affect NSO&#39;s reputation — they cast doubt on the company&#39;s assertion that it only serves customers pursuing obvious targets like terrorists.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d7dca090-48c2-4ab2-9c43-6cec3a140498</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 19:02:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626634957</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T19:02:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/027ac330-e7ec-11eb-b957-7edb983da2a3" width="5168" height="3352" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/027ac330-e7ec-11eb-b957-7edb983da2a3" width="5168" height="3352" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nazar Abbas Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Internet Censoring.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[More leaks suggest the next iPhone might have an always-on display]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Add another major voice to the chorus of those claiming the next iPhone could have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-2021-always-on-display-223000663.html">always-on display</a>.

However, a past leak from Max Weinbach suggested Apple would use an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panel that, like on the Apple Watch and a few Android phones, could drop to extremely low refresh rates to offer persistent information without a large hit to battery life.

The social media firm <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/">posted</a> a refutation of the allegations, using data to suggest that something other than Facebook was responsible for a slowdown in vaccination rates and a rise in cases.</p><p>The company noted that vaccine acceptance in user polling had risen from 70 percent in January 2021 to as high as 85 percent in July, and that cultural group disparities had declined &quot;considerably&quot; over the same period. This was ahead of Biden&#39;s goal of getting 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July — to Facebook, this was a sign the company was &quot;not the reason&quot; the US fell short of that target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook added that Canada and the UK had higher vaccination percentages despite using the social network about as much as their American counterparts. There&#39;s &quot;more than Facebook&quot; to the US results, the company said. It also pointed to its efforts to both promote <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-covid-19-forecasts-160038962.html">accurate claims</a> and fight falsehoods, including the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-notifications-harmful-coronavirus-misinformation-191233820.html">misinformation labels</a>, reduced exposure and takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet giant didn&#39;t attempt to find an alternate explanation for US troubles. Some observers have <a href="https://twitter.com/NGrossman81/status/1416724328591282176">pointed</a> to a possible link between political affiliation and vaccination rates, but Facebook didn&#39;t even hint at this in its refutal.</p><p>It&#39;s not a flawless argument. Facebook is trying to draw a link between its polling data and the entire US, which doesn&#39;t make for a neat and tidy comparison. The company also hasn&#39;t shared estimates of how much COVID-19 misinformation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">slips through the cracks</a>. The social site has a strong incentive to downplay its possible contribution to the problem given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html">past complaints</a> that it hasn&#39;t done enough to stop misinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the data shifts the attention back to the Biden administration — it may need to provide more substantial data if it&#39;s going to show that health misinformation on social networks like Facebook is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">major threat</a>, as the US Surgeon General recently said. If nothing else, it suggests the answer is a complicated one regardless of how much Facebook is responsible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-rejects-biden-covid-19-misinformation-154349002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a0aa434-f1e1-4b9a-99d1-f045fca245f7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 15:43:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626623031</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T15:44:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenage student receives a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during a vaccination event for local adolescents and adults outside the Bronx Writing Academy school in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 4, 2021.

That said, it&#39;s still a weakness that could be exploited by those especially motivated to infiltrate someone&#39;s computer. Tech companies need to ensure their authentication technologies are secure if they want to rely more and more on biometrics and to move away from passwords as a means of authentication.

Published by Park Row Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Coffee and tea are much more potent sources of caffeine than soda. In one cup of coffee, you are likely to ingest around 100 mg of caffeine, but it can be up to 175 mg with the right coffee beans and technique. The whole process of making coffee beans (and coffee itself) is pretty fascinating if you’ve never given it much thought. For example, espresso makers and percolators get the most caffeine out of lighter roasted beans, but the drip method is the best way to get the most trimethylxanthine from darker beans. However, in general, light and dark roast coffees typically have the same relative number of caffeine molecules in each cup of coffee (excluding espressos).</p><p>Let’s look at the roasting processes to determine why that is. When the beans are initially heated, they absorb energy in what we call an endothermic process. However, at around 175°C (347°F), the process suddenly becomes exothermic. This means that the beans have absorbed so much heat that they now radiate the heat back into the atmosphere of the roasting machine. When this happens, the settings have to be adjusted on the equipment, in order to avoid over-roasting the beans (which sometimes results in burnt-tasting coffee). Some roasters will even toggle the beans between the endothermic and exothermic reaction a couple of times, to achieve different flavors.</p><p>Over time, roasting coffee beans slowly change from green to yellow, and then to a number of different shades of brown. We refer to the darkness of the bean as its “roast,” where the darker roasted coffee beans are much darker in color than the lighter roasted beans (surprise, surprise). Their color comes from the temperature at which they are roasted. Lighter beans are heated to about 200°C (392°F) and darker roasted beans to about 225–245°C (437–473°F).</p><p>But just before the beans start to, for lack of better words, lightly roast, the coffee beans go through their first “crack.” This is an audible process that occurs at 196°C (385°F). During this process, the beans absorb heat and double in size. But since the water molecules evaporate out of the bean when under high temperatures, they actually decrease in mass by about 15%.</p><p>After the first crack, the coffee beans are so dry that they stop readily absorbing heat. Instead, all of the thermal energy is now used to caramelize the sugars on the outside of the coffee bean. This means that the heat is used to break the bonds in the sucrose (sugar) into much smaller (and more fragrant) molecules. The lightest roasts—like cinnamon roast and New England roast—are heated just past the first crack before being removed from the coffee roaster.</p><p>There is a second crack that occurs during the roast, but at a much higher temperature. At 224°C (435°F), the coffee beans lose their structural integrity, and the bean itself starts to collapse. When this happens, you can usually hear it by a second “pop.” Dark roasts are typically categorized by any beans that have been heated past the second crack—like French and Italian roasts. In general, due to the hotter temperatures, darker beans tend to have more of their sugars caramelized, while lighter beans have less. The variation in flavor due to these methods is wild, but it doesn’t really affect how they react in the body— only the taste.</p><p>Once you purchase your perfectly roasted coffee beans, you can do the rest of the chemistry at home. With an inexpensive coffee grinder, you can grind up your coffee beans to a number of different sizes, which will definitely affect the taste of your morning coffee. Small, fine grinds have a lot of surface area, which means the caffeine (and other flavors) can be extracted from the miniaturized coffee beans with ease. However, this can often result in too much caffeine being extracted, which gives the coffee a bitter taste.</p><p>On the other hand, coffee beans can be coarsely ground. In this instance, the insides of the coffee beans are not exposed to nearly the same degree as finely ground coffee beans. The resulting coffee can often taste sour—and sometimes even a little salty. But if you partner up the correct size of coffee grounds with the appropriate brewing method, you can make yourself the world’s best cup of coffee.</p><p>The simplest (and easiest way) to brew coffee is to add extremely hot water to coarse coffee grounds. After they have soaked in the water for a few minutes, the liquid can be decanted from the container. This process, called decoction, uses hot water to dissolve the molecules within the coffee beans. Most current methods of coffee brewing utilize some version of decoction, which is what allows us to drink a cup of warm coffee instead of chomping on some roasted beans. However, since this method does not contain a filtration process, this version of coffee—affectionately referred to as cowboy coffee—is prone to having coffee bean floaters. For that reason, it’s usually not the preferred brewing method.</p><p>By the way, did you notice that I was avoiding the term <em>boiling</em>? If you’re trying to make halfway decent cup of coffee, the hot water should never actually be boiled. Instead, the ideal temperature of the water is around 96°C (205°F), which is just below boiling (100°C, 212°F). At 96°C, the molecules that provide the aroma of coffee begin to dissolve. Unfortunately, when the water is just four degrees hotter, the molecules that give coffee a bitter taste dissolve as well. That’s why coffee nerds and baristas are so obsessed with their water temperature. In my house, we even use an electric kettle that allows us to select whatever temperature we want our water to be.</p><p>Depending on how strong you like your coffee to taste, you may be partial to the French press or another steeping method. Like cowboy coffee, this technique also soaks the coffee grounds in hot water, but these grounds are a little smaller (coarse versus extra coarse). After a few minutes, a plunger is used to push all of the grounds to the bottom of the device. The remaining liquid above the grounds is now perfectly clear and deliciously tasty. Since the coarse coffee grounds are used in this method, more molecules can dissolve in the coffee solution, providing us with a more intense flavor (compared to cowboy coffee).</p><p>Another technique: when hot water is dripped over coffee grounds, the water absorbs the aromatic molecules before dripping into the coffee mug. This process, appropriately called the drip method, can be done manually or with a high-tech machine, like a coffee percolator. But sometimes this technique is used with cold water, which means that the fragrant, aromatic molecules (the ones that give your coffee its distinctive smell) cannot dissolve in the water. The result is called Dutch iced coffee, a drink that is ironically favored in Japan, and takes about two hours to prepare.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-its-elemental-kate-biberdorf-harper-collins-153015871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7577aec-08c0-4596-bd2d-c7bef8b9bceb</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626281241</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T16:56:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nando Martinez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casual young black woman taking a relaxing cup of coffeee in the kitchen at home.
