As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/tesla-owners-could-get-625-each-in-settlement-over-battery-throttling.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes, it said at the time that the update will revise &quot;charge and thermal management settings&quot; on Model S and Model X vehicles to &quot;help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity.&quot; Some Model S owners claimed, however, that the update reduced their maximum battery voltage, prompting them to take Tesla to court. Now, the automaker has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the class action lawsuit filed against it.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the court documents show that the software update affected 1,743 Model S sedans in the US. The voltage limitation was temporary, but the plaintiffs experienced a 10 percent battery reduction for three months and a seven percent reduction lasting for another seven months, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers said. Tesla rolled out the final update that fully corrected the issue in March 2020. Among the affected vehicles, 1,552 had their max battery voltage restored, while 57 vehicles had battery replacements. The settlement documents said that any vehicle still experiencing battery throttling problems would have their maximum voltage restored over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company has agreed to pay $1.5 billion, a huge chunk of that would be used to cover lawyers&#39; fees: Owners are expected to get only $625 each from the settlement. Affected owners in Norway could get a much bigger payday after a court in the country ordered the company to pay them $16,000 each to settle a lawsuit over the same issue. In the US, aside from agreeing to pay up, Tesla has also agreed to provide battery-related diagnostics and notifications for cars under warranty whenever battery repairs may be needed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settle-model-s-battery-throttling-complaints-080705951.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80f56564-f69d-4bd8-ad2b-6c1b9f4f4261</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:07:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627632455</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T08:07:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dish Network is finally offering HBO, Cinemax and HBO Max to its subscribers after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-hbo-dish-att.html">kicking HBO off its network</a> nearly three years ago. It&#39;s the first time Dish subscribers will be able to watch HBO shows like <em>Mare of Easttown</em> and <em>Euphoria</em> since the carriage dispute began on October 31st, 2018. However, the new agreement doesn&#39;t cover Dish subsidiary Sling TV&#39;s distribution of HBO or HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><p>When Dish removed HBO and Cinemax channels, it accused then-parent  AT&amp;T of using HBO as an &quot;economic weapon.&quot; At that time, HBO was only a straight cable station, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-hbo-max.html">AT&amp;T launched HBO Max</a> as a Netflix-like streaming service in July of 2019. With the situation now resolved, Dish becomes the last major pay TV distributor to add HBO Max to its lineup.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The resolution follows a major shakeup with HBO&#39;s parent, WarnerMedia. In May 2021, AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html">announced</a> that it was spinning off that division and merging it with Discovery in a $43 billion deal. That effectively removed a conflict of interest as AT&amp;T is a direct competitor to Dish in the satellite video service provider space. The parties haven&#39;t disclosed the terms of the new agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>With an accord now in pace, Dish customers get a free 10-day free of HBO and Cinemax from Aug. 6-15. Dish users can subscribe to the HBO Max ad-free plan for $12 rather than the regular price of $15 per month for up to 12 months if they act before Oct. 27, 2021. They&#39;ll get HBO Max access on supported devices like iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV and Fire TV, along with live channels including HBO, HBO Family and HBO Signature. Dish TV customers can also get Cinemax for $10 per month.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f26d8c-32d0-4da6-b5ce-92daca0dace4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 06:15:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623117</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:32:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HBO]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-gen Echo Show 5 is back to its lowest price on Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKQk7q">Amazon&#39;s first-gen Echo Show 5</a> dropped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-first-gen-good-deal-081030616.html">down to $45</a> from its original price of $80 ahead of Prime Day back in June. If you missed the chance to get the Alexa-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">smart display</a> at a discount, though, now&#39;s your chance to get one: It&#39;s available for $45 again on Best Buy. That&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the device, even on Amazon, where it&#39;s been selling for around $50 these past months. It&#39;s also $40 cheaper than the second-gen Echo Show 5, which isn&#39;t that much different from the first-generation device anyway.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKQk7q">Buy Amazon first-gen Echo Show 5 at Best Buy - $45</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review</a> for the newer smart display, the changes are pretty minor. The second-gen Echo Show 5 has a 2-megapixel camera instead of a one-megapixel, and it comes in a light blue color in addition to black and white. However, it still has a much lower resolution than the Echo Show 8, and it doesn&#39;t support a lot of the bigger smart display&#39;s capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re not bothered with the one-megapixel camera difference and the lack of an extra color option, you can just get the first-gen Echo Show 5. Its 5.5-inch screen has the same 960 x 480 resolution as its newer counterpart, it has a fabric-wrapped speaker and it has several clock faces to choose from. The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, so you can use it to watch shows, as well as to display images and videos.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find its screen too small for serious bingeing, though, you can also use it as an alarm clock with several clock faces to choose from. It even comes with a sunrise feature, which slowly brightens the screen fifteen minutes prior to your alarm time to mimic the effects of daylight&#39;s arrival. While the device isn&#39;t available in blue like its newer sibling, you can get either the &quot;Charcoal&quot; (black) or the &quot;Sandstone&quot; (white) color options for $45 on Best Buy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fd9c80-4dd5-4c68-86b9-fca5eaff7a1a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 04:45:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627617919</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T04:05:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After making a return to the mid-range with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">RX 6700 XT GPU</a>, AMD has launched its 1080p flagship, the RX 6600 XT. A successor to the excellent and popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-amd-radeon-rx-5600-xt-review.html">RX 5600 XT card</a>, the new model has considerably more power on tap with 9.6 teraflops of RDNA 2 performance, compared to 7.19 teraflops for the last model. Not only that, but it offers 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, compared to 6GB for its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the RX 6600 XT seems to deliver about the same amount of performance as the RX 5700 XT (9.75 teraflops) and just slightly less than the GPU in the PS5, at least on paper. Since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-radeon-rx-5700-xt-review.html">RX 5700 XT</a> was offered as a 1440p-capable card (and the PS5 can handle 4K), it doesn&#39;t seem a stretch to say that the new model will at least be decent at 1440p gaming.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, AMD is marketing this card as a &quot;new standard for 1080p,&quot; saying that it has up to a 1.7 times uplift over the last generation for games like <em>Doom Eternal</em> for 1080p gaming. AMD noted that around two-third of monitors shipped are still 1080p, so that&#39;s still the norm for PC gaming.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0dab64e0-f0e7-11eb-a8bf-0e4bf50147f5" alt="AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU" data-uuid="a892f838-20c5-3201-96ee-cbd67724e6f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>Other specs include 32 compute units (compared to 40 on the RX 6700 XT), a 2359 MHz game clock and 160W power consumption with a single 8 pin power connector.  AMD also touts custom features like Radeon Boost for higher frame rates and Radeon Anti-Lag for improved latency.</p><p>The main new feature with the 6000-series GPUs, however, is ray-tracing. That feature allows for higher resolutions (1440p and 4K) while still maintaining decent frame rates and allowing for more realistic images. Don&#39;t expect too much from the RX 6600 XT, however, as the RX 6700 XT struggled in ray-tracing tests compared to NVIDIA rivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">in our review</a> — and the RX 6600 XT has lower specs all around.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it looks pretty impressive otherwise for a budget-level 1080p card. We&#39;ll soon see a raft of RX 6600 XT models from ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI (above), ASRock and others, with MSRP starting at $379 and shipping set for August 11th. Take it as a miracle if you get one at that price, though — the RX 5600 XT had a suggested retail of $300, but street prices were often double that and more thanks to the cryptomining and the global GPU shortage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-gpu-designed-for-1080-p-gaming-033049778.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">830515a6-3b84-40b3-a8ec-a033a2741c73</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 03:30:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623768</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:43:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IBM's AI can predict how Parkinson's disease may progress in individuals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past, we’ve seen doctors use AI software to detect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-penn-medicine-brain-tumor-ai-151105509.html">brain tumors</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-deepmind-ai-illness-prediction-veterans-affairs.html">kidney illness</a> and various<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-01-googles-ai-can-detect-breast-cancer-more-accurately-than-expert.html"> cancers</a>.

Starting today with a small group of about two dozen artists, Adobe is allowing creators to offer access to premium projects, live streams and source files <a href="https://medium.com/behance-blog/25-creatives-to-subscribe-to-on-behance-4fc02fb3e8ee">in exchange for a monthly fee</a>. The company says creators can set their own subscription price, and it’s up to them to decide what people get in return for their financial support. You’ll see prompts to support creators throughout the platform, including when you watch live streams.</p><p>For Adobe, obviously this is another way for the company to monetize one of its products beyond its Creative Cloud subscriptions and standalone software offerings.

Guns? Check. Strafing? Yep. Ammo drops in strategic yet predictable locations? You betcha.</p><p>A sneezing system? Uh, sure. Noxious green clouds that follow you when you&#39;re smelly, giving away your location? Um.

He&#39;s known for developing clever first-person action and puzzle games including <em>Gravity Bone</em>, <em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> and <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, and visually, <em>Skin Deep</em> fits perfectly into his repertoire. The only difference is the gun.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d never done one where you just have a gun and you straight-up shoot people,&quot; Chung said. &quot;I thought, you know what? This is something that I love. This is a game genre that has been so important to me for a long time... This is kind of my attempt at making a bunch of little things that I like in first-person shooter games, and putting them into a game that I think will be funny.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f70-f004-11eb-baeb-878e1cb0b4db" alt="Skin Deep" data-uuid="c3ae6c97-5da6-3774-b375-dc0687e237f2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>Chung started coding back in elementary school, when he would spend hours between classes customizing levels in FPS classics <em>Doom </em>and <em>Quake</em>, and he continued modding as titles like<em> Half-Life</em>,<em> Quake 2 </em>and <em>Doom 3</em> hit the scene. He got a job at a mainstream studio in Los Angeles, but continued working on his own projects and eventually went fully independent, picking up a handful of accolades in the process.</p><p>Despite a deep personal connection to the FPS genre, Chung hasn&#39;t released a shooter of his own — but that&#39;s going to change <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301280/Skin_Deep/">when <em>Skin Deep</em> hits Steam</a>. The actual release date is still up in the air, a fact that may be concerning for anyone who remembers waiting for <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>, a game that was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-29-quadrilateral-cowboy.html">six months away</a>&quot; for well over three years. (On the <a href="https://blendogames.com/skindeep/faq.htm"><em>Skin Deep FAQ</em></a> page, one of the Qs reads, &quot;Is <em>Skin Deep</em> going to take 4+ years of development time like your previous game <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>?&quot; and the accompanying answer is, &quot;I hope not.&quot;)</p><p>Regardless of a release date, today publisher Annapurna Interactive showed off a new trailer for <em>Skin Deep</em>. A new, extra-smelly trailer.</p><p><em>Skin Deep</em> is a non-linear espionage shooter set on a spaceship and played from the perspective of an armed, cryogenically frozen insurance agent whose job is to protect the vessel from invading space pirates. The game looks lighthearted yet sophisticated, in classic Blendo fashion; it involves shooting, sneaking and solving puzzles, and all of it is animated in Chung&#39;s signature cubist style. This ties back to FPS history, too —  <a href="https://blendogames.com/skindeep/faq.htm"><em>Skin Deep</em> and most of Blendo Games&#39; titles</a> are built on a modified port of the <em>Doom 3</em> engine, idTech4.</p><section data-eng-breakout="703d85befe0d416d8ef39b45f407f73a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfd89d0-f004-11eb-b6d4-dcb7f8fe25b3" alt="Skin Deep"></section><p>&quot;I&#39;ve played like a bazillion FPS games because I just really enjoy them, but I feel like there&#39;s so much that can be explored and that I wish these games would explore,&quot; Chung said.</p><p>One of the many odd mechanics in <em>Skin Deep</em> is a sneezing function that appears in particularly dusty or peppery environments.</p><p>&quot;If you&#39;re crawling through a dusty vent your little sneezy air level will increase, then you&#39;ll do a big sneeze noise,&quot; Chung said. &quot;And there&#39;s a bag of pepper that we have. If you shoot it, a big cloud of pepper flies out. You can pick up a pepper bag and throw it at someone and they&#39;ll start sneezing.&quot;</p><p>And then there&#39;s the odor system, which leaves literal clouds of stink behind the player, alerting the space pirates and generally causing problems. There&#39;s logic to this system: The player becomes smelly only once they&#39;re expelled from the space ship&#39;s trash chute, fish bones and all, and then they climb back aboard. The smell clouds disappear once the player figures out how to wash up. All of this falls under a mission titled, <em>Protocol 832: Being Smelly And What To Do About It</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0d478b20-f004-11eb-b3cd-83afef1c7053" alt="Skin Deep" data-uuid="26eff69a-fcc3-34eb-a77d-8f0a7d7d8625"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>&quot;I love it when games just do things that you don&#39;t expect,&quot; Chung said. &quot;Like for me, one of the big games that was important for me back in the day was <em>Far Cry 2</em>, back in 2008. That game did so much cool stuff for the first-person genre that was not technologically advanced, but they just made design choices that were just interesting and funny. Like you had this map that you had to pull out but it didn&#39;t pause, and you had to look at a map while getting shot at with guns. And so I thought, there&#39;s so much space to do stuff like that. Why not make people smelly?&quot;</p><p>All of Chung&#39;s games are part of the same cinematic universe, so to speak, and <em>Skin Deep</em> is closely tied to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/55000/Flotilla/"><em>Flotilla</em></a>, a space-based battleship game he published in 2010.</p><p>&quot;They all kind of talk to each other, they all kind of share characters,&quot; Chung said. &quot;We&#39;re still figuring out details, but right now the character that we&#39;re playing as in this game is the character from a game I made before called <em>Flotilla</em>. It&#39;s fun to make these little connections between the different games and have them all kind of share things between them.&quot;</p><p>There&#39;s no word on which of Chung&#39;s future projects will receive the smell clouds from <em>Skin Deep</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skin-deep-brendon-chung-new-fps-steam-annapurna-192141277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce053a3d-b835-4ac4-8594-7af85c9b95dc</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 19:21:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627586502</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T19:22:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f71-f004-11eb-ac8f-ce31ef27fcfa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0cfc9f71-f004-11eb-ac8f-ce31ef27fcfa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skin Deep]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skin Deep]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Solar Ash' brings surreal 3D platforming to PC, PS4 and PS5 on October 26th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a kid, Alx Preston spent a significant amount of time as a member of the audience, watching his brother sing in choir and opera groups. One night, he found himself sitting in a pew at the heart of a large, elegant church, letting the sounds of yet another performance wash over him. He was tired. He also happened to be playing a lot of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> at home.</p><p>“I kind of fell into a dream state,” Preston said. “I was playing a lot of <em>Ocarina of Time</em> at the time, and so the vocals of that mixed with this kind of fantastical vision of going through a forest. I think for me that <em>Ocarina of Time</em> was one of those formative games that really allowed me to see what was possible within the medium.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Preston was the creative energy behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-20-hyper-light-drifters-combat-mode-is-beautifully-punishing.html"><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em></a>, a pixelated 2D title that helped define a generation of neon-coated indie hits in the mid-2010s, and he’s the founder of LA-based studio Heart Machine. He and a growing team of developers have been working on their sophomore release, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solar-ash-heart-machine-gameplay-trailer-ps5-235831251.html"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, since late 2016. It’s a third-person, 3D game set in a dreamlike sci-fi space called the Ultravoid.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66732220-f00b-11eb-adc3-636b0ffae283" alt="Solar Ash" data-uuid="c0d8d151-c804-351b-828d-9e95f5d9bdd3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>To put it in terms of Zelda titles, <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>is <em>A Link to the Past</em>, and <em>Solar Ash</em> is <em>Ocarina of Time</em>.</p><p>“[<em>Ocarina of Time</em>] was really the game that felt so much bigger and limitless in its scope and scale and adventures,” Preston said. “It built a believable world that I could live in and it was 3D, and so of course I always had some idea I might jump into 3D.”</p><p>Today, publisher Annapurna Interactive announced <em>Solar Ash</em> will hit PC and PlayStation platforms on October 26th, five years after Heart Machine began working on it.</p><div id="8f044e02a8be4f2dadab32e9e2126420"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/
1xC9uHfgzwU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>“<em>Hyper Light</em> was a way for me to get started, it was a way for me to be more grounded and put together a crew and understand, can I do this? Can I actually make games?” Preston said. “And so having answered that question, then the natural next step for me was something in 3D. Can I put something out there that really opens up the world and makes you feel like you can truly escape into something, a creation that is otherworldly, that you otherwise wouldn&#39;t have the experience of? A lot of my childhood was spent escaping into those bigger experiences.”</p><p><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> was a deliciously difficult 2D action RPG, and at first glance, <em>Solar Ash</em> looks like the third-person, 3D interpretation of that same game world. It’s bright and ethereal, with an emphasis on massive enemies and rapid-fire mechanics. The protagonist, Rei, is a slender assassin on a journey to save her home from the Ultravoid, a supermassive black hole hungry for whole planets.</p><p>Even though it’s 3D, <em>Solar Ash</em> looks so similar to <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> that Preston has had to clarify whether it’s a sequel a few times over. To be clear, it’s not. But to be fair, Preston has personally contributed to the confusion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/666bcf20-f00b-11eb-bd7f-3d9861bd889d" alt="Solar Ash" data-uuid="7984d4c8-d690-3ddf-b2e6-036f0d4b16f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>“I did ambiguously say it&#39;s in the same universe,” Preston said. “Not like Marvel Cinematic Universe, but literally in <em>a universe</em>. So a million galaxies away, technically sure. It&#39;s still in a universe. So it&#39;s kind of a goof way of saying it. I would say that there are connected threads between the games, because I am who I am as a creator, as an artist... but it&#39;s its own game, it&#39;s its own identity in many ways. It&#39;s not trying to say ‘I&#39;m a sequel’ or anything like that to <em>Drifter</em>.”</p><p><em>Solar Ash</em> is an action platformer with Heart Machine’s DNA baked into its code. It doesn’t attempt to do too much, and the team instead has focused on implementing a handful of core mechanics and making them feel as perfect as possible. <em>Solar Ash</em> is filled with radioactive environments and grotesque enemies, and it&#39;s all about fluidity and agility, surfing through the ruins of lost civilizations at the center of a black hole.</p><p>There are <a href="https://heartmachine.com/team">about 25 people</a> on the <em>Solar Ash</em> team, including <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> and <em>It Follows</em> composer Rich Vreeland, otherwise known as Disasterpeace. That’s a bigger dev team than the original <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> crew, but then again, <em>Solar Ash</em> is a bigger game.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7c7fbf560f9640ceba435226dc798c16" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/667210b0-f00b-11eb-bfeb-9d25a1ec7b84" alt="Solar Ash"></section><p>“For <em>Drifter </em>and for <em>Solar Ash</em>, there are similar threads of really focusing on the core elements that are impactful and getting as much mileage out of those as we possibly can,” Preston said. “Because we have a small team making a big-ass project, and the team has been excellent in carrying through on everything that we could. Everyone&#39;s done incredible heavy lifting and worn a lot of different hats, as you have to do on this scale of team, for this scale of project.”</p><p>As Heart Machine’s second game, there’s a lot riding on <em>Solar Ash</em>. Preston has established his brand as an innovative, thoughtful developer, and <em>Solar Ash</em> is his chance to defend it — not only in the court of public opinion, but in his own mind.</p><p>“Audience expectation absolutely factors into it, but for me I&#39;m my own worst critic,” Preston said. “Like any artist, like any creative person, you hate your own work until you don&#39;t and then you let it go. I mostly focused on, how do we feel we&#39;re succeeding internally? Rather than, what is the audience going to expect out of that? Or, what kind of score will you get on Metacritic?”</p><p>Of course, if<em> Solar Ash</em> ends up feeling like a trippy sci-fi extrapolation of <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, it should be a success on all fronts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/solar-ash-release-date-ps4-ps5-epic-games-store-october-191727611.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e0351e-f38e-4e6f-9e82-ca0aadd90afa</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 19:17:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627586247</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T19:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6670d830-f00b-11eb-a9e7-3571855eb7fc" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6670d830-f00b-11eb-a9e7-3571855eb7fc" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Solar Ash]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Solar Ash]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jason Schwartzman plays a floating brain in musical adventure 'The Artful Escape']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Artful Escape </em>is an idealized vision of everything the music industry could be, straight out of the brain of Australian rockstar Johnny Galvatron.

However, for the past few years, Galvatron has been a game developer first and foremost. In the 2010s, he used YouTube videos to teach himself how to create a game in Unreal, building off the 3D animation and coding courses he took back in college, right before Warner Music signed him. He then <a href="http://bnd.studio/">founded a studio</a>, rented some office space, secured a deal with Annapurna, and somewhere along the way, he ended up in a recording booth with Jason Schwartzman.</p><p>&quot;We just hung out and spoke about David Bowie and Bob Dylan and video games and stuff,&quot; Galvatron said. &quot;And it was just like, it was a moment for me.

Johansson claims that the move constituted a breach of contract, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-over-black-widow-streaming-release-11627579278"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> reports.</p><p>In the suit, Johansson says <em>Black Widow</em> was supposed to be released exclusively in theaters, per her deal with Marvel. As is often the case for movie stars, a large portion of Johansson&#39;s salary was tied to its box office success.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To watch <em>Black Widow </em>on Disney+, viewers need to fork over $30 for a Premier Access pass. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html"><ins>Disney initially estimated</ins></a> that the film generated $60 million in revenue on Disney+ from its opening weekend earlier this month, along with $80 million in domestic and $78 million international theatrical revenue.</p><p>The move may have impacted <em>Black Widow</em>&#39;s performance in theaters (though it&#39;s worth bearing in mind that many cinemas around the globe are still closed amid the pandemic). The total worldwide box office tally is currently $319 million. As <a href="https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1420807381529755648"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> points out, that puts it on track to become one of the lowest-grossing Marvel movies to date. Only one of the six other Marvel movies released since early 2018 has made less than $1 billion in theaters.</p><p>Johansson&#39;s representatives tried to re-negotiate her deal after news emerged about the new <em>Black Widow </em>release strategy, the suit says, but Disney and Marvel were allegedly unresponsive. Releasing <em>Black Widow </em>on Disney+ simultaneously could cost Johansson over $50 million, according to a <em>WSJ </em>source.</p><p>In 2019, before COVID-19 changed everything and with Disney+ on the horizon, Johansson and her team contacted Marvel for confirmation that <em>Black Widow</em> would still be a theatrical-only release. According to an email from March 2019 that&#39;s cited in the filing, Marvel&#39;s chief counsel Dave Galluzzi confirmed that. “We understand that should the plan change, we would need to discuss this with you and come to an understanding as the deal is based on a series of (very large) box office bonuses,” the email states.</p><p>Movie theaters around the world were forced to close their doors following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Distributors scrambled to revamp their release strategies. Warner Bros. has adopted a hybrid format this year, with its movies coming to both theaters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html"><ins>HBO Max on the same day</ins></a> (aka day-and-date releases). It will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html"><ins>return to theater-first releases</ins></a> next year.</p><p>However, that approach was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-director-denis-villeneuve-slam-att-warner-hbo-max-162021581.html">criticized by prominent directors</a>, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-vs-christopher-nolan-and-legendary-052202138.html">Christopher Nolan</a>. Warner Bros. owner WarnerMedia reworked some deals and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-hbo-max-bosss-script-for-a-new-hollywood-11621008116"><ins>reportedly</ins></a> paid creative talent who were due a cut of box office revenue north of $200 million. NBCUniversal also released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-boss-baby-sequel-date-and-date-streaming-theatrical-082708339.html"><em><ins>The Boss Baby: Family Business</ins></em></a> in theaters and on Peacock on the same day.</p><p>Disney adopted different tactics. Several of the movies it has released day-and-date (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-release-182440824.html"><em><ins>Mulan</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-raya-and-the-last-dragon-pre-order-152903422.html"><em><ins>Raya and the Last Dragon</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-may-stream-peter-pan-pinocchio-cruella-movies-174557320.html"><em><ins>Cruella</ins></em></a>) were initially locked behind that $30 pass on Disney+. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-artemis-fowl-june-12-052950143.html"><em><ins>Artemis Fowl</ins></em></a>, and Pixar movies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em><ins>Soul</ins></em></a> and <em>Luca </em>skipped theaters entirely in many countries and went straight to Disney+ as part of the regular library.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9c05c0b4-0e62-41d3-8031-425b338cc447</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 18:33:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627583623</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T18:33:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4972c420-f09a-11eb-9cae-ab74e3c108c9" width="3100" height="2306" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4972c420-f09a-11eb-9cae-ab74e3c108c9" width="3100" height="2306" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Actress Scarlett Johansson wears a Versace gown as she arrives at the 87th Academy Awards in Hollywood, California February 22, 2015.

In <a href="https://apnews.com/article/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-interview-6d6104eaaa8e6e53e99e1cbe55cca480">an interview</a> with the <em>AP</em>, CEO Vlad Tenev said that, eventually, he wants to turn Robinhood into “the single money app” his users need.</p><p>Though Tenev didn’t use the word “bank,” his description certainly sounds more like a bank than the current iteration of Robinhood.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Over time, we want to be the single money app, the most trusted and most culturally relevant money app worldwide. So, everything that you use your money for, you should be able to do through Robinhood.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Anytime you receive a paycheck direct deposit, we’d like you to do that through Robinhood. Your emergency fund, your bill pay, your day-to-day spending, we’d like for customers to use us for that. And of course, all types of investing ranging from more discretionary investing to long-term retirement savings as well.</p></blockquote><p>Tenev didn’t elaborate on exactly how these plans could take shape. And though it’s not necessarily surprising the company would want to expand the types of services it offers, the CEO’s comments will likely raise more than a few eyebrows.</p><p>The app, which became popular for its simple interface and commission-free trading, has also drawn criticism for many of its practices.

When you complete a speed test, the app will share that information with Airbnb and <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/about/">M-Lab</a>, the organization that provided Airbnb the open-source software the company used to build the tool.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a <a href="https://www.airbnb.ca/help/article/3003/verify-your-internet-speed?locale=en&amp;_set_bev_on_new_domain=1627574592_ZGViZGM0ZTY4OWIx"><ins>support document</ins></a> from the company, M-Lab will include your test results in a publicly available database it provides for internet researchers. More importantly, those who want to stay at your home or accommodation will see if your WiFi connection is suited to their needs. It should also help ensure listings have accurate estimates.</p><p>Airbnb considers anything above a consistent 7 Mbps as a “snappy” connection. “Guests can hang with family and friends on a video call or gather together to stream a rom-com,” the company says on its website. Airbnb has started rolling out the WiFi tool to hosts in the US, with global availability to follow in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airbinb-wifi-speed-test-tool-host-listings-171011280.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b487914d-4fff-4fcb-aba4-376388aeca27</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 17:10:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627578616</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T17:10:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel Organizations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d48f53f0-f08d-11eb-b7d9-520dcb5e2203" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d48f53f0-f08d-11eb-b7d9-520dcb5e2203" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Airbnb]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbnb WiFi tool]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airbnb WiFi tool]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nikola founder Trevor Milton indicted on fraud charges]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns-sec-investigation-080431364.html">Trevor Milton</a>, the founder and former executive chairman of electric vehicle company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nikola">Nikola</a>, has been charged with two counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud by a federal grand jury.

He&#39;s also accused of falsely claiming that Nikola had developed &quot;game-changing&quot; battery technology, that it was developing and making several key components for its EVs in-house and that &quot;the total cost of ownership of Nikola&#39;s trucks was 20-30 percent below that of diesel vehicles.&quot;</p><p>Prosecutors claim Milton, who resigned in September in the face of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikola-ev-short-selling-012546201.html">a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe</a>, targeted and misled amateur investors (or &quot;retail investors&quot;).
