If the rules come into force, advertisers would have to provide clear details on the criteria they use for targeting, as well as the &quot;amplification tools or methods&quot; they harness.</p><p>Every ad would also have to be more transparent in terms of displaying the name of the person or organization that paid for it, as well as disclosing how much was spent, where the money came from and the ad&#39;s connection to an election or referendum.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EC is hoping these measures will help protect election integrity, largely by making it more difficult for campaigns to target and mislead marginalized groups. It said people should be able to easily tell when they see a paid political ad, whether online or offline, and take part in political discussions without being impacted by interference, manipulation or misinformation.</p><div id="2fe9eb865ecf4fd085f4db02e7d71b51"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8ZRgIXyG2g?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Elections must not be a competition of opaque and non-transparent methods. People must know why they are seeing an ad, who paid for it, how much, what micro-targeting criteria were used,&quot; the EC&#39;s vice-president for values and transparency Vera Jourová said in a statement.</p><p>If the bill becomes law, EU member states will need to determine fines for breaching the rules. National data protection authorities will be tasked with monitoring how personal data is used in ad targeting and imposing fines when appropriate. The EC is hoping to enact the rules, which build on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr/"><ins>General Data Protection Regulation</ins></a> and planned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-digital-markets-act-digital-services-act-social-media-big-tech-193853473.html"><ins>Digital Services Act</ins></a>, by spring 2023, ahead of European Parliament elections the following year.</p><p>Political ads have been a hot button issue for online platforms for several years. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-polls-close-election-night-215455707.html"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-election-ad-ban-173317034.html"><ins>Google</ins></a> both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-election-ad-bans-170654929.html"><ins>temporarily banned them</ins></a> after polls closed in the 2020 US presidential election to stem the flow of misinformation. Earlier this month, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-removes-sensitive-topic-ad-targeting-222436773.html"><ins>removed</ins></a> thousands of ad targeting options, including those related to ethnicity, health, religion, sexual orientation and political beliefs. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-twitter-details-political-ad-ban.html"><ins>banned all political ads</ins></a> in 2019.</p><p>The EC&#39;s proposed rules could also prevent some types of surreptitious data collection.

This has been a trend for the past few years — if you happen to be online and searching for Black Friday deals a few hours before the day arrives, you can expect at least a handful of solid early sales. And that strategy may pay off this year even more than others as supply chain issues continue to push back shipping estimates. The sooner you grab the items on your gift list, the better the chance they&#39;ll arrive on time.

The rules will ban easy-to-guess default passwords, require disclosure of security update release dates and more — under penalty of hefty fines.&nbsp;</p><p>The new rules were originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-uk-proposes-tougher-security-for-smart-home-devices.html">proposed last year</a>, following a long period of consultation, and are largely unchanged. The first one is a ban on easy-to-guess default passwords, including classics like &quot;password&quot; and &quot;admin.&quot; All passwords that come with new devices will &quot;need to be unique and not resettable to any universal factory setting,&quot; the law states.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Most of us assume if a product is for sale, it’s safe and secure. Yet many are not, putting too many of us at risk of fraud and theft,&quot; said UK Minister Julia Lopez. &quot;Our Bill will put a firewall around everyday tech from phones and thermostats to dishwashers, baby monitors and doorbells, and see huge fines for those who fall foul of tough new security standards.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Next, manufacturers must tell customers at the point of sale and keep them updated about the minimum time requirement for security patches and updates. If the product doesn&#39;t come with them, that fact must be disclosed. Finally, manufacturers must provide a public point of contact for security researchers to they can easily disclose flaws and bugs.</p><p>The government is hoping to curtail attacks on household devices, citing 1.5 billion attempted compromises of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the first half of 2020 alone. As examples, it cited a 2017 attack in which hackers stole data from a casino by attacking an internet-connected fish tank. It added that &quot;in extreme cases, hostile groups have taken advantage of poor security features to access people&#39;s webcams.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The rules will be overseen by a regulator that will be appointed once the bill comes into law. Fines could hit up to £10 million ($13.3 million) or 4 percent of a company&#39;s gross revenue — with up to £20,000 a day levied for ongoing infractions. The law applies not only to manufacturers, but also businesses that import tech products into the UK. Products include smartphones, routers, security cameras, games consoles and home speakers, along with internet-enabled appliances and toys.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-law-imposes-stiff-fines-on-insecure-smart-home-devices-200031873.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dbe43ddd-ff01-420f-8829-c8bb08244f10</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 20:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637847425</ingested><modified>2021-11-25T13:37:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ba8bd280-4df3-11ec-b9dc-c1fbb9fa77df" width="960" height="640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ba8bd280-4df3-11ec-b9dc-c1fbb9fa77df" width="960" height="640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gov.UK]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UK law imposes stiff fines on insecure smart home devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[UK law imposes stiff fines on insecure smart home devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer Black Friday deals include huge discounts for Kishi phone controllers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A ton of Razer accessories <a href="https://amzn.to/3l87523"><ins>are on sale on Amazon</ins></a> for Black Friday, including mice, headsets, keyboards and a gaming chair.

That&#39;s part of the terms the company has agreed to in order to settle the lawsuit filed by its shareholder, the Employees&#39; Retirement System of Rhode Island, for allegedly enabling a culture of discrimination. In addition, it has committed $50 million towards increasing diversity and inclusion within the company.</p><p>The shareholder sued Pinterest after allegations made by former employees Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks became public. In a series of <a href="https://twitter.com/ifeomaozoma/status/1272546213322080258">tweets</a>, Ozoma detailed how she fought for a year to be paid and treated fairly. She said Pinterest responded inadequately when one of her white male colleagues shared her name and phone number to racist/misogynistic parts of the internet. Her colleague reportedly doxxed her after she suggested adding a warning on content from Ben Shapiro, whom she&#39;d described as a &quot;white supremacist.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Banks said her manager made disparaging comments about her ethnicity (she&#39;s Black and Japanese) in front of colleagues. Both Ozoma and Banks said they were paid less than their manager, a white man, despite having similar workloads.&nbsp;</p><p>The Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island argued that by allowing those events to take place, executives perpetrated or knowingly ignored &quot;the long-standing and systemic culture of discrimination and retaliation at Pinterest.&quot; Thus, they breached their fiduciary duty. Rhode Island General Treasurer Seth Magaziner said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We pushed for these sweeping reforms to support Pinterest&#39;s employees with a fair and safe workplace, and to strengthen the company&#39;s brand and performance by ensuring that the values of inclusiveness are made central to Pinterest&#39;s identity.&quot;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>As <em>NBC News</em> notes, the fact that Pinterest agreed to release employees from their NDAs reflects the work Ozoma has accomplished since she left the company. She co-sponsored the Silenced No More Act that will make it easier for workers to speak out about racism and harassment in the workplace even if they had previously signed NDAs. California Gov. Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/silenced-no-more-act-becomes-law-in-california-crippling-ndas-11633705395">signed it into law</a> in October, and it will be enforced starting on January 1st.&nbsp;</p><p>Ozoma and Banks aren&#39;t the only former employees who spoke out against Pinterest. Former COO Françoise Brougher also said that she was fired after she told CEO Ben Silbermann that she was being given gendered feedback and was being paid less than her male counterparts. She <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-employees-are-staging-a-walkout-following-discrimination-allegations-103221891.html">sued</a> the company last year and settled for $22.5 million.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-discrimination-cases-nda-180009014.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d058ee6-0849-48c1-899a-e38c195be337</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 18:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637841582</ingested><modified>2021-11-25T11:59:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banking & Budgeting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/8f74e9b0-d35b-11ea-966b-84b9af737d47" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/8f74e9b0-d35b-11ea-966b-84b9af737d47" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chayantorn via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chonburi, Thailand - January 01, 2018 : Apple iPhone 8 Plus showing Pinterest application on mobile.

One of our favorites is Ableton Live and it’s currently on sale for Black Friday. Until Monday, November 29th, you can get <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/">25 percent off all of the company’s music-making software</a>. That includes all three tiers of Ableton Live 11. The “Intro” tier currently costs $74, down from its usual price of $99, while the “Standard” and “Suite” versions are priced at $337 and $562 at the moment. Abelton has also reduced the cost of Standard and Suite upgrades by 25 percent. You can also get that same discount on <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/"><ins>packs</ins></a>.</p><p>We’ve seen Ableton offer a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-30-percent-deal-171004451.html"><ins>30 percent discount</ins></a> on its software a couple of times in the past, but it doesn’t do so frequently. Students and teachers can get Ableton Live 11 for 40 percent off. If you don’t fall in that category, this may be the best deal you can get on the DAW for the foreseeable future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it comes to audio production tools, Ableton Live is one of our favorites, particularly after the recent version <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html"><ins>11 update</ins></a>. The interface can be intimidating at first, but once you learn to find your way around, you’ll discover that it will encourage you to experiment. If you want to try the software before you commit any money, Ableton offers a <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/trial/"><ins>90-day trial</ins></a>.

We consider it to be the best high-end streaming box, and right now it&#39;s on sale for $160, which is one of the better prices we&#39;ve seen. Amazon has the device for $169, but an automatically applied coupon will knock the price down to $160 at checkout.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3CQzZd4" id="3d86560112d14097af3457a83272b476" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple TV 4K at Amazon - $160</a><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">modestly upgraded</a> its set-top box this year with the biggest improvement being the new Siri remote. The previous remote that came with the Apple TV 4K was clunky to use, but this new model is a huge improvement. It&#39;s larger and has a touch-sensitive directional pad that makes it much easier to swipe and scroll between content on your screen. It&#39;s reminiscent of the iPod scrollwheel of yesteryear, and that&#39;s a good thing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re familiar with the previous generation Apple TV 4K, you may not notice too much of a difference when it comes to performance. The new model has an A12 Bionic chip that helps the gadget run smoothly, and we appreciate its support for Dolby Vision at 60 fps, Dolby Atmos sound and AirPlay 3. This model even supports HomeKit, so you can ask Siri to show you things like video camera feeds and they&#39;ll pop up right on your TV screen. We also found Siri to be quite useful for executing entertainment commands like &quot;show me Christmas movies&quot; or &quot;play the latest episode of Ted Lasso.&quot;</p><p>The biggest drawback to the Apple TV 4K is price — it&#39;s normally $180, so it&#39;s worthwhile to wait for the (rare) sales in which it drops even slightly lower than that. But it&#39;s by no means the only streaming box out there — we also like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Ultra" href="https://amzn.to/3cOxnBO">Roku Ultra</a> and, even though it&#39;s not technically a box, the latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Chromecast with Google TV" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/JrOeNq">Chromecast with Google TV</a> is another solid option that also has an updated, handy remote.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

A doomed pairing of the most lucrative recent gaming phenomenon with one of the most storied video-game franchises spanning over 30 years? I love Final Fantasy, mostly. I’m lukewarm on Fortnite and the battle royale format in general. With<em> Metroid Dread, Shin Megami Tensei, Alan Wake Remastered</em> and <em>Deathloop</em> on my to-do list, why am I still glued to a free-to-play mobile game?</p><div id="d2940b71541d48fc8f5787604cc3e90f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IKgj5K0AYNw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Probably because it’s expanding the already very-expanded Final Fantasy VII universe. The game that got the sequel CGI movie, the remake, multiple mobile games and more. And yet, barring a smart intro movie that cribs from the opening scenes of FF7R, you won’t see the protagonists (or antagonists) of the iconic RPG — though you’ll be able to cosplay as them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <em>First Soldier</em>, you play as, well, recruits looking to become the first Soldier — a specific top-class army member. Cloud, from FFVII, is introduced in the original as “Soldier, First Class” and this game takes everything back 30 years to the early formation of Shinra Corp’s military finest.</p><p>The setting, then, is a battle royale to see how augmented soldiers fare against each other (and whatever beasts come their way in the process). The battleground is a surprisingly expansive map on the outskirts of Midgar — while also featuring many of the major landmarks of Midgar’s sectors. Aerith’s church and childhood home is there to be shot at, as is the arena, Sector 7’s markets, the abandoned trainyard and more. The battle theme of FF7 kicks in as helicopters swarm into the area, dropping off recruits. It still gets me excited every time.</p><p>The grounds are littered with guns, from handguns to sniper rifles, as well as materia (magic orbs that offer both offensive and support capabilities) and even pretty rare summoning spells. I&#39;ve yet to summon anything so far. There are also potions to pick up and help extend your chances of survival.</p><p>These are the baseline weapons and items. Differentiating itself from <em>Fortnite</em> — if not all BR games; we see you  <em>Apex </em>and<em> Warzone </em> — you can also choose a job role, a la most RPGs. This mostly affects your special ability, your melee weapon and how you attack with it. Warrior is a straight-shooting class with a sword and a rush special that closes distance so you can wallop your rivals before they can get a shot in. Monks have the ability to heal themselves when they mete out damage, while Ninjas get an extra jump and the ability to hide in stealth mode for a few seconds.</p><section data-eng-breakout="812681f423504cbaae8f8b9390ed7d2a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b683eaa0-4d4a-11ec-b5e5-7a080d49066e" alt="Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier" data-uuid="4124ee06-59d8-3804-8801-cf93111b27bd"></section><p>Sorcerers come with a special ability that supercharges MP recovery for more regular offensive (and healing spells), while the ranger reloads guns faster than the others — and has a very convenient Assess skill that will mark threats around you even when they’re out of sight.</p><p>Each feels slightly different to play with, but there’s a pleasant balance to the different roles, though both soldier and monk suffer from having to rely on their melee attack for their advantages.</p><p>Let me say this outright; you should play <em>First Soldier</em> with a gamepad. Fortunately, I’m testing out <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=backbone+iphone+engadget&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enGB945GB945&amp;oq=backbone+iphone+engadget&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j33i160.2829j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">Backbone</a>, a third-party connected controller for iPhone that means I was already in a good place to aim my guns and spells. Magic casting controls are a bit messy — you’ll need to hold down an L-trigger while pressing another collar button to unleash one of three spells you may have picked up.  Those melee attacks, which all job classes have, are really hard to land on your enemies, regardless of whether you’re using a gamepad or touch controls. Hopefully, the devs are able to finesse melee attacks as the game progresses.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>This means that, in a rather un-Final Fantasy way, you’ll come to depend on your guns for most of your kills. But hey, getting that sniper headshot kill is a thrill. Killing other players or monsters, opening chests and surviving through the rounds will level up your character through the match itself. This adds to your attack damage and increases your HP, meaning you should also last longer. It also rewards proactive play and exploration, and not just trying to survive to the final area.</p><p>As you might expect from a free-to-play battle royale game, there are season passes available for purchase. These offer up skins, banners, emotes and more cosmetic goodies for wannabe Soldiers. Even without a pass, you can earn a few rewards by fulfilling “rank” criteria during the battles. Gain stars, level up your rank  — which is unrelated to leveling up your individual job ranks — and you’ll gain access to a smattering of wardrobe options or chocobo-raising items. I’m currently wearing a moogle hat, please say hi.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b683c390-4d4a-11ec-bdfb-c9fadc5712f3" style="height:1049;width:2270;" alt="Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier" data-uuid="690805fa-c9b3-30b3-aa90-aac3d4b69115"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>Yes, there’s also a chocobo rearing mini-game buried inside <em>First Soldier,</em> and you’re able to summon your favorite steed to the battles as a very handy transport option. It isn’t the only way to speed around levels, however. There are also cars and bikes to get you within the battle arena. The shrinking arena damages anyone outside its perimeter, but you’re able to persist with potions and healing spells and hopefully make it to safety.</p><p>The only drawback growing, as I play, is the fact that my leveling up has no tangible effect on my performance in the game — which is true of most battle royale games. The appeal is that each new battle isn’t affected by the round before it, but then chasing these goals (play two rounds as a warrior; make 300 pts of damage with a shotgun; visit Corneo’s mansion) soon tires. What exactly is the point?</p><p>For now, the point is that First Soldier skirmishes are entertaining, and the difficulty curve isn’t too brutal. I’ve won a few rounds, out of 75 players, and come second a handful of times. One colleague told me that early iterations of battle royale games are often filled with bots to juice the numbers (and offer up some encouraging early wins) but I will <em>not</em> let him take this tiny victory away from me.</p><p>Hopefully Square Enix has plans to offer more levels, weapons and events to spice it up. There are some limited-edition bosses throughout the Midgar level. I’ve managed to best two of them, but I’ve also been felled by Tonberry — a notoriously powerful monster from the Final Fantasy series— a few too many times. Maybe I should try fighting him as a ninja...</p><p></p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier</em> is out now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ffvii-the-first-soldier/id1536906780"><ins>Apple App Store</ins></a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.ff7fsww&amp;hl=en"><ins>Google Play.</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-meets-fortnite-the-first-soldier-review-140024318.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68faf6dc-678b-4740-a301-9b717e3a040b</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 25 Nov 2021 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637777227</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T18:07:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b679b170-4d4a-11ec-affb-ce1b5bd321a2" width="2270" height="1049" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b679b170-4d4a-11ec-affb-ce1b5bd321a2" width="2270" height="1049" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII: The First Soldier]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive VR headsets fall to all-time lows for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HTC&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-htc-vive-cosmos-hands-on.html">Vive Cosmos</a> is one of the best VR headsets out there, but if we&#39;re being real, it&#39;s always been a bit too expensive.

It&#39;s strongest feature is the bright and sharp screens with very high 2,880 x 1,700 pixel resolution across both eyes, along with decent 90 Hz refresh rates. The biggest downside is the price, as it&#39;s far more expensive than Oculus headsets — but the sale brings it on par with rivals.

Rather than using the inside-out-tracking, the Elite&#39;s headset comes preinstalled with an External Tracking Faceplate that can be paired with base stations for higher precision.

The HTC Vive Pro offers features like 1,440 x 1,600 pixel resolution per eye on the OLED screens, great ergonomics and built-in headphones. They&#39;re not for everyone because of the price, as we noted in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-03-htc-vive-pro-review.html">review</a>, but you can now pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:HTC Vive Pro system" href="https://amzn.to/30UYPuU">HTC Vive Pro system</a>, including the headset, base stations and controllers 2.0 for $899 instead of $1,199.&nbsp;</p><p>HTC&#39;s Vive Pro Eye improves on that with the addition of eye-tracking that uses Tobii&#39;s technology. It can follow users&#39; eyeballs in real time, letting developers gather data on where they&#39;re looking and when, allowing for new and more immersive experiences.

The feature was spotted in the latest version of Spotify&#39;s beta iOS TestFlight build by Chris Messina, who <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472">tweeted</a> that it appeared as a fourth icon in Spotify&#39;s iOS toolbar.&nbsp;</p><p>Discover looks to be a way for users to find new music in an intuitive, rapid way, by swiping up and down to move through the feed. You can tap on a heart to like the song, or hit the three-dot menu to bring up Spotify&#39;s standard information card about the song.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="efe6324c7dc14208b69ad99464cf0453"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not only that, <a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spotify</a> Discover is basically a pared down version of a TikTok-style feed of vertical music videos (likely using their canvas format) that you can like or skip.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NewSpotify?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NewSpotify</a><a href="https://t.co/hpOEZ8v9bl">pic.twitter.com/hpOEZ8v9bl</a></p>— Messina.eth (@chrismessina) <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismessina/status/1463542273216446472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The format may use Spotify&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-05-spotify-tries-video-loops-as-song-artwork.html">Canvas format</a>, Messina notes. That <a href="https://canvas.spotify.com/en-us">allows</a> artists to create videos to go along with songs, rather than just static images, and appears on certain songs instead of the standard album art when you play a video. They can be in the form of standard video and mixed media, along with 2D and 3D graphics. In pitching the feature, Spotify tells artists that Canvas boosts key engagement metrics like sharing, adding to playlists and visiting profile pages.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify confirmed to <em>TechCrunch</em> that it&#39;s testing the feature, but declined to share further details like how it would curate feeds. &quot;At Spotify, we routinely conduct a number of tests in an effort to improve our user experience,&quot; a spokesperson said. &quot;Some of those tests end up paving the way for our broader user experience and others serve only as an important learning. We don’t have any further news to share at this time.&quot;</p><p>Spotify is far from the first platform to flatter TikTok through imitation. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-launches-reels-to-beat-tiktok-130009783.html">Instagram&#39;s Reels</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-available-globally-161554248.html">YouTube Shorts</a> are virtual clones of TikTok, and even Netflix recently introduced a TikTok-like comedy feed called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html">Fast Laughs</a>.

According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-propose-5g-limits-to-break-air-safety-standoff-11637778722"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the carriers made the offer on Wednesday in a letter they sent to the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p>“While we remain confident that 5G poses no risk to air safety, we are also sensitive to the Federal Aviation Administration’s desire for additional analysis of this issue,” AT&amp;T and Verizon wrote.  Should the FAA accept the proposal, the limit will extend to July 6th. AT&amp;T and Verizon told the FCC they don’t expect the limits to impact their services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the start of November, both companies agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html"><ins>delay their C-band rollouts</ins></a> by one month to January 2022. Officials with the FAA worry widespread use of C-band spectrum may interfere with the altimeter equipment on some aircraft. Pilots often rely on those tools when they need to land, especially when visibility conditions aren’t favorable.</p><p>Both AT&amp;T and Verizon have a strong financial incentive to avoid any further delays to their C-band rollout. The two carriers spent a combined <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html"><ins>$68.8 billion</ins></a> to secure the necessary licenses for their mid-band buildouts and an additional $15 billion on the necessary infrastructure to take advantage of that spectrum.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-fcc-letter-aircraft-safety-211130190.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6730b105-2c99-4c26-96cd-195d982a27a6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 21:11:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637788294</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T21:11:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aa2d19b0-4d69-11ec-bbff-860833ac9f66" width="2769" height="1847" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aa2d19b0-4d69-11ec-bbff-860833ac9f66" width="2769" height="1847" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Kelly / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Verizon logo is seen on the 375 Pearl Street building in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., November 22, 2021.

The Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG) will succeed the US Navy’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force. According to the Defense Department, “AOIMSG will synchronize efforts across the Department and the broader US government to detect, identify and attribute objects of interest in Special Use Airspace (SUA), and to assess and mitigate any associated threats to safety of flight and national security.”</p><p>The formation of the task force follows the release of a report in June in which the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) examined <a href="https://www.engadget.com/odni-uap-report-224708148.html"><ins>144 sightings</ins></a> of “unidentified aerial phenomenon.” Only in one instance were officials able to determine what caused a sighting. For every other incident detailed in that report, ODNI said there was too little data for it to conclude what happened. If the US government were to have any chance at better understanding UFOs, ODNI said it would need to deploy more resources and a standardized approach across various agencies. It would appear the Defense Department has taken that recommendation to heart.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pentago-aoimsg-annoucement-193100761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">001e6762-74ae-4fc9-8dfe-dc4d0592356b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 19:31:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637781427</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T19:17:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1daff930-4d5a-11ec-babb-61114ee6ad70" width="5268" height="3560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1daff930-4d5a-11ec-babb-61114ee6ad70" width="5268" height="3560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Urquhart / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A parking sign at the Little A'Le'Inn as an influx of tourists responding to a call to 'storm' Area 51, a secretive U.S. military base believed by UFO enthusiasts to hold government secrets about extra-terrestrials, is expected in Rachel, Nevada, U.S. September 19, 2019.

He&#39;ll appear at a series of hearings on online protections for kids that a consumer protection subcommittee is holding during the week of December 6th.</p><p>“He’s the top guy at Instagram, and the whole nation is asking about why Instagram and other tech platforms have created so much danger and damage by driving toxic content to children with these immensely powerful algorithms,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who is chair of the subcommittee, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/24/technology/adam-mosseri-instagram-congress.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mosseri will testify in the wake of revelations by whistleblower Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager. Haugen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">told a panel last month</a> that research conducted by Facebook determined “engagement-based ranking on Instagram can lead children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes… to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time.” The previous month, Antigone Davis, the global head of safety for Instagram parent company Meta, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html">downplayed</a> recent reports based on internal Facebook documents, which indicated that Instagram can negatively affect the mental health of teenagers and young girls.</p><p>After Davis testified, Blumenthal wrote to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, asking either him or Mosseri to testify.  Blumenthal suggested in his letter to Zuckerberg that the company “provided false or inaccurate testimony to me regarding attempts to internally conceal its research.”</p><p>This will mark the first time Mosseri has testified before Congress. Blumenthal plans to ask Mosseri to commit to making Instagram&#39;s ranking and recommendation algorithms transparent, partly so experts can look into if and how the platform promotes potentially harmful content. The senator noted that Snap, TikTok and YouTube leaders made similar commitments after they testified at a prior hearing. Blumenthal also said he will ask Mosseri about Instagram&#39;s recommendation systems and how they may lead children &quot;into dangerous rabbit holes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>A group of state attorneys general are also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/state-attorneys-general-instagram-teen-investigation-210538138.html">investigating</a> how Instagram impacts teenagers.

If there’s a theme to the sale, it’s all about CRPGs. Expect to see titles like <a href="https://adtr.co/DtnE4a"><em><ins>Divinity: Original Sin</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://adtr.co/r25kVJ"><em><ins>Divinity 2</ins></em></a> as much as 65 percent off.</p><p>One of the highlights of the sale sees <a href="https://adtr.co/xvym2C"><em><ins>Horizon Zero Dawn</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>discounted by 50 percent to $23.74. The Complete Edition includes the excellent <em>Frozen Wilds </em>DLC that expands the story and adds an entirely new open-world area for players to explore. If you’ve been waiting to pick up <em>Horizon</em> on PC, now is a good time to do so since Guerrilla patched many of the performance issues that hampered the game at launch. We’ll note here <em>Horizon</em> is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/"><ins>50 percent off on Steam</ins></a> if you would rather buy the game through Valve’s storefront.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can also get 50 percent off on both <a href="https://adtr.co/fPLcZe"><em><ins>Disco Elysium</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://adtr.co/7NbQ75"><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em></a>. If we had to pick a favorite among that pair, it would be <em>Disco Elysium</em>. It’s one of the best RPGs to come out in recent memory and has a lot to say about a variety of topics. If the fact it involved a lot of reading made you hesitant to try it before, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disco-elysium-console-final-cut-2021-015155766.html"><ins>The Final Cut</ins></a> release adds full voice acting to the game. At just under $32, we’d say even <em>Cyberpunk</em> is worth it.</p><p>GOG has also discounted the entire Focus Home Interactive catalog by up to 80 percent. In that way, you can get some less-known gems like <a href="https://adtr.co/SltpQc"><em><ins>A Plague Tale: Innocence</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://adtr.co/8pUqM7"><em><ins>Vampyr</ins></em></a> for as low as $9.89.
