GM plans to continue offering Super Cruise for its more mainstream vehicles such as the Escalade, CT4/CT5, Silverado and Sierra while Ultra Cruise will be reserved for the company&#39;s premium offerings.

Further improvements and refinements to the system will be delivered to vehicles via OTA updates. To avoid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fatal-tesla-crash-driverless-200259765.html">Tesla-style wrecks</a>, GM will port Super Cruise’s Driver Attention Camera system over to the new system.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-unveils-a-hands-free-driving-system-that-works-in-nearly-all-of-the-us-and-canada-161752431.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94fdc47c-7a0f-4f60-a55b-38f5feaf3980</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 16:17:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633538821</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T16:47:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8ef60a0-26bb-11ec-9f3e-13e036407550" width="5444" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8ef60a0-26bb-11ec-9f3e-13e036407550" width="5444" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[General Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The all-new 2021 Cadillac Escalade is the first Full-Size SUV to feature Super Cruise, the industryâs first true hands-free driver assistance system for enabled roads.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The all-new 2021 Cadillac Escalade is the first Full-Size SUV to feature Super Cruise, the industryâs first true hands-free driver assistance system for enabled roads.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JLab's $79 wireless office headset has a removable earcup and a 60-hour battery]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>JLab is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">very low-cost wireless earbuds</a>, but it&#39;s determined to make a name for itself in the office as well.

It’s the little things that are simple to overlook. I say that with the confidence of someone that just migrated over from a decade-old iMac to a part-picked PC. The rig I ended up with is solid, I had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html">a nice keyboard</a> already, but oh boy do I really need a new mouse.</p><p>Mice are not sexy computer peripherals. But if, like me, you spend at least eight hours a day with your hand on one, they’re more important than we give them credit for. My old Magic Mouse could have made the move from MacOS to Windows, but I was already negotiating some pretty bad RSI and the internal battery was starting to waiver. Not least of all, I wanted something that I could charge and use at the same time — the temerity, I know.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not to mention, since the advent of devices such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-stream-deck-mk2-trailer-details-faceplates-235437088.html">Stream Deck</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loupedeck-live-versus-the-stream-deck-170020781.html">Loupedeck Live</a> I have developed a taste for physical, assignable controls. Also, as a recent convert to the world of mechanical keyboards, I was hoping there was a similar world of boutique, bespoke options. It turns out that mice are still a largely off-the-shelf affair, but I was determined to get through some of the more promising options and find something I could live with, possibly for another decade.</p><p>My requirements? Fairly simple, but a little more than just something I can comfortably click links with. Top of the list: Ergonomics. The Magic Mouse is… fine, but a little low profile for my palming style. Given my RSI was exclusively in my mousing arm, I figured there’s a good chance ergonomics were to blame.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2cd9abb0-2698-11ec-aabf-9494c8a65d2d" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="dd53e931-71ca-33f0-93e7-8fbb6c05bc2e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Second: I want something that is reasonably configurable. I don’t need to pull off several complex gaming moves; I just want to have things like volume control or the ability to switch between desktops at my fingertips. Thirdly, battery life. I am trying to lose as many cables as I can, so the longer I can go between charging/without a cable around, the better.</p><p>That’s kinda it. It’s not a big ask but I soon learned there was always some mental bargaining going on trying to find the best balance. I also wanted to see what a modern mouse can offer <em>beyond</em> those requirements as, who knows, maybe there’s something I never knew I wanted or I have the sudden urge to get into Dota 2. Enter, the story I thought I’d never write: An 11-way  PC mouse shoot out.</p><h2>The obvious candidates</h2><p>Google around for “the best PC mouse” and you’ll find one answer: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s MX Master 3" href="https://amzn.to/3a67xI4">Logitech’s MX Master 3</a>. You might see a few mentions of others — like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Razer Pro Click" href="https://amzn.to/3Fm2npG">Razer Pro Click</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Microsoft&#x002019;s Surface Precision" href="https://amzn.to/2WMn0do">Microsoft’s Surface Precision</a> mouse — but the reviews are clear that the MX 3 Master is the one.</p><p>I looked at all three of these, and honestly, there’s not a lot in it. All of them cost $100 and all of them meet my basic requirements of decent ergonomics, configurable buttons and solid battery life. The latter is the hardest to quantify thanks to how each manufacturer likes to define “time.” For Logi’s MX 3 Master it’s “70 days.” Razer on the other hand touts the Pro Click as lasting between 200 and 400 hours depending on whether you use their USB dongle or Bluetooth respectively (that’s 8-16 “days” but it’s not clear if this is “in use”).</p><p>Microsoft’s Surface Precision is listed as “up to 3 months” which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It’s hard to know whether those are active use or “the mouse is on and it’s on your desk.” The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3 to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim (I’ve had it here barely a month and already had need to charge it).</p><p>Of this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3 is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second scroll wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer’s “buttons” are side-clicks on the scroll wheel — typically these default to sideways scroll, the same as Logi’s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3 slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops — something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3 has one more spare button in this setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/504ed1b0-2698-11ec-adfb-ef6758e9ac20" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="c67786a8-e83c-33f8-8380-ad0134a4f795"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Additionally, there’s a button on the MX master 3 located just under where your thumb rests. This can be used for almost anything, but by default, it activates something called “gesture control,” which lets you assign certain tasks to, you guessed it, different gestures. I gave the gesture controls a spin and they seemed pretty helpful, but the usefulness soon dissolved when I found I wasn’t always able to ace the gesture on the first attempt.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft’s Surface Precision mouse offers six buttons and includes left/right clicks on the scroll wheel, putting it about on par with Razer and a shade under the MX Master 3 for configuration dorks like me.</p><p>All three companies offer companion software — Microsoft’s is built right-in to Windows. It’s worth noting that Logitech makes a distinction between its office mice and its gaming mice which I’ll get to later (basically, different software with different configuration options). The short version is each gets its own software and what you can do there differs which will be a key factor if considering a variety of their models..</p><p>I found Logitech’s Options software the most straightforward with a deep selection of Windows commands, media controls, shortcuts and navigation tools on offer. You can also assign keystroke combinations if something you need isn’t listed. On top of that there are options for app-specific buttons which means you can, for example, have right-click do one thing in Photoshop but something totally different in Chrome. Logitech doesn’t offer full macros in Options though, so more complex commands are off the table via the native software.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f93a3a30-2698-11ec-9b7d-1a65560ee9b0" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="68848bf7-01cf-3a96-a493-2ce6ac67fb4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Razer’s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the mouse. There’s even “HyperShift” which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button.</p><p>Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard Center is no slouch either with some decent shortcuts on offer and support for both macros and app-specific controls. Though, overall, it’s perhaps less in-depth than both Logitech and Razer’s companion apps.</p><p>On a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of “natural scroll.” It’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don’t mind regular scroll, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse scrolling as a setting, Razer doesn’t appear to — though you can work around this <a href="https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm">in other ways</a> of course.</p><p>All the above mice offer the flexibility of both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connectivity, can be used while cabled and support multi-device (at the same time) modes, if that’s your thing.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Tie between MX Master 3 and Pro Click.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3a67xI4" id="c3d7ca84756a403dbdc7d142b49a9963" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MX Master 3 at Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Fm2npG" id="77b08c50bd5c434f845b41a2f90d7135" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Razer Pro Click at Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2WMn0do" id="8ebc85ef19234e5b8b041ead4e575e88" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Surface Precision mouse at Amazon - $100</a><h2>Gaming mice for everyday use</h2><p>Just because a mouse has a gaming focus, it doesn’t mean it’s no good for productivity. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech G502 Lightspeed" href="https://amzn.to/3Bd2iST">Logitech G502 Lightspeed</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:G Pro X Superlight" href="https://amzn.to/3mqkDpj">G Pro X Superlight</a>. From Razer, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Viper Ultimate" href="https://amzn.to/3iBLBJE">Viper Ultimate</a> looked like another strong option.</p><p>There are a few things that change once you go gamer it seems. First: Things get much much lighter. The heaviest I tried was the G502 which, at 114g is a hair heavier than the Razer Pro Click (106g). But 26g lighter than the MX Master 3. The G Pro X Superlight and the Viper Ultra are much more svelte however, weighing in at 63g and 74g respectively. This puts the G Pro X at under half the weight of its Logitech productivity sibling.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/332e3200-2699-11ec-86ff-53c61ea2020f" alt="The Logitech G502 has a lot of configurable options, especially aimed at gamers." data-uuid="be203487-e08f-3009-8009-f0ac8267620b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The next thing to consider is the form factor. Gaming mice are much more likely to have either a neutral or ambidextrous design. This isn’t a no-no for my RSI concerns (especially when offset against the lighter weight) but it was something I was cautious about. Of the ones I am testing here, the G502 Lightspeed is the most “ergonomic.”</p><p>Lastly, gamers want speed and even 2.4GHz is a bit too laggy for some, so Bluetooth connectivity is rare to find in this category. That’s not a deal-breaker for me, but worth knowing in case it is for you.</p><p>I actually had high hopes for the G502 Lightspeed. Not only is it lighter and a similar form factor to the MX Master 3, it offers a whopping 11 configurable buttons. What’s more you’re able to assign full macros along with a slew of deep keyboard commands to those buttons. From a customization standpoint, it’s pretty comprehensive. The G502’s office-bound rival has most of what you need, but macros aren’t there and the keyboard commands on offer aren’t as extensive as in Logitech’s gamer-focused G Hub software.</p><p>I should mention the G Pro X Superlight here, too, given it uses the same software as the G502. The G Pro X is semi ambidextrous (you can palm it with either hand, but the extra buttons are only on one side). There are only five buttons total, too.</p><p>The issue for me was really all in the handling. I liked that both of these were lighter, that’s a solid plus. But the wealth of buttons on the G502 meant things were a little more cramped. For example, there are two right alongside the left-click button and then another two just above where your thumb rests. They aren’t hard to locate without looking, but overall not as naturally placed as those on the MX Master 3, at least in my opinion. Also, the scroll wheel on both the G502 and the G Pro X protrudes more than any of the other mice on this list which, again, takes some getting used to. Neither was as fluid or comfortable to me as those in the MX Master 3 or Razer Pro click.</p><p>Moreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet scroll (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3 offers both types of scrolling but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found scrolling on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger “clicks” and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it’s better for gamers though.</p><p>The G Pro X, for its part, is a really nice option if you want something light with a couple of extra buttons. But with just two additional ones over the standard two-plus-clickwheel it wasn’t quite up to my requirements.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c117d20-2699-11ec-bffe-e297a55ec7df" alt="Razer&#39;s Viper is a surprisingly good mouse for general productivity." data-uuid="23fbb9e7-c037-3ac5-a59a-be420c671d81"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Razer’s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose mouse. For one, as alluded to, it’s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours).</p><p>The main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a mouse like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test.</p><p>Thanks to gamery specs that I’m not going to make use of, such as 20,000+ DPI sensors and 1000Hz polling rates, all of the gaming mice do cost more than the “productivity” options. In fact all three cost the same: $150.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Razer Viper Ultimate</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Bd2iST" id="8f37f1a6e30d45beafe4318f0e19755e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy G502 Lightspeed at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mqkDpj" id="064e4b882bc34181a0b5291ba6a6434c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy G Pro X Superlight at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3iBLBJE" id="4bc2bd2b53dc49e9a8d9e5a4cbde8afe" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Viper Ultimate at Amazon - $150</a><h2>Mobile mice</h2><p>Let’s be clear, there’s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it’s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do <em>everything</em>. A mobile mouse can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well.</p><p>There’s also the fact that many of us are working at home on the company laptop, so pairing that with a mouse can make the transition back to the office a little smoother (and not everyone is a fan of trackpads anyway). As such, a straight head-to-head feels less appropriate, but here’s a rundown of five contenders.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0532d800-269a-11ec-affb-68b8ee0e5893" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="2aa4fef7-ff79-3a60-95c0-1e8293a3f62e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Logitech Pebble</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Pebble" href="https://amzn.to/3DsVIbN">Logitech’s Pebble</a> is a mobile mouse in the purest form. At 100g it’s not the lightest on this list, but that does give it a reassuring feel in use. There are only three buttons: The standard left click, right click and click wheel. You also have the choice between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz dongle connectivity. A nice touch is that you can stow the USB dongle under the top plate as that’s also where you’ll change the (AA) battery.</p><p>The Pebble has a slight angle to it which felt like my hand was arching forward when in use. The ambidextrous design is welcome but I do have my concerns about how comfortable it is for extended use. The two aces up the Pebble’s sleeve, however, are its epic battery life: A claimed 18 months (though this will obviously depend on what batteries you use) and the $25 price tag, making it the cheapest on this list.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DsVIbN" id="8fe59378955a4a6cb239b55a2fcc033c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Logitech Pebble at Amazon - $30</a><h3>Logitech MX Anywhere 3</h3><p>As the name suggests, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MX Anywhere 3" href="https://amzn.to/3B8HAU9">MX Anywhere 3</a> is the mobile version of the MX Master 3. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It’s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing scroll wheel — which at $80, it should.</p><p>With six buttons, it’s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won’t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the mouse somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3B8HAU9" id="56e4d89225e94013a2d4ea7b0058ea98" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MX Anywhere 3 at Amazon - $80</a><h3>Razer Orochi V2</h3><p>The winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Orochi V2" href="https://amzn.to/2YiJ5kf">Orochi V2</a>. Or maybe it’s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile mouse with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer’s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1ce065d0-269a-11ec-bfbf-883f3747708a" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="977e0eb1-a614-3875-aa48-fdab6441b2d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>At 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it’s also pretty nimble. At $70, it’s edging into full-desktop mouse territory, but given that it’s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YiJ5kf" id="0f3e5990afa54bf397eb3ef492c6df4f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Razer Orochi V2 at Amazon - $70</a><h3>Microsoft Surface Arc</h3><p>Who was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish mouse on this list? The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Surface Arc" href="https://amzn.to/3uGNLMT">Surface Arc</a> is a delight with a “transforming” design that pops into shape (an “arc” no less). Once you’re done simply snap it flat again for easy storage in a pocket of your laptop bag. You don’t even need to turn it on as “snapping” it also acts as a power switch. Oh, and did I mention that the touchpad area does double duty as left/right click and vertical or sideways scroll (Magic Mouse style)? There’s even the option for a “triple” click to give the Surface Arc an extra, assignable button. All that, and it’s only around $55.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/40e98e70-269a-11ec-b5dd-389b0f705426" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="b2beab99-9d40-3fb3-ae90-7dd37fc4b703"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don’t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile mouse, though, it’s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uGNLMT" id="ad1f317c28644ef78b5e1bdddef4159a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Microsoft Surface Arc at Amazon - $50</a><h3>Microsoft Modern Mobile mouse</h3><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Modern Mobile mouse" href="https://amzn.to/3ovHLp7">Modern Mobile mouse</a> is Microsoft’s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There’s no 2.4GHz option here though; it’s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble’s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there’s a lot to like about Microsoft’s take on a portable mouse.</p><p>For one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller mouse and doesn’t feel like it’s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that’s smarter than it first seems.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ovHLp7" id="f4d8648b572542bb8d34494b966a843f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Modern Mobile mouse at Amazon - $35</a><h2>Conclusion</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c0a0da0-269a-11ec-be46-7eeed37a001b" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="14dd7979-60d7-309e-8894-33d703d65cc4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If nothing else, I was surprised by the diversity of options despite my initial concern to the contrary. Who knew that Microsoft had such style, at least in the mobile category? Likewise, Razer, it turns out, makes surprisingly adept productivity mice despite its true-green gamer aesthetic. Logitech, on the other hand, is a steady hand across all categories.</p><p>Predictably, the MX Master 3 does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second scroll wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3 in every other manner. It’s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor.</p><p>For those that prefer lightweight options (something that became more appealing to me the more I tested), then the Viper Ultimate from Razer impressed me with its balance of function and form. If you don’t need as many buttons then Logitech’s Pro X Superlight lives up to its name. I could happily live with either of these mice full time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-mice-pc-gaming-mobile-150027822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8f67888-7dba-4fba-8d3c-71a6571a9970</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 15:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633530766</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:32:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/858405c0-2694-11ec-9eae-3a66b73c0d08" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/858405c0-2694-11ec-9eae-3a66b73c0d08" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PC Mouse buyer's guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PC Mouse buyer's guide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's owner buys SteelSeries to expand into gaming gear]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Add SteelSeries to the ranks of gaming hardware brands <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-12-logitech-astro-console-headset-gaming-acquisition.html">selling themselves to larger tech firms</a>.

She also praised the company’s researchers, calling them “heroes,” and said Facebook should be required to make their work public.</p><h2>Remove algorithmic ranking and go back to chronological feeds</h2><p>One of the most notable aspects of Haugen’s testimony was her expertise, which gives her a nuanced understanding of how algorithms work and the often unintended consequences of using them.</p><p>“I hope we will discuss as to whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal said at the start of the hearing. While Haugen never addressed that question directly, she did weigh on the ranking algorithms that power the feeds in Facebook and Instagram. She noted that Facebook’s own research has found that “engagement-based ranking on Instagram can lead children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes… to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time.”</p><p>She also said that Facebook’s AI-based moderation tools were much less effective than what the company has publicly portrayed. “We&#39;ve seen from repeated documents within my disclosures that Facebook&#39;s AI systems only catch a very tiny minority of offending content,” Haugen said. “Best case scenario, in the case of something like hate speech, at most they will ever get to 10 to 20%.”</p><p>To address this, Haugen said that Facebook could move to a chronological feed where posts are ordered by recency, rather than what is most likely to get engagement. “I&#39;m a strong proponent of chronological ranking, or ordering by time with a little bit of spam demotion, because I think we don&#39;t want computers deciding what we focus on,” Haugen said.</p><p>She noted that Facebook would likely resist such a plan because content that gets more engagement is better for their platform because it causes people to post and comment more. “I&#39;ve spent most of my career working on systems like engagement-based ranking,” Haugen said. “When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years of my own work.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b1dcb470-2660-11ec-b6f3-98232b6723a6" alt="Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) centre speaks as Facebook Global Head of Safety Director, Antigone Davis, testifies remotely before a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security to examine protecting children online, focusing on Facebook, Instagram, and mental health harms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, September 30, 2021.

She also noted that using the law to police Facebook’s algorithms could be easier than trying to address specific types of content. “User generated content is something that companies have less control over, they have 100% control over their algorithms,” Haugen said.</p><p>The focus on Section 230 is significant because lawmakers from both parties have proposed various changes to the law. During the hearing, Blumenthal indicated that he too supported “narrowing this sweeping immunity when platforms’ algorithms amplify illegal conduct.” Senator Amy Klobuchar has also proposed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/health-misinformation-act-2021-204010072.html">ending 230 protections</a> for vaccine and health misinformation. Meanwhile, Republicans have tried to eliminate Section 230 for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-section-230-144905272.html">very different</a> reasons.</p><h2>Slow down virality</h2><p>Likewise, Haugen suggested that Facebook should slow down its platform with “soft interventions” that would add small bits of friction to the platform. She pointed to Twitter’s “read before sharing” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-read-before-sharing-ios-143931229.html">prompts </a>as the kind of measure that can reduce the spread of misinformation.</p><p>“Small actions like that friction don&#39;t require picking good ideas and bad ideas,” she said. “They just make the platform less twitchy, less reactive. And Facebook&#39;s internal research says that each one of those small actions dramatically reduces misinformation, hate speech and violence-inciting content on the platform.”</p><p>Facebook has taken these steps in the past. Notably, it applied these <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-prepares-potentially-chaotic-election-aftermath-172523590.html">“break glass” measures</a> in the days after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-slow-down-sharing-election-misinformation-003823933.html">presidential election</a>, though the company rolled some of them back the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-election-news-feed-algorithm-reversal-publishers-160308027.html">following month</a>. The company implemented similar changes again, less than a month later, in the aftermath of the insurrection January 6th.</p><p>Huagen said that Facebook has mischaracterized these changes as being harmful to free speech, when in fact the company is concerned because it “wanted that growth back.” During the hearing, she said that Mark Zuckerberg had been personally briefed on just how impactful changes like this could be. But, she said, he prioritized the platform’s growth “over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation and other inciting content.”</p><h2>Open Facebook’s research to people outside the company</h2><p>Access to Facebook’s data has become a hot button issue in recent weeks as researchers outside the company have complained that the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">is stifling</a> independent research. Haugen said the social network should work toward making its own internal research available to the public.</p><p>She proposed that there should be a set period of time — she suggested as long as 18 months — when Facebook is able to keep its research under wraps. But then the company should make it accessible to those outside the company.</p><p>“I believe in collaboration with academics and other researchers that we can develop privacy-conscious ways of exposing radically more data that is available today,” Haugen said. “It is important for our ability to understand how algorithms work, how Facebook shapes the information, we get to see that we have these data sets to be publicly available for scrutiny.”</p><p>She went on to say that Facebook&#39;s researchers are among its “biggest heroes” because “they are boldly asking real questions and willing to say awkward truths.” She said it was “unacceptable” that the company has been “throwing them under the bus” in its effort <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html">to downplay</a> her disclosures.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2f0598c0-265e-11ec-bfdf-5666e73b4bde" alt="Zuckerberg took weeks to weigh in on the whistleblower&#39;s disclosures, except for a comment about his electric surfboard." data-uuid="977234f9-57f3-31c8-b62a-95927722f358"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><h2>A dedicated ‘oversight body’</h2><p>Besides internal changes, Haugen also said that there should be a dedicated “oversight body” with the power to oversee social media platforms. She said that such a group within an agency like the Federal Trade Commission could provide “a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this.”</p><p>“Right now, the only people in the world who are trained to analyze these experiments, to understand what&#39;s happening inside of Facebook, are people who grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest or another social media company,” she said.</p><p>Importantly, this “oversight body” would be separate from the Facebook-created <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oversight%20board">Oversight Board</a>, which advises Facebook on specific content decisions. While Facebook has said the creation of the Oversight Board is proof it’s trying to self-regulate, Haugen wrote in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-s-senate-testimony/8d324185-d725-4d99-9160-9ce9e13f58a3/">prepared remarks</a> that the Oversight Board “is as blind as the public” when it comes to truly knowing what happens inside of the company.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Haugen said she was opposed to efforts to break up Facebook. She said that separating Facebook and Instagram would likely result in more advertisers flocking to Instagram, which could deplete Facebook’s resources for making changes to improve its platform.</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>While it’s unclear which, if any, of Haugen’s recommendations Congress will act on, her disclosures have already caught the attention of regulators. In addition to providing documents to Congress, she has also given documents to the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-sec-complaint-60-minutes-2021-10-04/">Securities and Exchange Committee</a>. She has alleged that Zuckerberg and other executives have “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection,&quot; according to SEC filings published by <em>60 Minutes.</em></p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook has continued to push back on Haugen’s claims. A week after an executive told lawmakers that “this is not bombshell research,” the company tried to discredit Haugen more directly. In a statement, Facebook’s Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch, said Haugen “worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives. We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about.” Pietsch added that “it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet.”</p><p>In an appearance <a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1445474828329181188">on CNN</a> following the hearing, Facebook VP Monika Bickert referred to Haugen’s disclosures as “stolen documents” and said the company’s research had been “mischaracterized.” Later that night, Zuckerberg publicly weighed in for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-denies-facebook-profit-over-safety-033717690.html">first time</a> since <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> began publishing stories based on Haugen&#39;s disclosures (Zuckerberg did once <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113917270874401">refer </a>to earlier coverage of the scandals, complaining that a news article has mistakenly described his hydrofoil as an &quot;electric surfboard.&quot;) In his first substantive statement, he said &quot;many of the claims don&#39;t make any sense,&quot; and that &quot;the argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It could still get more difficult for Facebook to counter Haugen, though, particularly if new documents become public. Her letter to the SEC suggests that Facebook knew much more about QAnon and violent extremism on its platform than it let on, as <em>Vice</em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5v4y/facebooks-algorithm-spread-qanon-content-to-new-users">reported earlier</a>. Haugen may also make appearances in front of lawmakers in other countries, too.  European lawmakers, many of whom have expressed similar concerns as their US counterparts, have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-faces-wrath-of-eu-lawmakers-working-on-online-content-rules/">also indicated</a> they want to talk to Haugen and conduct <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-politicians-call-facebook-investigation-after-whistleblower-revelation-2021-10-04/">new investigations</a> of their own.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fa48470-6cee-4103-bf14-7ac06e11168f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633528621</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T13:57:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c7435030-25f7-11ec-8ffe-eed4478fd616" width="6432" height="4288" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c7435030-25f7-11ec-8ffe-eed4478fd616" width="6432" height="4288" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing entitled 'Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower' on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., October 5, 2021.

It has wide, non-pneumatic tires plus a dual suspension system that works to stabilize both the front and back wheel. You&#39;re also getting a double-braking system outfitted with both a mechanical and electrical brake that lets you stop within 13 inches at 12.4 mph. When riding at nighttime, you can turn on the front-facing LED for better visibility, too. We also appreciate that the ES4 is fairly portable — it&#39;s hefty at 31 pounds, but it folds down neatly so you can stow it in a trunk or take it on public transportation.</p><p>And like most gadgets today, the ES4 connects to Segway&#39;s mobile app and that lets you do things like lock and unlock the scooter, activate cruise control, install firmware updates and check out riding stats. While a scooter like this probably won&#39;t replace all other forms of transportation, it&#39;s a convenient way to get from one place to another — especially for those living in big cities or dense suburbs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/segways-ninebot-es4-scooter-is-260-off-today-only-at-amazon-141002029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3974b5e7-c8ef-4a50-82b3-e99f5d4a1b7d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:10:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633528825</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:00:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/d2d07040-25c6-11eb-99b7-d313539423e7" width="1602" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/d2d07040-25c6-11eb-99b7-d313539423e7" width="1602" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SEGWAY]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NINEBOT KICKSCOOTER ES4 electric scooter]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SEGWAY NINEBOT KICKSCOOTER ES4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTags are cheaper than usual when you buy four]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now might be a good time to buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">Apple&#39;s AirTags</a> if you need more than one or two.

This week it’s Nintendo giving the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-01-nintendo-switch-review.html">OG Switch</a> a makeover, adding an OLED screen and a few other exterior tweaks. But it’s basically the same system on the inside, so don’t call it the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-oled-switch-not-switch-pro-161744624.html">Switch Pro</a>. It’s officially dubbed the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/2YnoQ4D">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, because calling it the “slightly nicer Switch” doesn’t really move units from the shelves. If you’ve already invested in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-nintendo-switch-review-two-years.html">Switch</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-nintendo-switch-lite-review.html">Switch Lite</a> you won’t need the upgrade, but if you’re still Switch-less this is the model to buy.</p><p>It’s $50 more than the original, which is not being pulled from shelves just yet. For $350, the new Switch has a full 7-inch OLED screen, a step up from the older model’s 6.2-inch display. The larger screen size is appreciated, though after six hours of playing it in handheld mode I didn’t notice the difference as much.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/aef798b0-261a-11ec-adc7-fb56dc1e1566" alt="OG Switch and OLED model" data-uuid="383fb5d0-8dc4-3541-89f2-a39dc0074ae3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>What did catch my attention when I switched back to the original were the chunky bezels around the 6.2-inch display. I’ve never liked them and found them to be one of the least attractive things about the system. Now they make me recoil in disgust when I compare them to the OLED model’s slim lines, which have been whittled to a third of the size. The matte plastic frame around the screen has also shrunk and changed to a glossy plastic, making it even less obtrusive.</p><p>As for the display itself: yes, it is noticeably brighter. There’s enough of a difference that in my <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-hands-on-130019060.html">initial hands-on</a> I was dismayed when I returned to my personal Switch at home hours later. When placed side by side, the difference is undeniable. The colors pop just a bit more, the blacks are deeper and the whites are… more white, with the original having a slight lavender tint in contrast to the purer white of the OLED screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8e3d7400-261a-11ec-bfff-1153d1e59a6f" alt="Metroid Dread on the screen" data-uuid="73e97f68-8934-3d3d-9450-a82fba8402ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>While not every game will benefit from better colors, Nintendo is also releasing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/2WOD6Dm"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> the same day. Like all titles in the series, the game traffics in a lot of dark spaces, with the bright pop of Samus’ red and yellow (or blue) armor contrasting nicely alongside backgrounds of brown and gray. It’s a good showcase for the OLED’s improved color fidelity and just a nice-looking game in general, which distracts from the fact that the new Switch doesn’t bring any actual improvements under the hood.</p><p>The CPU and GPU go unaltered, which ensures that all future Switch titles remain compatible with existing Switch and Switch Lite systems. This is pretty much in keeping with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-boy-advance-20th-anniversary-150023359.html">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-3ds-10th-anniversary-games-160019952.html">3DS</a> lines of products, which saw some radical redesigns like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/game-boy/micro/">Game Boy micro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/2ds">2DS</a> over their lifespans. Sure, there were handhelds like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/DSi/">DSi</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds.html">New 3DS</a> that came with improved internal specs, but those never saw widespread adoption. The Switch OLED is a lot more like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/nintendo/game-boy/advance/sp/">Game Boy Advance SP</a>: significant improvements to the display and form factor, but the same old library of games.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5f3c07a6ff91476d9e8e42a277c6cae6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/01c34670-261b-11ec-9ff9-7ae578fac53e" alt="GBA SP, DS Lite, 3DS XL, Switch, Switch OLED"></section><p>Alongside that new display are a bunch of minor tweaks that don’t seem like much when considered individually, but as a whole really improve the experience. The most notable is the new stand on the back. The one on the original Switch is small and roughly a finger’s width, with only two positions: open and closed. The one on my original launch unit no longer locks in the “closed” position and has a tendency to flop out when I’m playing in handheld mode. It also detaches completely if you look at it funny.</p><p>The Switch OLED’s stand is an entirely different beast. Instead of a skinny little strip, it’s now a Microsoft Surface-style panel that stretches across the back of the entire unit, with real hinges that can be left in a number of positions so you can now put your unit at whatever angle you prefer. I wouldn’t try to pull this thing off; the hinges are actually molded into the plastic, so if you do break it, it’ll have to go off to the Nintendo repair shop to get fixed up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b0bdf80-261b-11ec-93d7-3651390a7516" alt="Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch OLED, face down" data-uuid="a90e348a-e0aa-3056-ad4f-0f17f422a93e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>To accommodate the new stand a bunch of stuff has been moved around on the back of the Switch unit. The logo is now printed on the stand itself, so it’s been moved to the lower half of the rear. The manufacturing info, like the parts number and voltage, is now printed in black on the black plastic, underneath the stand. So it’s doubly hidden — a subtle but welcome improvement. The rear speakers have been moved to the bottom edge of the unit, where they also serve as a way to pull the stand out. It’s actually very thoughtful, while providing clear game audio and minimizing system noise. And, while the microSD hasn’t been completely relocated, it’s now placed parallel to the bottom edge. I assume this small change is to keep users from accidentally pulling out the card when they’re trying to adjust the stand. The one thing that hasn’t been relocated is the USB-C port on the bottom, so you still can’t recharge it in tabletop mode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6651cf20-261c-11ec-9bd7-e672b3c5ea6f" alt="Face down, bottom pointed at camera" data-uuid="506c15f4-a8f0-366b-9d8a-7fb9995382c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are fewer changes to the device’s top edge, with the most notable being a button redesign resulting in longer, thinner power and volume switches. The new buttons aren’t easier to hit, but they do look sleeker and feel better under my fingers thanks to the textured plastic of the Switch OLED. The system is actually just nicer to hold now, like when it kept the sweat from pooling under my clammy hands during a particularly stressful boss fight in <em>Metroid Dread</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2ac8330-261b-11ec-89ff-780e38f8c134" alt="Metroid Dread on screen, Joy-Cons in front" data-uuid="3b644227-dcb5-371e-befd-342524da783b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Because the Switch OLED has to be compatible with all existing accessories, that means the unit is the same height and width as the original model. The Joy-Cons haven’t gotten a redesign, but hopefully the infamous “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-president-apologizes-joy-con-drift-161644217.html">Joy-Con drift</a>” has been eradicated by now. The new black and white color scheme is very nice, a step up from my all-gray launch unit in terms of style. If you like a more playful color palette, the Switch OLED can also be bought with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED red and blue" href="https://amzn.to/3DtAYRd">red and blue Joy-Cons</a>, or you can swap any other Joy-Cons you want. But the white ones don’t show scratches as easily as the other shades, so they’ll look spiffy for longer.</p><p>The one change in the system’s dimensions is the weight, thanks to the OLED screen. When handling the original and new Switch side by side, the difference is undeniable. But it’s not a big enough divide to make the Switch OLED less portable in any way. Subjectively, it might actually seem a bit lighter, possibly because the weight is well-distributed. The one thing about the build that feels like a step down is that the OLED model has a tiny bit of flex in the middle of the rear panel that’s not present in the original. However, it doesn’t make much of a difference to the build quality unless you’re planning to take a hammer to the back of the unit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c615c250-261b-11ec-bf6d-ef569e96d4b3" alt="Face down, on a stack of games" data-uuid="5dcbe3cd-7fcf-3285-92ec-77563bb0fb94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Because the system keeps the same internals, that means the battery has gone unchanged as well. It’s the same as the refreshed 2019 battery, which offers between four and nine hours of battery life compared to the launch unit’s cap of six hours.  However, the new OLED should be more power-efficient than the LCD, and in use it appears to be. I got almost seven hours of <em>Metroid Dread</em> before I got the “low battery” warning at 15 percent, and that’s a game that makes frequent use of vibration. Compare that to the four or five hours I tend to get out of my OG Switch, even when playing something fairly tame like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-switch.html"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-gaming-irl-untitled-goose-game.html"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a>.</p><p>If you already have an existing Switch, you can drop the OLED model into your current dock and it will work just fine. But the system does come with its own, redesigned dock that you might want to set up. It looks a lot nicer thanks to its rounded corners and glossy black plastic on the inside (which admittedly will probably scratch up over time). The back panel isn’t great, as it feels flimsy and can come off completely (so you may lose it). But all of these are outweighed by the important addition of an ethernet port.</p><section data-eng-breakout="a3dc9844ee064bba99a8475831c25d8c" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb356400-261b-11ec-b5f7-5fe1742760c7" alt="rear of dock, closed" data-uuid="8c8bda87-4ffd-3326-8eec-027d283d7f03"></section><p>Prior to this, the Switch has always been intended as a wireless system, and it hasn’t been stellar. Early models had a tendency to “forget” how to connect to your WiFi, forcing you to restart the system. And even now, downloading from the Nintendo eShop can be pokey; even with the OLED model I had to leave my system sitting for an hour or two while it downloaded games wirelessly. But now you can just plug in a cable for a faster, more reliable connection. If you have one in your living room, that is. Many people don’t, which makes this a feature for the more technical-minded fans. It’s the one new feature of the Switch OLED that I would consider “pro” level, and if you have a place to plug in it’s certainly worth the $50 premium.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c50fce90-261c-11ec-8ffb-bedf7b09424a" alt="with back panel open" data-uuid="68f0548e-b856-37d3-bfeb-35b2eaea40e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Overall, the Switch OLED is a nice system coming out at an odd time, as it’s been over four years since the release of the original Switch. Based on Nintendo’s past release history, that would indicate a new console some time around 2023. So it’s a big ask of people to buy a $350 system if something better is just around the corner. (<a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1443366440183074819">Nintendo has categorically denied that it has plans for a new Switch</a> as recently as last week, but that doesn’t preclude that one will come out eventually.)</p><p>There’s also the specter of the Steam Deck in December, just two short months from now (assuming no delays). It&#39;s far more powerful than the Switch, and is also much larger, but promises access to almost the entire Steam library, which happens to overlap with the current Nintendo eShop quite a bit. The biggest selling point for the Switch OLED is access to storied franchises like Mario and Zelda, as well as the incredible bargain that is Switch Online. But you don’t need an OLED screen or wired ethernet to enjoy old NES, SNES, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-n64-genesis-online-new-plan-223038490.html">N64 and Genesis</a> titles.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a9e6fcb0-261c-11ec-b677-e740eb1dca4f" alt="Switch OLED turned off" data-uuid="340d79c4-8d60-3ec6-83ac-da88d5ef440e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re not going to be able to plug it into ethernet, or don’t need better speeds because you play offline all the time, the choice to upgrade to a Switch OLED is tricky. If you always play on the TV, there’s absolutely no point in buying this one, as there’s no difference in the dock’s output quality. It’s going to look the same as it always has, as this is most definitely not the rumored upgrade to 4K. But even if you’re a handheld player it’s not a must-have, unless you’ve given up on your original Switch because you just really, really hate LCD displays, or absolutely need more than five hours of battery life.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37c8630a-06df-4f1e-bd1a-bfbb911bab0e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633525322</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T13:02:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samus Aran in a save point]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alphabet's Wing tests drone deliveries from shopping center rooftops in Australia]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet subsidiary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-alphabet-wing-drone-delivery-service-australia.html">Wing</a> has launched a pilot program that will have its drones fly products from the rooftops of shopping centers. In fact, it has already started the program in its biggest market, Logan, Australia. The subsidiary has teamed up with Australian retail property group, Vicinity Centres, to test the new model at Logan&#39;s Grand Plaza, where Wing&#39;s drones have been flying orders to customers from businesses directly below their launching pad.&nbsp;</p><p>Wing has been operating in Logan over the past two years, but up until now, businesses have had to co-locate their products at the company&#39;s delivery facility. This is the first time the subsidiary is conducting deliveries from participating merchants&#39; existing location instead. Wing has been flying its drones from the rooftop of Grand Plaza since mid-August, delivering sushi, bubble tea, smoothies and other products from merchants in the shopping center. Starting today, the drones will also deliver over-the-counter medicine and personal care and beauty products.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within the first six weeks of operating from the Grand Plaza, Wing&#39;s drones have already made 2,500 deliveries to several Logan suburbs. The Alphabet company plans to expand not just its partner merchants in the center, but also its delivery coverage area. Jesse Suskin, Wing’s Head of Policy &amp; Community Affairs in Australia, also said that if the Grand Plaza pilot is successful, the company can &quot;potentially roll out similar models in other locations across Vicinity Centres’ retail property portfolio.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>While it remains to be seen whether the Grand Plaza pilot will lead to rooftop deliveries from more Vicinity locations, Wing has been quite successful in Logan. It has already made more than 50,000 deliveries in the city this year alone and has celebrated its 100,000th delivery overall last August.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/071812c0-269a-11ec-bfdf-094f1cc58eeb" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Wing" data-uuid="3e37ff39-e24c-3d8d-8c92-e92dbe28b14e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wing</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-shopping-center-rooftops-pilot-130022044.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a97df23-08ee-433c-b637-4bb0c2a84bc8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633521211</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T11:53:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae07fd90-2693-11ec-afef-627c01a334e8" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae07fd90-2693-11ec-afef-627c01a334e8" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wing]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alphabet Wing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alphabet Wing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Facebook's October 4th outage, explained]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ll get into why Facebook saw its entire business fall off a cliff on Monday, but first: e-readers.</p><p>It’s a device category we don’t see much development in — probably because it’s very much a device for reading text and not much else.

It will sell products from small businesses across the UK, as well as the company&#39;s own devices, including Kindle e-Readers, Fire tablets and Echo speakers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shop will have sections that correspond to specific sections of the website, as well, such as Most Wished For, which will feature products from Wish Lists. &quot;Trending in Bluewater&quot; will showcase items local customers have been buying, while &quot;Most Gifted&quot; will feature the top items ordered as gifts. Amazon says it will switch out products regularly based on customer feedback and to keep up with the latest trends.&nbsp;</p><p>Products in the store will be marked with digital tags containing the item&#39;s price, average star rating and the number of customer reviews. In addition, customers don&#39;t have to be Prime members to be able to shop there.

That came about because of a lawsuit filed on behalf of two Uber drivers, James Farrer and Yaseen Aslam, who eventually helped form the ADCU in February 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Transport for London (TfL) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-uber-london-license-revoked-transport.html">pulled Uber&#39;s license</a> in 2019 over &quot;a pattern of failures.&quot; One particular sore point was that it allowed uninsured and suspended drivers to operate in the city, due to a loophole allowing them to upload their photos to another driver&#39;s account. To meet the regulator&#39;s requirements, Uber introduced random driver checks via a facial recognition system that uses Microsoft&#39;s FACE API technology, according to the ADCU.

Now, HMD/Nokia have launched their first tablet together, the 10.4-inch T20, with the key features being a large battery, cheap price and US availability.</p><p>The T20 isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call a beautiful tablet, given the plain-Jane design and chunky bezels, though it does have a solid metal body structure and relatively thin (7.8mm) and light (470g) profile. The screen also looks pretty nice on paper, with 2K (2,000 x 1,200) resolution and 400 nits of brightness.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/928f4480-2673-11ec-bfff-de0e1d582fdd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="1a12ef8d-0a13-33b2-a9dc-f570b57f62b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nokia</div></figure><p>The key feature is the battery, though. With an 8,200mAh (non-removable) cell, it will let you surf the web for 15 hours between charges, play video for 10 hours or do Zoom-type calls for seven hours. It also comes with relatively fast charging (15 watts), though the charger in the box outputs just 10 watts.</p><p>Other specs are about what you&#39;d expect for a tablet in this price category, including a Tiger T610 8-core CPU, up to 4GB of RAM/64GB of storage (expandable), and an 8-megapixel rear camera/5-megapixel front camera. There&#39;s optional LTE as well, though Nokia didn&#39;t say how much extra that would cost.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a8f11870-2673-11ec-a5ef-5b909e84030f" style="height:1337;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="95bdb032-2841-3d76-abf0-8548df3ff479"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Giacomo Mantovani</div></figure><p>For what it is, $250 price looks pretty decent. However, the world of Android tablets is an unremarkable one — will Nokia&#39;s brand recognition matter?

They&#39;d have to install it themselves, but the carrier says it will take them as little as 15 minutes. T-Mobile started testing the wireless home internet service in rural and underserved areas a couple of years ago in an invite-only trial for 50,000 homes. It rolled out access to the pilot program to over 130 cities across the US before the service&#39;s official launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those interested will have to take note, however, that the price only applies if they pay via AutoPay.

Taking the turn-by-turn functionality that Maps is known for, the tool allows you to see important details about your current trip without the need to keep your phone’s screen turned on. You also don’t need to enter the full turn-by-turn interface to use the feature. At a glance, it will also allow you to see your current ETA and any changes in elevation.</p><p>Google announced the introduction of lite navigation as part of a broader effort related to sustainability. So as you might imagine, it’s not the only cycling-related announcement the company had.

With today’s rollout, Maps will display the most fuel-efficient route you can take to a destination, in addition to the fastest one as it has always done. The tool will also display your relative fuel savings should you decide to follow the more efficient route. Google estimates the feature may help prevent as much as 1 million tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. That’s about the equivalent of removing 200,000 cars from the road.

Like Google&#39;s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt pointed out at a media event yesterday, they&#39;re also bad for the environment and public health. The company unveiled a slew of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html">sustainability-centric products</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-sustainability-travel-shopping-070110212.html">updates today</a> that aim to help users make more informed, environmentally friendly decisions. But it&#39;s also been working on a project that could use AI to make traffic lights more efficient and, as a result, decrease pollution in general.&nbsp;</p><p>When your vehicle stops at an intersection, that idling time leads to wasted fuel and &quot;more street-level air pollution,&quot; Brandt said. Google&#39;s new project would use AI to measure and calculate traffic conditions and timing at a city&#39;s intersections, then time them more efficiently. Brandt said one of the company&#39;s AI research groups has been able to accurately calculate and gather this data and train a model to optimize inefficient intersections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has run pilots at four locations in Israel to date, in partnership with the municipalities of Haifa, Beer-Sheva and the Israel National Roads Company. The company says it&#39;s observed a &quot;10 to 20 percent reduction in fuel and intersection delay time&quot; so far. Google didn&#39;t share any details on the average daily traffic in those intersections, though a video clip from the event showed a fairly busy junction. The company also didn&#39;t explain how the AI would work with current systems and the lights around specific intersections.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s early days,&quot; Brandt said, &quot;but on the back of these promising results, we are now beginning new pilots in Rio de Janeiro and speaking with other cities around the globe.&quot; Though we&#39;re likely still at least years away from having AI manage <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/12/engineers-who-hacked-in-la-traffic-signal-computers-jamming-traffic-sentenced.html">our traffic intersections</a>, this is one of the steps towards the vision of completely smart cities that the industry has collectively been working on for years.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of letting AI decide when to let vehicles stop or go can seem unsettling at best and potentially risky, but the goal of improving traffic light efficiency is a worthwhile one. Hopefully, with rigorous testing and safety measures in place, we may actually be able to reduce a significant amount of wasted fuel and exhaust-based pollution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-traffic-lights-research-environment-pollution-070132356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38eee67a-2d14-4c53-a3b5-8f5369e5b285</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633469840</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T21:37:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration demonstrating how Google's AI could optimize traffic lights at an intersection.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google AI Traffic Light research project]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest Renew program can help you use more clean energy at home]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s latest effort to help you make more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-minecraft-sustainability-report-map-154637717.html">environmentally friendly</a> decisions is all about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-texas-storm-power-grid-133029237.html">your power grid</a>. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/nest-renew-clean-energy/">new Nest Renew program</a> is a suite of features that look at the times of day when the electricity feeding into your home is cleaner and turning your compatible Nest thermostats on or off accordingly. Renew arrives in a by-invitation preview in the coming weeks, and will be available for free in the continental US when it launches publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>At the heart of Nest Renew is the understanding that at any given time, the power grid in your neighborhood contains a mix of clean and traditional energy. In the early afternoon, perhaps, there could be a higher concentration of electricity from solar sources, while a windier day could mean more power from turbines is coming through. Depending on the region, power grids could be getting their electricity from a diverse mix of sources. According to Nest product manager Jeff Gleeson, &quot;a smart dynamic electric grid really needs smart homes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nest Renew will not only automate some of this decision-making for you, but it can also give you insights on the type of power coming into your home. First, a new feature called Energy Shift will let those with a Google account and compatible Nest Thermostat automatically activate heating or cooling during times when your grid is cleaner.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f764610-2616-11ec-9eff-db5273d5851a" alt="A sample of the Monthly Impact Report from Google&#39;s new Nest Renew Program on a laptop screen." data-uuid="89dc9725-ea94-3e77-a3d1-19943326816e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Because Google can now see how carbon-intense a grid is, it can start cooling, say, earlier in the day when solar energy is more available (and your home is approaching your temperature limit). Gleeson told Engadget that the company doesn&#39;t think people will notice a difference with this change, and stresses that &quot;customers are always in control.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If your thermostat kicks in before you want it to, you can always dial it back down, and you&#39;ll know the device is making a Renew-related decision thanks to a green leaf that will appear onscreen. For those whose energy provider charges based on time-of-use, this can also help you save money.</p><p>Nest has had the leaf symbol on its product for years as an indicator of more power-efficient temperature control. Now, you can earn leafs by doing things like using Energy Shift, joining monthly challenges to do things like running your laundry on cold. When you accumulate enough leafs to hit milestones, you can vote where Google sends its funds (from a list of its Energy Impact partners starting with non-profits <a href="https://gridalternatives.org/">GRID Alternatives</a> and <a href="https://www.elevatenp.org/">Elevate</a>).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e5f4270-2617-11ec-bbfb-c3e15b488e17" alt="A Nest Thermostat showing the message " data-uuid="5da1ee04-4396-36b2-9fd7-fa93c2147b7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In addition to automatic adjustments via your thermostat, Nest Renew will provide monthly &quot;impact reports&quot; that not only tell you the difference you&#39;re making, but also display when the electricity coming into your home is greener. With this data, you can choose to run the laundry, dishwasher or charge your devices earlier or later when your grid is cleaner.</p><p>Renew is a free opt-in program and works with the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-31-nest-thermostat-e.html">Nest Thermostat E</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-thermostat-2020-redesign-google-home-130-specs-pre-order-140039186.html">most recent Nest Thermostat</a>. Google is also offering a Premium tier for $10 a month in select parts of the US. It will unlock a Clean Energy Match feature that will exchange renewable energy credits (RECs) for what it estimates to be the same amount of fossil fuel-based electricity you use at home each month. This way, even if clean energy isn&#39;t available when you need to use it, you can at least assuage your guilt over using non-renewable power. Premium members will also get a unified bill that shows their monthly subscription to the program as well as their usual utility charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Gleeson said Nest has been working on this program for years, and in that time it has teamed up with utilities and energy providers to encourage enrollment in residential programs, among other things. For Nest Renew, it&#39;s teamed up with eight <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-glimpse-into-the-derms-vendor-ecosystem-and-solutions">Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS)</a> providers to help shape the program to meet their respective zero-carbon goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Nest Thermostats, increased visibility and marketing and relevant rewards programs, Google hopes to get more people enrolled  in green energy utilities offers and programs. The company also wants to help utilities &quot;bring more renewables online&quot; and accelerate the process either by supporting them in building or buying renewable infrastructure, according to head of energy partnerships Hannah Bascom.</p><p>Google&#39;s slew of sustainability-minded announcements today demonstrate a continued commitment towards the &quot;carbon-free future&quot; that CEO Sundar Pichai wrote about <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future/">a year ago</a>. In what Pichai called &quot;our third decade of climate action,&quot; Google plans to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7, help more than 500 cities reduce 1 gigaton of carbon emissions and enable its partners to reduce carbon emissions all by 2030. Nest Renew is a part of a wide-ranging set of updates today across Search, Maps and more to help Google&#39;s users make more-informed, environmentally friendly decisions.</p><p><strong><em>Update (at 11am ET):</em></strong><em> This article was edited to correct a spelling error in Bascom&#39;s last name.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74bad9e0-cc4a-4976-a457-6b8aa73fbabe</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633532531</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T15:02:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person using their right index finger to adjust the temperature on a Nest Thermostat, which shows the temperature at 74 degrees on its screen.

The internet giant is updating its search to provide information on more sustainable shopping and travel options. Look for energy-intensive appliances like hot water heaters or dishwashers, for instance, and you&#39;ll see suggestions for more sustainable (and frequently more cost-effective) products. A future update will also make it easier to cross-shop electric and hybrid cars, complete with identifying tags and a view of nearby compatible charging stations.</p><p>Google Flights, meanwhile, <a href="https://blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions">will show</a> the estimated CO2 emissions for &quot;nearly every&quot; flight, right down to the seat level.

Its aim is nothing less than to transform virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) production by making workflow simpler than current VR capture systems, while delivering the quality of a full-frame mirrorless camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The key product is the $1,999 RF5.2mm F2.8 L Dual Fisheye manual lens designed specifically to mount on Canon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">8K-capable EOS R5</a> camera. It&#39;s a highly unusual looking product, to say the least, with two bulging fisheye lenses mounted side by side. They&#39;re placed approximately 60mm (2.4 inches) apart to match human interpupillary distance and provide comfortable parallax for VR and AR.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/aa5daa20-265a-11ec-9dde-f26d15ab7d47" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a58436c1-ff22-3d47-ba29-b503f8e8749f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens works only with Canon&#39;s EOS R5, chosen for its 8K video capability. When shooting, it projects two circular images onto the camera&#39;s 45-megapixel sensor. It supports 190-degree capture, allowing for delivery of stereoscopic 180-degree 3D footage or photos at up to 8,192 x 4,096 (8K) resolution for AR or VR applications.&nbsp;</p><p>The lens has some unusual features, like a ring that focuses both lenses at once and an Allen screw adjustment that lets you tweak the focus of one lens to precisely match the other. Otherwise, you get features typically found in high-end Canon L RF mount glass, like coatings to control flare and ghosting, dust and water-resistant sealing and a solid F2.8 to F16 aperture range. Despite the odd looks, the lens is fairly compact and not much larger than Canon&#39;s 35mm F1.8 lens.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68668a40-265c-11ec-bcd7-232376631f48" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system" data-uuid="bf7dbb3d-bb68-3e8d-a249-a88954385a5c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens is just one part of the equation, though. Canon is working on a firmware update for the R5 with new features to support the lens and EOS VR system. That includes MF peaking and manual focus confirm via Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel autofocus system, along with a &quot;Magic Window&quot; UI that helps users plan for delivery to different types of headsets.</p><p>In addition, Canon made its own EOS VR Utility and EOS VR Plugin apps, each available by subscription for $5 per month (with a free trial period). The VR Utility app flips the stereo images left to right and converts them from circular to an &quot;equirectangular&quot; square image that can be viewed on a VR headset. It also offers quick editing tools like trimming of clips and application of a LUT, while letting you change to preset resolutions and file types (DPX, Pro Res, H264, etc.) prior to export.</p><div id="6df67d3f53124c17a9e391b2e55bc302"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJAr7SbVGBg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There&#39;s also the EOS VR plug-in for Adobe Premiere that &quot;will convert the dual fisheye imagery to equirectangular, while allowing the ability to cut, color, and edit with the full control of Premiere Pro,&quot; Canon told Engadget. It also lets you export footage to the desired spec for different types of delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of those apps, you&#39;ll be able to use the current Camera Connect app and Canon&#39;s EOS Utility to control capture. Both will be updated down the road to offer &quot;remote control live view functionality for monitoring purposes while on-the-go,&quot; Canon said in a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/20211006-product/20211006-product">press release</a>.</p><p>The system can be used for weddings, journalism, sports, training, events and more, while offering a number of advantages over current VR cameras. To start with, it&#39;s designed to deliver better quality than standalone VR cameras with smaller lenses and sensors like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-21-insta360-pro-2-8k-3d-vr-flowstate-stabilization.html">$5,000 Insta360 Pro 2</a>. At the same time, you get all the R5&#39;s tools like log shooting, RAW capture, 10-bit video and more. And when you&#39;re not using the VR lens, the R5 can be used for regular video production or photo shoots, unlike dedicated VR cameras.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/768e1d60-265a-11ec-a57f-7e26368f01f2" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a37a1b52-d134-3e8a-80aa-578b74ea69ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>At the same, the production process is simpler and cheaper than with dual cameras used in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-live-nba-is-coming-to-googles-vr-platform.html">higher-end productions</a>. Those cameras must be rigged, synced, focused and positioned correctly, with the end result being two files in many cases. Canon&#39;s EOS VR system, by contrast, delivers similar quality but offers focus and setup like a regular camera, while leaving you with a single file to edit at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire system isn&#39;t exactly cheap, considering you need to pay $1,999 for the lens and $3,899 if you don&#39;t already have an R5 camera, for a total of $5,898. However, considering how niche and unusual the lens is, it costs less than I expected. There&#39;s also the issue of R5 overheating that limits 8K recording times to 20 minutes, with a 10-minute recovery period. You can <a href="https://ymcinema.com/2021/08/29/canon-eos-r5-overheating-test-passed-more-than-1-5-hours-of-8k-raw-recording-time/">improve that</a> by capturing 8K to an external Ninja V+ RAW recorder, but that&#39;ll add $1,500 to your cost.</p><p>Still, it looks very promising for VR production, which has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/04/virtual-reality-usage-booms-in-the-workplace-amid-the-pandemic.html">boomed in popularity</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic (though still isn&#39;t exactly mainstream). It&#39;s been especially in-demand for business training and collaboration, a potentially rich vein for video producers. A lot of those folks, especially if they already have a Canon EOS R5, might be willing to jump into VR work if Canon&#39;s new system is as easy to use as it promises. The lens and EOS VR system are set to arrive in late December 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-introduces-its-new-vr-system-with-a-dual-fisheye-lens-040837782.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e38cab3-7d65-4227-8750-9ff89d80da2d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 04:08:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633513371</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T09:42:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
