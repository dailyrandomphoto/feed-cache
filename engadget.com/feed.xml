Residents can place orders through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/7Now/">7Now</a> app and an AV might bring the items to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-7-eleven-7now-pins.html">their location</a>.</p><p>Autonomous deliveries won&#39;t cost customers anything extra. They&#39;re available from 8AM until 9PM PT every day, and the companies say orders should arrive in around 30 minutes. When the AV arrives, customers collect their items from the rear. There are some limitations. You won&#39;t be able to order age-restricted items — such as alcohol, tobacco or lottery tickets — for autonomous delivery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nuro will initially use self-driving Priuses with a human operator monitoring the tech from the driver seat.

However, the company didn&#39;t want to reveal independent investigations into its executives, including the probe into Bill Gates. One of the proposal&#39;s key requests is the disclosure of executive-level investigations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the news that Bill and Melinda Gates were having a divorce, reports came out accusing the former of questionable behavior. The Microsoft co-founder allegedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html">pursued women</a> who worked for him at the tech giant and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, Microsoft&#39;s board of directors opened an investigation after discovering that he had an affair with an employee around 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The greater transparency around sexual harassment in the company was proposed by financial services provider Arjuna Capital. Natasha Lamb, a portfolio manager at Arjuna, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/microsoft-investors-vote-for-review-following-bill-gates-scandal">said during the meeting</a> that the investor is &quot;concerned about Microsoft&#39;s alleged continued culture of workplace sexual harassment and its history of unfulfilled previous commitments to resolve it.&quot; Arjuna said the reports about the probe into Gates&#39; affair and behavior that came out earlier this year &quot;put into question whether Microsoft was maintaining and protecting a culture of sexual harassment, especially seeing how Bill Gates was protected around this issue by the board.&quot;</p><p>Despite advising against voting for the proposal, Microsoft will take steps to comply with it. Company President Brad Smith said Microsoft will bring in a third party to assess its investigations and will share what those assessments contain. He also gave a taste of what the annual reports would include: Apparently, the tech giant received 51 complaints from employees in the fiscal year ending in June, and 47 percent of them were substantiated. The year before that, it received 142 complaints.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">115492f9-139e-43f4-a783-5ad04ea14dc2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 11:38:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638358754</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 27: CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella and CEO of Volkswagen, Herbert Diess (not seen) attend a session during their visit to Volkswagen Digital Lab in Berlin, Germany on February 27, 2019.

The company says firmware version 3.0.999.284 significantly improves the feature&#39;s performance, stability and accuracy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">HTC&#39;s Vive Focus 3</a> launched with hand tracking back in July, allowing users to use their hands as controllers. With this software engine upgrade, HTC says the headset will be able to track fast hand movements more easily and recognize pinch-to-zoom gestures more accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the company opened the feature to developers, these improvements would translate to better hand tracking within applications. Developers can integrate the headset&#39;s six current predefined hand gestures into their VR apps, and HTC previously <a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/support/focus3/category_howto/hand-tracking.html">said</a> that additional gestures will be added in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HTC said in its announcement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Being able to navigate virtual environments naturally and intuitively will go a long way towards making VR more accessible to everyone, no matter their familiarity with technology.

It&#39;s not a direct competitor to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-mobile-mixed-reality-camera-204734242.html">Quest 2</a>, however, seeing as it costs $1,300. Unlike the Oculus (now Meta) headset, it targets business users and not ordinary consumers who want to enjoy VR experiences in their own home.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-hand-tracking-update-090734043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20694278-b445-42b5-8b46-e444882e4825</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 09:07:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638349691</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T09:08:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virtual modular synth VCV Rack 2 is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://vcvrack.com/news/2021-11-30-Rack-2-released">VCV Rack 2</a> has arrived, and it could help you figure out if modular synthesis is something you can get into before blowing a fortune on it. The original app dropped in 2017, giving you access to thousands of virtual modules that let you try Eurorack for free. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-virtual-eurorack-synth-november-vst-plugin-superbooth-223810427.html">upgraded app</a> comes with a completely redesigned user interface with a dark room mode and a much better module browser than its predecessor. VCV has a library of almost 2,700 modules, and the new browser will make them easier to sort with its category filters and the capability to highlight the modules you use the most.</p><p>While the app itself is still free to download and use, there&#39;s now a Pro version that includes a VST plugin for full integration into the digital audio workstation of your choice. That means you&#39;ll be able to use VCV Rack within Ableton, Logic or even GarageBand. The Pro tier also comes with professional support — and the promise of more plugin formats in the future. Rack 2&#39;s paid version will set you back $99 until 2022, though you can also get it bundled with VCV Drums and VCV Sound Stage for $209. You can get both paid and free VCV Rack 2 versions right now from its <a href="https://vcvrack.com/Rack">official page</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="55250e107f2e40e0a46b5e69fcfbe1f7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYft3MFOCJQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-now-available-060611374.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9222d1d9-01b2-4ac4-b207-ca197d51f81a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 06:06:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638338807</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T06:06:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch will use machine learning to catch ban-dodging trolls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch is introducing a new machine learning feature to help streamers protect their channels from people attempting to avoid bans.

This year was no different with the company taking the opportunity to unveil the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. That’s right, for the second year in a row, Qualcomm is moving away from the sequential numbering scheme that has defined its processors for years. Just as the Snapdragon 865 gave way to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">888</a>, the company will now replace the 888 with the Gen 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The system-on-a-chip includes Qualcomm’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-10-gigabit-5g-modem-x65-151851346.html"><ins>X65 5G modem</ins></a>. The company says it’s capable of theoretical download speeds of 10Gbps. That’s one of those specs that’s impressive on paper, but won’t mean much out in the real world since some of the fastest 5G networks can’t deliver speeds greater than 4Gbps in ideal conditions. If you have access to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-linksys-wifi-6e-routers-now-available-130016648.html"><ins>WiFi 6 or 6E</ins></a> router, the Gen 1 can sustain download speeds of 3.6 Gbps over WiFi.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with its past flagship chipsets, Qualcomm has put significant effort into improving the camera experience. The Gen 1 features an 18-bit image signal processor. That’s a first for the company, and something it says allows the component to process 4,000 times more data than the 14-bit Spectra ISP found on the Snapdragon 888. Additionally, phones with the Gen 1 will have the ability to capture photos at 3.2 gigapixels per second. In practice, that means the Gen 1 can process data from three 36-megapixel cameras simultaneously without any shutter lag, according to Qualcomm.</p><p>In another first for a mobile device, the company says the chipset can record 8K HDR footage at 30 frames per second. Again, that’s not the most practical feature for a phone in 2021 since 4K is the top end for most content. On that note, the Gen 1 supports UHD capture at 120 frames per second and can record slow motion footage at 960 frames per second at 720p. Separate from its Spectra ISP, the Gen 1 includes a always-on image signal processor that can power a camera while consuming very little battery power. It’s a feature that will allow Gen 1-equipped devices to offer always-on face detection for biometric authentication.</p><p>The Gen 1 won’t offer greatly improved CPU performance over what was already possible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html"><ins>Snapdragon 888 Plus</ins></a>. What it does promise is faster performance when it comes to AI-related tasks. That’s thanks to Qualcomm’s new seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is up to four times faster than its predecessor thanks to more shared memory and a faster tensor accelerator. Gaming performance is another highlight of the Gen 1. According to Qualcomm, its latest Adreno GPU offers 30 percent faster rendering performance while consuming 25 percent less power. Over on the audio front, the Gen 1 includes support for Qualcomm’s recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html"><ins>aptX Lossless</ins></a> Bluetooth codec. It can deliver up to CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection.</p><p>Rounding out the Gen 1’s feature list is a dedicated Trust Management Engine. The Gen 1 is the first mobile chipset to support Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-ready-se-alliance-204241463.html"><ins>Android Ready SE</ins></a> standard out of the box, which means it has the capability to store things like digital car keys and IDs.</p><p>With its mix of performance improvements and new features, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 offers an intriguing look at the next generation of Android flagships. Now we have to wait to see what capabilities manufacturers decide to enable in their latest devices.

Before today, you needed special equipment to capture footage from that mixed reality perspective. With the new update, you can use your phone instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1a090250-521d-11ec-adff-c37d981c5147" style="height:1125;width:1125;" alt="Mobile mixed reality camera" data-uuid="2f6d72d8-e5ff-38b4-8da6-c37f18781354"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reality Labs</div></figure><p>Naturally, the final result isn’t as polished as the above video, but you can still get an idea of how games like <em>Beat Saber </em>play out in the real world. You’ll need an iPhone XS or above with iOS 11 or higher to use the new mobile mixed reality camera. With today’s release, about a dozen games support the feature, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-07-superhot-vr-feels-like-a-time-bending-action-packed-puzzle.html"><em><ins>Superhot VR</ins></em></a>, <em>Pistol Whip</em> and <em>Synth Riders</em>.</p><p>The update also includes a number of features Meta said were coming “soon” at its Connect conference in late October. To start, you can now make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-oculus-audio-calling-171524999.html"><ins>voice calls</ins></a> through the Messenger app on Quest and Quest 2 headsets. The feature allows you to not only call other Quest users, but you can also dial up your Facebook friends.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47e06420-521d-11ec-bfcf-3a775a8506e8" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Reality Labs app sharing" data-uuid="950773c6-6637-3725-902d-7619cff8168a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reality Labs</div></figure><p>Starting today, some games will also allow you to back up your save data to the cloud. The feature may not be immediately available on your headset after downloading the update. That’s because Reality Labs says it’s rolling it out at a slower pace to make sure it works correctly. Additionally, it’s an opt-in feature for developers, so not every game may support it even after it’s broadly available. While not new to the Quest platform, today’s update also removes the experimental tag that had been applied to the multi-user and app sharing features that were introduced at the start of the year.</p><p>Lastly, while not directly related to today’s update, in the “coming weeks” Reality Labs plans to introduce new customization options to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>. To start, you’ll have the option to choose from multiple virtual office environments and the ability to decorate the space with custom posters and your company&#39;s logo.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-mobile-mixed-reality-camera-204734242.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64552496-f253-44da-a554-27bccbfbb99e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 20:47:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638305260</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T20:47:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/feaff8b0-521c-11ec-a777-1e1105c372ab" width="1728" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/feaff8b0-521c-11ec-a777-1e1105c372ab" width="1728" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta Reality Labs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Quest Cloud Backups]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Quest Cloud Backups]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch now works with SharePlay on the iPhone and iPad]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch/">Twitch</a> has <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/appleshareplay?language=en_US#faq">rolled out</a> another feature designed to bring viewers closer together. The livestreaming service now supports <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html">SharePlay on iPhone and iPad</a>, so up to 32 people can watch the same stream while they&#39;re on a FaceTime call.</p><p>Everyone on the call will need to log in to the Twitch app — the service confirmed to Engadget that each person will count as an individual viewer. The first time you open a stream while you&#39;re on FaceTime, Twitch will ask whether you want to play it for yourself or everyone on the call, and it will remember your choice. If you choose to share it with everyone, SharePlay will sync the stream on everyone&#39;s devices, so they&#39;re all watching the same moment simultaneously. Play and pause controls will sync across devices too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11c8c17817c54d05a8de51c4bd628703"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Want to watch Twitch with all your friends?

Everyone will be able to interact with the streamer&#39;s chat, follow or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-reccuring-subscriptions-ios-215938996.html">subscribe to them</a> and send <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-27-twitch-cheering-beta-bits-currency-tips.html">Bits</a> from their own account. You can watch the stream in either portrait or landscape orientation but, at least for now, you can&#39;t continue a SharePlay session on Twitch&#39;s Apple TV app.</p><p>A SharePlay session ends when the stream is closed, you leave the FaceTime call or end SharePlay. If you close the stream, you&#39;ll be asked if you want to end it for yourself or everyone. Choosing the latter won&#39;t actually close the stream on everyone else&#39;s devices, but playback won&#39;t be synced.</p><p>Twitch is one of the biggest streaming platforms around. It&#39;s a welcome addition to the growing lineup of services that support SharePlay, which Apple rolled out last month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">in iOS 15.1</a>. Corralling a bunch of friends on a FaceTime call to watch some killer speedruns at Awesome Games Done Quick sounds like a fun way to spend time together, even when you&#39;re in your own homes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-shareplay-iphone-ipad-facetime-192948698.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7033decc-3b03-4485-883c-62385e90d190</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 19:29:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638310435</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T22:14:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41963d10-326a-11ec-b75f-f0fc283518ab" width="5756" height="3804" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41963d10-326a-11ec-b75f-f0fc283518ab" width="5756" height="3804" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - OCTOBER 6: The logo of "Twitch" is displayed on a smartphone in Ankara, Turkey on October 6, 2021.

They claim Google fired them for organizing worker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-24-google-faces-protest-over-worker-organization.html">opposition to controversial projects</a>, like working with the Trump-era Customs and Border Protection. They were supposedly punished for pointing out evil like Google as instructed, in other words.</p><p>The one-time employees claimed Google rejected the famous phrase as it was both expensive and leading workers to organize. The internet firm supposedly decided it was better to fire people than admit its approach had changed and give up the &quot;accompanying benefits&quot; that came with its well-known motto.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are concerns the lawsuit is too vague. What defines evil, exactly? However, plaintiff lawyer Laurie Burgess argued &quot;don&#39;t be evil&quot; was specific enough that it could be enforceable. The saying &quot;must have meaning&quot; if it was in the company code and thus binding, Burgess said.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Google for comment. It has previously accused all of the workers (plus Laurence Berland) of repeatedly violating data security policies by obtaining or sharing confidential data, but the workers and other critics have said this was just a cover for retaliatory action.</p><p>The lawsuit won&#39;t necessarily lead to stiff penalties.

The custom organisms can collect &quot;hundreds&quot; of individual cells in their dishes to spontaneously assemble baby bots that grow up within a few days. As this happens over and over, you could use the reproduction to amass however robots you need  to deliver drugs, remove microplastics from rivers or otherwise complete small-scale tasks.</p><p>The replication method is as notable as the bots themselves. The cells would normally develop into tadpole skin, but the computer-designed cell mix instead uses the &quot;kinematic&quot; (motion-based) replication normally seen only with molecules.

While the pressure leak never posed an immediate threat to those aboard, it set off a bizarre turn of events that saw Russia open an investigation to find out if the incident was the result of sabotage.</p><p>Per an <a href="https://ria.ru/20211126/kosmos-1760833889.html"><em>RIA Novosti</em></a> article spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/russia-threatens-criminal-charges-against-a-nasa-astronaut/?"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the country&#39;s Roscosmos space agency recently completed its probe of the event and sent the results to Russian law enforcement officials, opening the door for them to announce criminal charges. Roscosmos didn&#39;t&#39; say anything official about the cause of the pressure leak, but that hasn&#39;t stopped Russian media from spreading misinformation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>RIA Novosti</em> article references Russian media reports that allege the hole may have been drilled by NASA astronaut Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a crew member of the ISS at the time of the incident. Specifically, per Russia&#39;s <a href="https://tass.com/science/1366691"><em>TASS</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>news agency, the country&#39;s<em> Izvestia</em> newspaper claimed Aunon-Chancellor may have drilled the hole out of a &quot;desire to return to Earth because of a blood clot or a fight with her onboard the International Space Station.&quot; Citing its own source, TASS claims &quot;the hole had been drilled in weightlessness by a person not acquainted with the spaceship&#39;s design.&quot;</p><p>According to NASA, the possibility that its astronauts were involved in creating the pressure leak is non-existent. As <em>Ars Technica</em> notes, NASA knew the location of all of its astronauts before the leak started and the moment it began. None of the US astronauts aboard the ISS at the time of the incident were near the Russian compartment where the Soyuz was docked when it started leaking air. The US shared this information with Russia when Roscosmos began its investigation in 2018.</p><p>&quot;These attacks are false and lack any credibility,&quot; NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told the outlet. &quot;I fully support Serena and stand behind all of our astronauts.&quot; We&#39;ve reached out to NASA for additional information.</p><p>The accusations come at a time when the relationship between NASA and Roscosmos is already fraught. On November 15th, Russia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/russia-acknowledges-anti-satellite-test-but-says-its-no-big-deal/">conducted an anti-satellite missile test</a> that created a debris field that forced astronauts on the ISS to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-debris-field-215745675.html">seek shelter aboard their spacecraft</a>. The US condemned the trial, accusing the country of putting everyone aboard the ISS, including Russian cosmonauts, in danger.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roscosmos-2018-iss-report-174303244.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5643c07-1bf9-4b8c-a412-33a5cacfbf9b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:43:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638294833</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T17:53:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/61ed8110-5202-11ec-af7f-97b33c360db0" width="3408" height="2396" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/61ed8110-5202-11ec-af7f-97b33c360db0" width="3408" height="2396" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[International Space Station (ISS) crew member Serena Aunon-Chancellor of the U.S waves as she boards the Soyuz MS-09 spacecraft for the launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan June 6, 2018.

He said <em>Starfield </em>has &quot;two step-out moments.&quot; Many other games typically only have one of those, in which the player sees the expanse of an open-world environment for the first time.</p><p>There isn&#39;t a ton of detail about what Starfield is in this video, but it gives folks who are excited about the game a little more insight. There will be more episodes of &quot;Into the Starfield&quot; in the coming months as the release date edges closer. <em>Starfield</em> will arrive on November 11th, 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/starfield-featurette-bethesda-todd-howard-171417817.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f2c03a4-7c07-4b09-a5c5-de8158497721</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:14:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638292461</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T17:14:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d87df840-51fe-11ec-befb-4080686af7be" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d87df840-51fe-11ec-befb-4080686af7be" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bethesda Game Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A pilot of a spaceship shown from behind as they look out onto a rocky environment in 'Starfield.']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Starfield]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey took on Twitter’s biggest problems, but leaves plenty of challenges for his successor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a six-year stint as CEO (again), Jack Dorsey is leaving Twitter in a very different place than when he took it over in 2015. Back then, not everyone was excited about the return of the company’s cofounder. Even though he initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-11-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-out.html">came back</a> temporarily, employees and investors were concerned that dual CEO roles — he was, and still is, the CEO of Square — would keep him from being able to tackle the company’s many problems.</p><p>“The general feeling among Twitter employees now is trepidation,” <em>The New York Times </em>wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/technology/jack-dorsey-returns-to-twitter-as-chief-to-shrugs-and-quips.html">in 2015</a> of Dorsey’s surprise return. “Many are concerned at the prospect of Mr. Dorsey’s interim title becoming permanent, given his divisive and sometimes erratic management style and the fact that he had been dismissed and returned to the company before.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the time, the company was often described as being “in turmoil.” Twitter was churning through executives, and investors were concerned about lackluster user growth. Journalists and other pundits often noted that Twitter never knew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/twitter-tries-to-explain-itself-again-via-a-new-marketing-campaign-aimed-at-attracting-users/">how to explain</a> what it was or why it mattered. The actual service had barely changed in years. Harassment was rampant, and relatively unchecked.</p><p>Much has changed since then. Hand-wringing over Dorsey’s two jobs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html">never really</a> abated, but turnover at the top of the company eventually slowed, and Twitter started growing again. The platform still struggles with harassment, but has made a concerted effort at encouraging “<a href="https://about.twitter.com/en/our-priorities/healthy-conversations">healthy conversations</a>” and has significantly ramped up its policies against hate speech and harassment.</p><p>More recently, the company has undertaken a number of ambitious initiatives to change its core features and create new sources of revenue. In the last year alone, Twitter has introduced new features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-section-of-app-184333909.html">live audio</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-communities-170039437.html">groups</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tip-jar-201442453.html">payments</a>. It rolled out creator-focused features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-super-follow-subscriptions-180050731.html">Super Follows</a>, and acquired a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-revue-newsletter-subscribe-button-tweets-163814091.html">newsletter platform</a> for longform content. Last month, it introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html">Twitter Blue</a>, a subscription service aimed at power users. The company is also in the early stages <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html">of BlueSky</a>, a plan to create a decentralized standard for social media platforms.</p><p>But incoming CEO Parag Agrawal will still be inheriting significant challenges alongside all the shiny new projects. Though the company has made strides in increasing conversational “health,” it’s also grappled with where to draw the line between free speech and toxicity, particularly when political figures are involved. And, like other platforms, the company struggled to rein in misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 presidential election.</p><p>“Dorsey leaves behind a mixed legacy: a platform that&#39;s useful and potent for quick communication but one that&#39;s been exploited by a range of bad actors, including former President Donald Trump, who did his best on Twitter to undermine democracy—until Dorsey&#39;s people finally had enough and shut him down,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, who has researched social media polarization.</p><p>That Twitter under Dorsey did eventually permanently ban Trump has only made the company more of a target for politicians. And that’s unlikely to change just because Twitter’s new CEO has been one of the company’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-key-to-dorseys-plans-to-revamp-social-media.html">lowest profile</a> executives.</p><p>Agrawal is taking over as social media platforms face a bigger reckoning about their role in society. As lawmakers eye <a href="https://www.engadget.com/filter-bubble-transparency-act-house-introduction-200706847.html">regulating algorithms</a> and other reforms, Twitter has started to research <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-algorithms-amplify-the-political-right-but-it-doesnt-know-why-205859230.html">algorithmic amplification</a> and potential “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-will-study-algorithms-for-unintentional-harm-182722681.html">unintentional harms</a>” caused by its ranking systems. It will now be up to the company’s former CTO to steer that work while navigating scrutiny from lawmakers.</p><p>Agrawal will also inherit <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/twitter-sets-goals-to-double-revenue-reach-315-million-users-by-end-of-2023.html">ambitious goals</a> Twitter set earlier this year: To double its revenue and grow its user base to 315 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) by the end of 2023 (the company reported 211 million mDAU in its most recent earnings report). And there are some signs he may be well positioned to make that happen.

However, potential buyers were also shocked to learn that it has a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,200 starting price" href="https://fave.co/3El3BR2">$2,200 starting price</a>, compared to $1,449 for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-06-dji-mavic-2-pro-mavic-2-zoom-review.html">Mavic 2 Pro</a>. And that goes way up to $5,000 if you want advanced features like ProRes HQ video.</p><p>Early footage shows that the camera is indeed impressive and the 50 percent extra flight time is extremely useful. Buyers have also complained, though, about the price, overly basic Fly app and features like ActiveTrack 5 that won’t be available until a January 2022 update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I wanted to find out if it was worth that kind of money, particularly if you already have a Mavic 2 Pro. I’ve had the standard model for a couple of weeks and have been testing it around the French countryside with a licensed drone pilot, Samuel Dejours. Here’s what we found out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a153a7d0-513a-11ec-9f97-4908f06e84e4" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone" data-uuid="6280124e-7b7f-3f07-98eb-5476d64e7073"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I mentioned, there are two versions of the DJI Mavic 3: The standard model and the Cine. Both have identical cameras and drones, but the Mavic 3 Cine has a built-in 1TB SSD, MicroSD slot and Apple ProRes 422 HQ video support.  It also comes with the screen-equipped RC Pro remote, while the standard model includes the more basic RC-N1 that requires a smartphone.</p><p>ProRes 422 HQ is desirable for professional film shoots, because it delivers higher image quality and better color fidelity, especially for detailed scenes. The drawback is that it takes up a lot more space, using 1GB for around 10 seconds of video, for a total SSD record time of 167 minutes. The only way to get that footage off the drone is via the USB-C Thunderbolt port and supplied cable, but it can transfer at speeds very quickly, at up to 700MB/s.</p><p>The Cine model comes in a <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-mavic-3?vid=109821">bundle</a> with three batteries, a carrying bag, two sets of ND filters and more. As mentioned, it also costs $5,000, so you’d need a good reason to have those features. Since the Cine is aimed more at professional filmmakers, we tested the standard model in the $3,000 Fly More Combo. That includes three batteries, a charging hub, one set of ND filters and a nice carrying bag that converts into a backpack. It’s equipped with a MicroSD slot and 8GB of storage that’s only really useful for emergencies</p><p>Much like the Air 2S, the Mavic 3 folds into a compact, easy-to-carry size. It weighs 899 grams with a battery, slightly under the 907 gram weight of the Mavic 2 Pro. It has a slightly larger wingspan, as the arms are a hair longer to accommodate the bigger propellers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ca0e2380-513a-11ec-bfef-0a522d8f0e5a" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="967a3b2c-0633-3c9f-8029-bf680f4eb1e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Because of the dual camera system and larger main camera sensor, the camera module is bigger too. As a result, it protrudes a bit beyond the drone body, leaving it more exposed to damage in a crash.</p><p>The camera module itself no longer pans like the Mavic 2 Pro’s camera, so all panning must be done by moving the drone. However, it now tilts up 30 degrees, which can come in very handy for certain types of shoots, inspection work and so on. The camera locks when the drone is turned off, and is protected by a harness that my colleague jokingly called a bondage mask.</p><p>The Mavic 3’s battery is much larger than the one on the Mavic 2 Pro, at 5,000 mAh compared to 3,850 mAh. That, along with some aerodynamic tweaks, gives it a 50 percent boost in range from 31 to 46 minutes — a huge and incredibly useful gain. The 65-watt charger, now powered by USB-C, can juice up a battery in about an hour and 50 minutes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e494e900-513a-11ec-a5ff-566ec8749af5" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="9f8bd17e-fb0c-3a40-8d72-1b48aa98d435"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>DJI notes that flight time is 46 minutes with a hover time of 40 minutes. As you might expect, though, that depends heavily on the outside temperature and how you operate it. In sunny skies and lowish 47 degree F (8 degree C) temperatures, with a mix of sport, cinema and normal flying, we were easily getting about 35 minutes of range. That’s really good, and as a result, Samuel didn’t feel the need to rush as he sometimes does with his Air 2S or FPV. And those numbers should be considerably higher in the summertime.</p><p>Now, let’s get to the cameras. The primary camera was built by DJI in collaboration with Hasselblad and features a 24 mm f/2.8-f/11 lens and 4/3 sensor. For reference, that’s a third bigger than the one-inch sensor on the Mavic 2 Pro and the same size as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html">Panasonic’s mirrorless GH5 II</a> camera sensor, for instance.</p><p>The video specs are nearly as impressive as the GH5 II, as well. It can shoot 5.1K at 50 fps or 4K at 60 fps using the entire width of the sensor, yielding sharp, supersampled video. You can also shoot 4K at 120 fs if you don’t mind cropping of about 50 percent. That won’t be a big deal for most people, as 4K 120fps footage is extremely useful on a drone for action, wildlife, moving water and so on.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7a6fbce611004b0abcde2d133fb1c287" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0559e320-513b-11ec-b777-9691454dc46e" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price"></section><p>The larger sensor also delivers better low light performance, more detail, improved dynamic range and a more cinematic look in general. At the same time, the variable f/2.8 to f/11 aperture makes the camera more flexible in different lighting conditions. If you shoot in really bright sunlight a lot, however, I’d recommend getting the neutral density filter kit.</p><p>Shooting at ISO 1600 and 3200, we got clean footage with some noise in shadows and dark areas. However, the noise is well controlled and organic, so it’s not bothersome and can be tamped down with some mild noise reduction. Noise levels start to get excessive at ISO 6400, but that setting is still usable for night scenes if you don’t need a lot of shadow detail.</p><p>DJI boosted the H.264 data rate significantly from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps, and introduced H.265 capture at up to 140 Mbps. That’s an important update, as aerial footage captured by drones can have detail that confounds long-GOP (MP4) compression. As a result, quality is improved under most circumstances, and noticeably so for detailed shots.</p><p>That begs the question of whether you even need the ProRes option and 1TB SSD, considering the high price difference. I’d say that it’s a valuable feature for broadcast shooters, as it pushes the drone into professional territory. For others like YouTubers or industrial users, the H.264 quality is easily good enough.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/32896c30-513b-11ec-beee-82b2bea0f598" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="a04e090a-4ddc-35e6-a442-2a0ae43f20da"><figcaption>Taken with the Mavic 3 main camera.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 uses Hasselblad’s color profile that’s supposed to deliver accurate hues. In general, it performed well across the color spectrum, whether we were shooting in cities, coastlines or countryside. Skin tones are warm, and while you might not think that’s terribly important for a drone, the Mavic 3 could see a lot of use in weddings, documentaries and even movies. It’s so smooth that it can replace a crane or dolly for certain shots.</p><p>To max out dynamic range and editing flexibility, you can shoot 10-bit D-Log footage. Shooting directly into the sun and other tricky situations, I found that it allowed me to retain dynamic range and bring out extra detail in highlights and shadows.</p><p>One of the key new features of the Mavic 3 is the 162mm equivalent telephoto camera with a half-inch sensor. I’ve seen some confusion about zooming on the Mavic 3, so here’s how it works.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/24c76e20-513c-11ec-b57f-ba238764d678" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="acb2975e-7617-37eb-97fb-76cb34764c79"><figcaption>Shot with 7X telephoto (MP4).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>The main camera with no digital zoom is equivalent to a 24mm full-frame lens, or what DJI calls a 1X zoom. To zoom in further, you flip the drone into explorer mode on the Fly app. From there, you can either select discreet zoom settings (1X, 2X, 4X, 7X, 14X and 28X) or use a slider for in-between settings. Zooming up to four times is done digitally with the main camera, but the 4X zoom is very pixelated and not usable for any production work.</p><p>The 161mm, 12-megapixel f/4.4 telephoto camera kicks in at a 7X zoom, offering 4K video at up to 30 fps. It can digitally zoom up to 28X, but again, quality suffers. For the best-looking footage, you’ll need to stay between a 1X and 2X zoom, or go up to 7X exactly.</p><p>The Mavic 2 Zoom (not pro), by contrast, has a 24mm-48mm lens with a 2X zoom, while the Mavic 2 Pro has a fixed 28mm equivalent lens. The Mavic 3’s 7X zoom is more extreme, but does open up some interesting creative possibilities. However, the optical quality on that camera isn’t amazing given the smallish sensor size. In terms of professional use, then, it has limited value.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a73af7f0-513c-11ec-bb5e-f63bccd13581" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="57ed892b-cf8c-32c1-869f-a4d75d87d2d7"><figcaption>Photo shot with DNG and retouched in Lightroom.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the subject of JPEGs, it’s also a solid photo drone. I was a bit disappointed when I heard that the Mavic 3 had the same 20-megapixel sensor and less dynamic range than the Mavic 2 Pro (12.8 stops compared to 14 stops claimed). However, the larger pixels more than make up for that with improved light sensitivity and lower noise levels.</p><p>That said, you’ll want to make sure your footage is properly exposed. The Mavic 3 generally nails the exposure in automatic shooting modes, but it can get tripped up if you’re shooting into the sun. It helps to shoot using RAW DNG files, which give you much more latitude to adjust images in Lightroom.</p><p>Photo quality using the telephoto lens was better than the video quality, delivering crisp photos with good color accuracy, but with one key caveat. You can only shoot JPEGs and not RAW files, which limits your ability to adjust shots in post. Again, that makes the telephoto lens less useful for professionals. On the other hand, it could be extremely handy for other types of work, like inspections, search and rescue, bird spotting and so on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e6278500-513c-11ec-bb07-47b188e3d0f4" alt="DJI Mavic 3 Fly app" data-uuid="be3be9b4-42fa-3b5b-8350-d8014b1c6f38"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 is DJI’s easiest drone to fly, thanks to improved obstacle avoidance, and other features. It offers three flying modes: Cine, a slow flight mode for capturing smooth footage, Normal and Sport, the fastest setting.</p><p>The Mavic 3 works with DJI’s simplified Fly app, rather than the Go 4 app used with the Mavic 2 Pro. Camera settings like shutter, ISO, video resolution and so on are adjusted on the main flying screen at the bottom right. The record button and various video/photo settings (QuickShot, Hyperlapse, etc.) are found on the right side. For more advanced settings like Safety, Control, Cameras and Transmission, you have to dive into the three dot menu.</p><p>Once you fire up the app and connect your smartphone to the RC-N1 controller, you’re ready to turn on the drone. It plays a jaunty three-note tune on startup and is ready to go in less time than the Mavic Air 2S or 2 Pro.</p><p>When you take off, it remembers your home position for the RTH (return to home function). It maneuvers flawlessly, helping pilots easily capture smooth footage under manual control. It’s not quieter than the Mavic 2 or 2 Pro, but it has a slightly lower tone that’s less likely to disturb people or wildlife.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20446190-513d-11ec-bbfd-e2665b6bc355" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="fe8c64d8-4b6e-364d-9920-ef0897bba932"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s also faster, hitting speeds of up to 42 MPH in sport mode. Just remember that obstacle avoidance is disabled in that mode, so you’ll need to be careful to avoid (high-speed) crashes.</p><p>The Mavic 3 is covered with omni-directional sensors on the front, back, top and bottom. The app shows potential obstacles to help you avoid them, while the APAS 5 system lets you program the Mavic 3 to either stop when it encounters an obstacle or go around it.</p><p>We ran it through a gauntlet of hazards, including gnarly trees, power lines and more. It either stopped or dodged them, depending on the option we set. It did skim a leaf once while descending in RTH mode, though it didn’t phase the drone. However, it could indicate potential issues with the lower sensor array of the drone. The obstacle avoidance feature can be disabled in all modes, if you dare.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/449c9490-513d-11ec-b43e-fd2f44091f5f" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="c4e852e9-cd4b-39e4-993b-f7e9943e18f3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The RTH feature brings the drone back when the battery runs low, choosing the most efficient route possible. We found that it worked in all circumstances, even around tricky terrain and from miles away. The only drawback is that it doesn’t bring the drone back at a great speed, so many pilots may prefer to return manually in normal or sport mode.</p><p>One key feature that’s unfortunately not coming until January is ActiveTrack 5. As with DJI’s previous tracking systems, it’s designed to follow you around while you bike, windsurf and do other activities. The latest version is designed to track subjects no matter which way they’re moving and continue tracking even if they move out of frame. As this is an important feature, I may update this review later once I get a hold of it.</p><p>Other missing features include QuickShots to do fancy camera maneuvers like circles and boomerangs, along with MasterShots, designed to produce quick video clips for social media users. It also lacks the popular Panorama mode to create stitched photos, and QuickTransfer for rapid WiFi video and photo transfers.&nbsp;</p><p>This missing features aren&#39;t ideal, but delaying them at least allowed DJI to release the drone. Cameras from Sony, Canon and others often have key features added after the fact with firmware updates, so DJI isn&#39;t alone in doing this. Buyers will likely forgive the delays, but only if the updates arrive in January as promised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8c164f50-513d-11ec-927e-821e549db5dc" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="a2a6c5ff-ce26-38fe-a3ff-a16f83e682db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>With its starting $2,200 price tag, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Mavic 3" href="https://fave.co/3El3BR2">Mavic 3</a> is designed to take great videos and photos for professional and prosumer users. It strongly delivers in that regard, thanks to the pro-level sensor that delivers stunning image quality, along with stabilization that allows for insanely smooth shots. The ProRes video and 1TB internal SSD are also huge features for pro shooters.</p><p>It’s not perfect, though. Those same users may find the telephoto camera to be somewhat useless because it doesn’t deliver even close to the same level of quality as the main camera. They may also wonder why the standard model comes with a basic controller and limited Fly app, considering the relatively high price. The missing features like ActiveTrack 5 are a bummer, but once they arrive, everyone will quickly forget that they weren’t there at launch.</p><p>In terms of competition, DJI doesn’t have any peers when it comes to image quality (its tagline for the Mavic 3 is “Imaging Above Everything”). In other words, it’s laser-focused on cameras, as it recently showed with its crazy, amazing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html">Ronin 4D</a>. Other companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-skydio-2-review.html">Skydio</a>, however, arguably offer better flying drones with superior obstacle avoidance.</p><p>Should these factors impact your buying decision? I’ll leave the final word to Samuel, the professional photographer and certified pilot who owns multiple DJI drones and assisted in this review.</p><p>“I am definitely interested in buying it, because it has a sensor that’s larger and performs at a high level so it’s a big step up in terms of image quality. The extra battery life also makes planning easier, and the drone is extremely stable, even in wind, so you feel like you have a ‘tripod in the sky.’ It has some flaws for sure, but for me, those are outweighed by the image quality benefits.”</p><p><strong>Update 12/1/2021 3:15 AM ET</strong>: The post was updated to indicate that it&#39;s the Mavic 2 Zoom, not the Mavic 2, that has a 2x 24-48mm zoom lens. <em>Thanks Res!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-review-cinematic-power-at-a-price-150029600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">90a063b4-5e54-4648-bc37-0026d9ae35b5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638347078</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T08:24:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0a3429b0-5135-11ec-bebf-af44d847fd57" width="2000" height="1191" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0a3429b0-5135-11ec-bebf-af44d847fd57" width="2000" height="1191" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter bans sharing 'private' images and videos without consent]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter/">Twitter</a> has expanded its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-16-twitter-says-new-tools-automatically-flag-38-percent-of-abusive.html">private information policy</a> to include media, banning users from sharing photos or videos of a private individual without their permission.

Patient Steve Verze received the high-tech version as a permanent replacement for his traditional prosthetic eye. &quot;It makes me feel more and more confident,&quot; he told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbEFn2w8Pg"><em>On Demand News</em></a>. &quot;If I can&#39;t spot the difference, I know other people won&#39;t spot the difference.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Fraunhofer worked with British company Ocupeye Ltd on a new process that&#39;s faster and far less invasive. Previously, doctors would need to make a mold of the eye socket, something that&#39;s so difficult for kids that they need to go under a general anesthetic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b481f3dfda854ad79a8624abf60623c1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGbEFn2w8Pg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Now, the team can do a non-invasive 2.4-second scan using a specially modified ophthalmic scanner that delivers a precise measurement of the eye socket. That data is combined with a color-calibrated image of the healthy eye and transferred over Fraunhofer&#39;s &quot;Cuttlefish:Eye&quot; system, which rapidly creates a 3D print model. The software is particularly apt at making a &quot;realistic representation of even transparent materials,&quot; according to Fraunhofer.&nbsp;</p><p>The model is then printed out by a company called Fit AG which has experience in additive manufacturing for medical technology. From there, the prostheses are inspected and given a final polish and touchup by ocularists. &quot;With a single 3D printer, Ocupeye can potentially fulfil the annual requirement of around 10,000 prostheses required for the UK market,&quot; according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><p>Verze&#39;s prosthetic is a precursor to a forthcoming clinical trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of 3D printed eyes vs. traditional, hand-made eyes, according to <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2021/nov/first-patient-fitted-3d-printed-eye">University College London</a>. Around 40 patients will be recruited two assess the prostheses for motility (movement), cosmesis (look), fit, comfort, mucous discharge and more. &quot;This new eye looks fantastic and, being based on 3D digital printing technology, it’s only going to be better and better,&quot; Verze said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/patient-receives-a-fully-3-d-printed-eye-for-the-first-time-ever-142528877.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80ade9a6-f61c-4ff2-9d4c-422fa651aec6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638282216</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T14:23:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eye Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f5e52790-51e1-11ec-9eff-5477bc17e959" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f5e52790-51e1-11ec-9eff-5477bc17e959" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fraunhofer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Patient receives a fully 3D-printed eye for the first time ever]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Patient receives a fully 3D-printed eye for the first time ever]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ninja's 10-in-1 multicooker is 41 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry if you missed out on Black Friday multicooker deals — there are still big bargains available.
