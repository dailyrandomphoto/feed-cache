Thankfully, that won&#39;t be an issue for long. Warpfrog has <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/innovative-physics-based-combat-game-blade-sorcery-nomad-is-coming-to-oculus-quest-this-november/">unveiled</a><em>Blade &amp; Sorcery: Nomad</em>, a stand-alone game coming to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2</a> on November 4th for $20. The basic concept remains the same — it&#39;s a &quot;sandbox&quot; brawler with immersive swordplay and magic — but the developers are taking advantage of the freedom that comes with a stand-alone headset.</p><p>The familiar Sandbox mode is now fine-tuned for room-scale VR. There&#39;s also a Dungeons mode that challenges you to fight through &quot;semi-procedurally generated&quot; chambers. In 2022, there will also be a mode with progression that rewards frequent play.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This probably won&#39;t get you to spring for a Quest 2 by itself. It might tip the balance if you were already curious about titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-san-andreas-vr-oculus-quest-2-174846796.html"><em>GTA: San Andreas</em></a>, though, and it may serve as a good introduction to what VR can do.

Facebook is looking to grow the availability of content for VR learning as part of its efforts to shift its focus on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">metaverse</a>, and it has created a US$150 million fund to achieve that goal. The social network has announced that it&#39;s spending that much to reach its VR learning goals over the next three years at its Connect 2021 event.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Facebook is hoping to  build a robust ecosystem for learning in the metaverse, it plans to do more than just create immersive educational experiences. Part of the money will go towards training augmented reality and virtual reality creators, so they can make their own experiences. Facebook is working with Unity to teach people the skills necessary to create educational VR content — mainly, it&#39;s using Unity&#39;s &quot;Create with VR for Educators&quot; tool with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oculus-quest-2-128gb-now-available-180638366.html">Quest 2</a> devices to teach nonprofits and educational institutions. In addition, it&#39;s working with several educational institutions, including historically Black colleges and universities, as well as non-profits to create immersive experiences for them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, Facebook says it&#39;s taking steps towards increasing people&#39;s access to educational VR materials. After all, all that work will go to waste if nobody ends up using them to learn new things.</p><p>Mark Rabkin, VP of Oculus, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;VR isn’t all fun and games. If you’ve ever traveled the world with Wander, explored Japan with Tokyo Origami, or admired the heavens in Titans of Space PLUS, then you know that VR can be a powerful tool for education as well...A lot of work exists between where we’re at now and where we see the metaverse in the future. We’re excited, and we hope you’ll come with us on the journey.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-150-million-vr-learning-fund-171537678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a54e515-7b03-458e-9208-c6b5b62bea98</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:15:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635424197</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T12:30:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a876440-37e3-11ec-b6cf-8498eb292ac5" width="1600" height="897" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a876440-37e3-11ec-b6cf-8498eb292ac5" width="1600" height="897" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Parkline Interactive, LLC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wander]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wander]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's Polar app will let anyone design AR objects and effects]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its broad vision of becoming a metaverse-focused company, Facebook announced Polar, a free iOS app that makes it easy for just about anyone to create AR filters, effects and 3D objects. Think of it like an easy-to-use implementation of the company&#39;s Spark AR platform for developers. The goal is to give creators a simple tool to design custom AR effects — perhaps glowing demonic eyes, or 3D text of your personal hashtag or slogan — that they can deploy across the web, or share with their followers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company plans to launch a closed beta program later this year, so it&#39;ll likely be a while before it&#39;s open to everyone.

Instead, as Mark Zuckerberg described to media ahead of today&#39;s Facebook Connect conference, the company is betting it&#39;ll be the next major computing platform after the rise of smartphones and the mobile web.</p><p>After spending the last decade becoming obsessed with our phones and tablets — learning to stare down and scroll practically as a reflex — the Facebook founder thinks we&#39;ll be spending more time looking up at the 3D objects floating around us in the digital realm. Or maybe you&#39;ll be following a friend&#39;s avatar as they wander around your living room as a hologram. It&#39;s basically a digital world layered right on top of the real world, or an &quot;embodied internet&quot; as Zuckerberg describes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before he got into the weeds for his grand new vision, though, Zuckerberg also preempted criticism about looking into the future now, as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html">Facebook Papers paint the company </a>as a mismanaged behemoth that constantly prioritizes profit over safety. While acknowledging the seriousness of the issues the company is facing,  noting that it&#39;ll continue to focus on solving them with &quot;industry-leading&quot; investments, Zuckerberg  said:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f4714630-380c-11ec-be1b-72b698ac97e3" alt="Oculus Quest 2" data-uuid="c0afc1f0-5415-3dba-a7c5-7f83f36e9e76"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;The reality is is that there&#39;s always going to be issues and for some people... they may have the view that there&#39;s never really a great time to focus on the future... From my perspective, I think that we&#39;re here to create things and we believe that we can do this and that technology can make things better. So we think it&#39;s important to to push forward.&quot;</p><p>Given the extent to which Facebook, and Zuckerberg in particular, have proven to be untrustworthy stewards of social technology, it&#39;s almost laughable that the company wants us to buy into its future. But, like the rise of photo sharing and group chat apps, Zuckerberg at least has a good sense of what&#39;s coming next. And for all of his talk of turning Facebook into a metaverse company, he&#39;s adamant that he doesn&#39;t want to build a metaverse that&#39;s entirely owned by Facebook. He doesn&#39;t think other companies will either. Like the mobile web, he thinks every major technology company will contribute something towards the metaverse. He&#39;s just hoping to make Facebook a pioneer.</p><p>&quot;Instead of looking at a screen, or today, how we look at the Internet, I think in the future you&#39;re going to be in the experiences, and I think that&#39;s just a qualitatively different experience,&quot; Zuckerberg said. It&#39;s not quite virtual reality as we think of it, and it&#39;s not just augmented reality. But ultimately, he sees the metaverse as something that&#39;ll help to deliver more presence for digital social experiences — the sense of being there, instead of just being trapped in a zoom window. And he expects there to be continuity across devices, so you&#39;ll be able to start chatting with friends on your phone and seamlessly join them as a hologram when you slip on AR glasses.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1fb2bae0-380d-11ec-9fb7-d943e53347f6" alt="Facebook Horizon Home" data-uuid="8f7b5a69-28c9-33ff-aa83-1664db0bbf25"><figcaption>A simulated preview of Horizon Home.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>But, of course, the metaverse won&#39;t be built in a day. At Facebook Connect today, the company announced several ways it&#39;s moving towards making it more accessible. For one, Facebook will be transforming the Oculus Quest&#39;s Home interface into &quot;Horizon Home,&quot; a more fully featured environment where you can invite friends and hang out virtually. Eventually, you&#39;ll also be able to build and customize your home space. The Venues app is also becoming &quot;Horizon Venues,&quot; where it&#39;ll continue to serve as Facebook&#39;s prime spot for live virtual events. (The company also says NBA games are coming back to Venues in early November.)</p><p>The company is also making a major push for developers: its new Presence Platform offers through APIs that&#39;ll allow devs to make more inventive VR apps. The Insight SDK will let them take advantage of the Quest 2&#39;s cameras to bring the real world into VR; the Interaction SDK opens up the door for more hand-tracking interactions; and the Voice SDK will — you guessed it — let you use your words in more ways.</p><p>The Insight SDK, in particular, could reshape what Quest VR experiences could look like. It includes Spatial Anchors, which will let virtual objects persist across sessions in a space. So if you placed a VR pet bunny on your coffee table, it should always be there every time you logged into an app. Additionally, there&#39;s a Scene Understanding feature, which can help developers get a better sense of your physical space. A character talking to you in VR could, for example, wander around your living room without bumping into furniture.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/636b9d10-380d-11ec-b7fa-ba41df68fd38" style="height:812;width:374;" alt="Facebook Polar" data-uuid="812a27a4-cd60-392c-b8de-b2ba958f87f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p></p></div><p>When it comes to augmented reality, Facebook also has plenty of upgrades in store for its Spark AR platform. For one, it&#39;s planning to launch an iOS app called Polar that&#39;ll let people design their own AR effects and objects without any coding. It&#39;s aimed at creators, who could use it to build unique 3D signage or makeup effects that their followers can apply. More experienced devs will also be able to create Geo-anchored objects, which are tied to specific locations in the real world, as well as AR effects that track your hands and body. They can also try out building group video chats for Messenger, something that&#39;ll eventually be supported in other apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Like HoloLens and HTC Vive, Facebook plans to make a bigger push into enterprises with Quest for Business. It&#39;s a way for employees to log into Quest 2 headsets with secure work accounts (it&#39;s probably not great for your boss to see how often you&#39;re playing <em>Beat Saber</em>, after all). Since they&#39;re meant for office environments, IT departments will also be able to manage work accounts, specific devices and integrate their own security features. The key is that it&#39;s all going to be accessible on consumer-grade Quest 2 headsets, Facebook won&#39;t have to make entirely new hardware for work environments.</p><section data-eng-breakout="60b0b0b3b0234adc9714b50aaf40a785" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd4463c0-00b3-11ec-a8fb-bb128f10ddf0" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms"></section><p>The company plans to take it slow with Quest for Business. It&#39;s currently being tested with a few companies now, and a wider beta is expected to come next year. At this point, Facebook isn&#39;t planning to officially roll it out to every company until 2023. Quest for Business will replace the previous <a href="https://business.oculus.com/">Oculus for Business program</a>, which required a special $799 Quest 2 headset.</p><p>Facebook already showed off one way remote meetings could be handled better with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>, and that app is going to get better later this year with customizable workrooms. And when it comes to productivity, the company is also opening up the Oculus Store to 2D apps like Slack, Dropbox, Instagram and Facebook. You&#39;ll be able to dive into those apps right from your Horizon Home screen. It&#39;s convenient, but it&#39;s also a cheeky way to keep you from taking off your headset just to answer a Slack message.</p><p>Not everyone would want to spend a whole workday wearing a VR headset, but it&#39;s not hard to imagine how future AR glasses could let you dive into Slack and Office apps just about anywhere. They&#39;ll just be 2D projections floating around you, things that nobody else would be able to see. That may seem like science fiction today, but 15 years ago, so did the idea of having a touchscreen-enabled supercomputer in your pocket with blazing fast wireless internet.&nbsp;</p><p>As Zuckerberg sees it, the metaverse will ultimately lead to a more natural relationship with technology (while, of course, giving us another way to buy digital goods). &quot;It&#39;s not about you spending more time on screens,&quot; he told press before making a hasty retreat. &quot;It&#39;s about making the time we spend better and I think you know screens can&#39;t really convey the full sense of presence.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2ddde43-d0e2-4528-865f-cdb67d41e4d7</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:15:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635442920</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T17:42:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2d1e7811-380b-11ec-9f3d-ab62c22a5449" width="1996" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2d1e7811-380b-11ec-9f3d-ab62c22a5449" width="1996" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Spark AR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Spark AR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Fi will soon offer end-to-end encrypted calls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a Google Fi subscriber, the next time you phone someone your call may be protected by end-to-end encryption.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh6-development-announcement-140038779.html">$2,500 GH6</a>, due to arrive later this year, has major upgrades like 4K 120p and even 5.7K video. The other is the model I’m reviewing today, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,700 GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">$1,700 GH5 II</a>.</p><p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-10-bit-60p-video-140057920.html">GH5 II</a> is more of a refresh, with the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor. However, it has an all-new processor that delivers significant improvements in speed, video quality and AI smarts. Best of all, it’s $300 less than the GH5 was at launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The big question is whether it’s worth getting this model, waiting for the GH6, or even purchasing an older GH5 that’s now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Megapixel-DC-GH5-Accessories/dp/B079TC31FC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=panasonic+gh5&amp;qid=1633010814&amp;sr=8-4">steeply discounted</a>. To find out, I tested the GH5 II’s new features, video quality, autofocus and more — here’s what I found out.</p><h3>Body and handling</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0b3f2bd0-3730-11ec-9ffe-034a1b3053bd" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="35f45301-980c-3cb3-949d-ddd1cf4783b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already familiar with the GH5, you’ll be very comfortable with the GH5 II — the bodies are nearly identical. That’s a good thing, because it still out-handles many newer cameras, thanks to the excellent grip and logical control positions.</p><p>There are a few key changes, though. While the rear display is a little smaller at 3 inches instead of 3.2 inches, it has slightly more resolution and is significantly brighter. That fixes one of the biggest issues with the GH5: its relatively dim display.</p><p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) carries the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification, but has double the refresh rate at 120Hz. That makes a noticeable difference in image quality; more so than a resolution bump in my opinion. However, it also drains the battery a touch faster.</p><p>Another nice improvement is the addition of USB-C PD compatibility that can charge the battery more quickly. And it comes with a more powerful DMW-BLK22 battery, the same one found in the company’s full-frame S5 camera. While it’s still CIPA-rated for 410 shots like the GH5, it delivers a few more minutes of video recording.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/316938a0-3730-11ec-8fbe-ec6d9268d555" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="17cd8e31-431c-397a-ba01-d4f14b7ced74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II has better menus than the GH5, gaining those introduced on the GH5s. It’s a color coded, tabbed menu system with hints to find the option you’re looking for. It also has the info panel from Panasonic’s pro Varicam models (also available on the GH5s), that show important settings at a glance. Another feature for pro shooters is dual zebra controls that let you check two levels at once, like highlights and skin tones.</p><p>As with the GH5, the new model has dual UHS II card slots, but they now support the maximum V90 (300 MB/s) speeds. That’ll ensure stable capture if you’re using the new All-I 4K video settings at up to 400 Mbps, or let the buffer clear faster if you’re snapping photos.</p><h3>Video performance</h3><p>There are several subtle, but important changes to the video capabilities of the GH5. A key one is an update to the image stabilization system. It now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection, up by 1.5 EV over the GH5. When working with compatible lenses and using the IS boost mode, it’s designed to provide more steady shots, even if you’re walking or moving.</p><p>No in-camera stabilization system is ever going to beat a gimbal. However, the GH5 II does a better job than most mirrorless cameras I’ve tried at smoothing out walking or running, provided you’re reasonably careful. More importantly, it makes handheld camera pans and other motion smoother than the GH5 does. If you need some extra stabilization, there’s an electronic mode that does help, though it crops in slightly.</p><p>Another key change is with the autofocus system. In general, continuous autofocus for video is faster and smoother than before, though you’ll still see a tiny bit of hunting or wobble that’s unavoidable with a contrast-detect-only AF system. As before, the system works better at higher frame rates when it has more information to work with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/82b52430-3730-11ec-9fae-b3e7740ba060" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="cd30be5e-f983-3673-ac26-862eee30c01f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II also brings some AI autofocus smarts that couldn’t be added via firmware to the GH5 because of its relatively old processor. It offers double the face and eye-tracking speeds, and can pick up focus when a face is tilted away from the camera. It can recognize heads and human bodies, making tracking more feasible if a person is turning or moving towards or away from the camera. It adds new animal tracking features that can handle most pets and some types of wildlife, as well.</p><p>With these features enabled, it’s easier to keep someone in focus if they or you are moving. Again, this works best at higher frame-rates, but overall, the improved focus hit rates make the camera more practical for vlogging or run-and-gun work, especially for solo operators. Animal tracking is also pretty useful, particularly if pets and/or kids are running around.</p><p>Is the GH5’s subject tracking as good as on Canon or especially Sony’s latest mirrorless cameras? No, because both of those brands use phase-detect systems that can nail focus directly without any wobble. Sony’s latest models, particularly the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">A1</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, also have uncannily fast tracking capabilities that Panasonic has yet to match. Still, the new model is a big step up from the GH5 and certainly good enough for many types of projects.</p><h3>Video quality</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ad4d3980-3730-11ec-aefb-a18108dccf82" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="883625b7-0d4f-3a48-adca-7b8907b1e6a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Video made the GH5 popular, as it was far ahead of the competition for the price when it first arrived. Five years on, it’s getting pretty old, though, so a new processor helped Panasonic boost the GH5 II’s specs in line with what it’s done on full-frame models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-full-frame-mirrorless-review-140006301.html">S5</a>.</p><p>To that end, the new model now offers 10-bit 4:2:0 4K and C4K (4,096 x 2,160) video at up to 60 fps, rather than just 8-bit video at 60p as before. That makes it better for slow-mo or high frame-rate video if you want to use log or HDR video settings. Like the GH5, it can also handle 6K 30p anamorphic (4,992 x 3,774) with 10-bit, 4:2:0 color settings. And where All-I capture was limited to 24/25 fps on the GH5, the GH II can now do it at up to 30 fps.</p><p>Though the GH5 II comes with VLog-L shooting out of the box, it&#39;s limited to 12 stops of dynamic range rather than 13 like Panasonic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html">BGH1 box camera</a> and other recent models. Panasonic also introduced two new video modes, Cinelike D2 and Cinelike V2, that let you shoot log-like video with less hassle. Those deliver slightly more saturated colors and improved skin tones than the original Cinelike D and V modes.</p><p>Like other newer models, the GH5 II shows a red frame around the screen while recording, along with aspect ratio guides and a TikTok-style portrait video mode.  With the same sensor, the GH5 II has pretty much the same readout speeds, so as before, rolling shutter is present but well controlled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62cf1860-3730-11ec-bdff-8ba32f7298ca" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="f4a10862-ffc3-3dcf-89d3-c6a23d2b33a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II can now capture video simultaneously to an external recorder over the HDMI port, unlike the GH5. However, it can’t capture RAW video like the S5, for instance. Hopefully, that and the limited VLog-L dynamic range will be addressed in future firmware updates.</p><p>With all those tweaks, the GH5 II delivers sharp video with high levels of color accuracy for demanding work. It handles skin tones well and colors are natural and accurate. Low-light shooting is not its strong point, though, due to the smaller sensor size. For that, you’d be better off with either the GH5s or one of Panasonic’s newer full-frame models.</p><p>The new video quality changes are subtle, but could be helpful for certain types of work. Overall, it delivers the video quality everyone liked from the GH5, plus a little more.</p><h3>Live Streaming</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/53ed5270-3731-11ec-bf7f-1cc652ccecd8" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="de71b920-c14b-392f-9191-857baebd917e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>A key new feature for the GH5 II is the ability to broadcast live on the web, either using WiFi or a USB-C. The latter will require a firmware update that essentially allows the GH5 II’s USB-C port to be used as a wired LAN connection, however.</p><p>You can either stream to a smartphone via WiFi using the Lumix Sync app, or stream directly over WiFi without the need for a PC or phone. The latter requires you to use the Lumix Network software for PC or Mac to write your streaming settings to an SD card. Since it uses the RTMP/RTMPS standard, it supports YouTube, Facebook and other services. Better still, it supports camera audio as well as video.</p><p>Live streaming does require a robust connection, however, as I struggled to maintain a livestream in the countryside with a 16 Mbps connection. You won’t want to use the maximum 1080p 60 fps settings unless you have internet speed well above 16 Mbps.</p><h3>Photos</h3><section data-eng-breakout="ccd8c65a80324179a12754d860d7fb81" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/73100e40-3731-11ec-bdb5-7d64568fbb8e" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers"></section><p>With the same sensor as the GH5, the GH5 II delivers much the same image quality and photo shooting specs, including 12 fps burst shooting speeds. Where it has improved, though, is in the autofocus features, particularly with tracking.</p><p>The G9 was always a better photo camera than the GH5, as it had a noticeably quicker autofocus system. However, the GH5 II’s new processor means faster AF calculations, so the hit rate with continuous burst shooting is higher. It can also do face and eye tracking more quickly, and as with video, can handle head and body tracking, too.</p><p>With those changes, I was able to get more burst action shots in focus than I could with the GH5, whether shooting people, dogs or horses. At the same time, it tends to nail exposure more accurately than the original model.</p><p>Image quality is largely along the same lines as video, with low-light capability that gets pretty noisy above ISO 3200 or so, but sharp, color-accurate photos in good light. As before, it’s best not to let your highlights get too blown out as they’re difficult to recover when shooting RAW.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91c64ca0-3731-11ec-bedf-c47f454a2751" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="e7abee3b-dd6b-3694-ac4d-4ff286aab26c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">GH5 II</a> is a worthy upgrade to the original, bringing enough improvements and new technology to justify its existence. Given that the all-new GH6 model is coming soon as well, it’s clear that Panasonic is still committed to small sensor, video-centric mirrorless cameras.</p><p>Video has modestly improved, and it’s better for handheld shooting thanks to the improved stabilization. Autofocus is still a drawback but it’s faster and more reliable than before. It would be nice if it supported RAW external capture, but that’s probably not a dealbreaker for most users. It can handle stills reasonably well, though it’s not the camera’s strong point.</p><p>Other cameras have caught up with the GH5 II in terms of video performance, but most, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">Canon R6</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,500" href="https://fave.co/3vRGFFX">$2,500</a>) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-latest-z-6-ii-firmware-unlocks-4-k-60-fps-recording-110552464.html">Nikon Z6 II</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,000" href="https://fave.co/32xdGsT">$2,000</a>) are more expensive. Fujifilm’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,700" href="https://fave.co/3sDfATK">$1,700</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t4-mirrorless-camera-review-140024236.html">X-T4</a> is a better choice if you want a larger sensor and shoot a lot of photos, but it lacks the streaming capabilities. Its biggest rival may be the original GH5 that can now be found for $1,300, if you don’t need the video streaming or other features. In any case, the GH5 II is now the best Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera for video. At least until the GH6 comes along.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e5cacee-5a87-4ea8-97fc-fccdd8fb90c4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:46:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635440779</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T17:06:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard ends forced arbitration for harassment and discrimination claims]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following months of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-activision-walkout-184945869.html#"><ins>pressure from employees and workers</ins></a>, Activision Blizzard says it will no longer employ forced arbitration in sexual harassment and discrimination claims. CEO Bobby Kotick announced the policy change in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005446/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-Regarding-Progress-and-Commitments-Made-at-Activision-Blizzard"><ins>letter to employees</ins></a> the company shared on Thursday. Kotick said the publisher will also implement a new company-wide zero-tolerance harassment policy. In the future, any employee who is found to have violated the rule will be fired immediately. Additionally, they’ll forfeit any future compensation, including equity awards.</p><p>“Our goal is to have the strictest harassment and non-retaliation policies of any employer, and we will continue to examine and tighten our standards to achieve this goal everywhere we do business,” Kotick said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The executive outlined three other steps Activision Blizzard will take to create a safer and more diverse workplace. Over the next 10 years, it will invest $250 million in programs that create opportunities in tech and gaming for under-represented communities. Additionally, the company to plans to hire more women and non-binary people. According to Kotick, approximately 23 percent of all employees at Activision Blizzard identify as part of those groups. Its goal is to increase that number by 50 percent to more than one-third across the entire company within the next five years. Kotick also promised the company will share annual reports on progress it makes toward pay equity.</p><p>Separately, the executive said he has asked Activision Blizzard’s board of directors to reduce his total compensation to $62,500 per year until it feels like he has met the diversity and safety goals outlined above.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees Kotick and Activision Blizzard meeting many of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?s=20">demands</a> employees put before the company when they began protesting its actions in the wake of California’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sexual harassment lawsuit</ins></a>. When employees first staged a walkout in July, they demanded the end of forced arbitration, greater pay transparency and new hiring policies designed to increase representation across the company. “This is a great start, and there’s still work to do,” <a href="https://twitter.com/blizzjess/status/1453734464308211714">said Jessica Gonzalez</a>, one of the employees involved with the A Better ABK advocacy group. “We can lead the charge as an industry standard.

That&#39;s $40 off its normal price and the lowest we&#39;ve seen in a long time. The second-gen <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub" href="https://fave.co/3jLXCN8">Nest Hub</a> is half off, bringing it down to $50, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub Max" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW">Nest Hub Max</a> is on sale for $180.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3mQeJzP" id="7a43bee84fbe4b2e8913ee5325e94733" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Audio at B&amp;H - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jLXCN8" id="37c650f19deb4d89af1daa3dd3a16324" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub (2nd gen) at B&amp;H - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW" id="5b6f6dc4f90a4e7a8be54350b07695ad" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub Max at B&amp;H - $180</a><p>If you&#39;re an Android user or a Google Assistant fan, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Nest Audio as your main smart speaker. It earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">score of 87</a> from us and we considered it to be a steal at its normal $100 price point. Not only does it have solid sound quality on its own, but two paired together in stereo mode sound even better. We also like its minimalist design and how speedily the Google Assistant responds to commands.</p><p>Either of the Nest Hubs on sale would make great additions to your smart home, but which you choose will likely depend on how much you value affordability and sound quality. The second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a> is a great deal at $50 because you&#39;re getting a faster device overall, much improved audio quality and new sleep tracking abilities. For the latter, if you put the Nest Hub next to your bed, it&#39;ll track how long you&#39;ve been asleep and even if you snore during the night. And regardless of where it sits in your home, the smart display can show video camera feeds from Nest Cams, so you can see who&#39;s at your front door without actually answering it.</p><p>As for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a>, it&#39;s the better choice if you want a smart display that can also hold its own against some high-end speakers. It includes two front-facing tweeters and a rear-facing woofer and they work together to pump out strong, clear sound. It&#39;s not a replacement for a couple of Sonos speakers spread throughout your home, but it&#39;s one of the best options if you want one device that can be your main speaker and smart display.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-hits-new-low-of-60-at-bh-photo-150717380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0dc978d5-0f49-4380-b519-6402f20fc86a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:07:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635442748</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T17:39:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio smart speaker sitting on a wooden tablet next to a green plant, against a blue wall.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ is coming to Comcast devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick.html">Apple TV app</a> has reached its final frontier: your cable provider&#39;s set-top box. <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/apple-tv-plus-comcast-xfinity-video-platforms-1235099517/">According</a> to <em>Variety</em>, Comcast used its latest <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call">earnings call </a>to reveal that the Apple TV app will be available on Comcast&#39;s platforms in the &quot;coming months.&quot; Viewers with Xfinity X1 set-tops, Flex streaming hubs, XClass TVs and (in the UK and Europe) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html">Sky Glass</a> sets will have access to Apple TV+, in-app channels (like AMC+ and Showtime) and Apple&#39;s usual video purchases and rentals.</p><p>In exchange, Comcast is bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-14-comcasts-all-in-one-xfinity-stream-app-arrives-february-28th.html">Xfinity Stream</a> app to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV hardware</a>.

But now you can get one of Shark&#39;s most advanced models for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs">Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum</a> with clean base is 47 percent off, bringing it down to $319. That&#39;s more than $280 off its normal price and the lowest we&#39;ve seen it — not to mention that also makes it even cheaper than most iRobot devices that come with clean bases, even when they&#39;ve been on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs" id="6372afd8974f4916b8e5ff731b09b34f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ RV1001AE at Amazon - $319</a><p>We&#39;ve been fans of Shark&#39;s robot vacuums since one of its cheaper models made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>. Originally priced at $600, the RV1001AE is one of Shark&#39;s higher-end robo-vacs with powerful suction and a self-cleaning brush roll. The latter ensures that hair won&#39;t get tangled in the brush, making this vacuum a good pick for pet owners. In addition to Shark&#39;s IQ navigation, it also maps out your home as it cleans so you can tell it to only clean the living room or the kitchen by using the mobile app. And if you don&#39;t want to bother with manual cleanings, you can set a schedule in the mobile app, too, and let the robot do all the work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This robot vacuum also cleans itself — it&#39;ll automatically empty its bin into the clean base that comes with it. Yes, you&#39;ll have to empty the base once every month or so, but that&#39;s much more convenient than having to remember to dump out the robot&#39;s contents every time. Also, Shark&#39;s clean base is bagless, so you don&#39;t have to buy proprietary liners like you do with other robots that come with similar bases.</p><p>If you can live without the clean base, a few other <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark vacuums" href="https://amzn.to/3vWWPh5">Shark vacuums</a> — both robot and not — are on sale right now, too. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ AV970" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK">Shark IQ AV970</a>, which is down to $250. That&#39;s $150 off its normal price and close to its all-time low of $230. It has many of the same features as the RV1001AE, including a self-cleaning brush roll, IQ navigation and Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Aside from the clean base, you&#39;ll have to forgo home mapping with this model, but you&#39;ll get an extra-large dust bin, which allows the robot to suck up more dirt and debris before you need to empty it.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK" id="48ede0ab78f840b4a37e423b3a503408" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ AV970 at Amazon - $250</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-is-nearly-half-off-today-133007846.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdeb78bd-041e-4ff6-b4e3-bce586036334</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635425424</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T12:50:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[McDonald's and IBM could bring AI-powered drive-thrus to more restaurants]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McDonald&#39;s might not be the only restaurant experimenting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-mcdonald-plans-to-bring-ai-voice-technology-to-its-drive-thrus.html">AI-based order taking</a> in the near future. <em>Restaurant Dive</em><a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/mcdonalds-will-sell-mcd-tech-labs-to-ibm/608978/">reports</a> McDonald&#39;s is <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.IBM-McD-Tech-Labs.html">selling</a> its McD Tech Labs to IBM in order to &quot;further accelerate&quot; work on its automated voice ordering systems.

It&#39;s <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_mirrorless_01.htm">Nikon&#39;s first camera</a> to use a stacked sensor with built in memory that allows for very fast readout speeds. In fact, Nikon is so confident in the electronic shutter that it has abandoned the mechanical shutter entirely, so the Z9 is the first high-end professional camera without one.</p><p>With that high-speed sensor (which has the same megapixel count as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z7-ii-review-140054141.html">Z7 II</a>), the Z9 allows a flash sync of up to 1/200th of a second, which looks like the fastest sync speed ever for an electronic shutter. That should also make it very resistant to rolling shutter, which is crucial if the camera is to be used for sports or action photography.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The faster sensor allows JPEG burst shooting at up to 30 fps, or RAW photos at 20 fps. If you&#39;re willing to drop down to 11 megapixels, you can shoot photos at an astounding 120 fps. As with other stacked sensor cameras, the Nikon Z has much improved buffering, letting you capture up to 1,000 frames at once with either JPEG or the new HE (high efficiency) RAW compression algorithms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9041d3a0-37ee-11ec-9d7f-3ffb91bd348b" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="60437871-cff7-3b83-971e-066ba17897fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Nikon&#39;s autofocus (AF) system is also all-new, and makes even more extensive use of AI algorithms. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-24-megapixel-eos-r-3-can-shoot-raw-photos-at-30-fps-100003365.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R3</a>, it can now track a wide range of subjects, including the eyes, faces and bodies of people, along with dogs, cats and birds, planes, trains, motorbike and bicycles. And unlike other AI cameras, there&#39;s no need to tell it what you&#39;re shooting — the camera will figure that out if you set it to &quot;Auto&quot; (or, you can set the subject type manually). It also offers a &quot;3D tracking&quot; system much like you can find on Nikon&#39;s DSLRs. All of this falls into line with the Z9&#39;s purpose as a sports/action/wildlife photography camera.</p><p>Nikon has also improved its in-body stabilization system (which it calls &quot;vibration reduction&quot; or VR). Now, it can combine in-body and lens stabilization system for steadier video or fewer blurry photos. This will only be available with several lenses to begin with, however, namely the Nikkor Z 70-200m F/2.8, Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR and freshly announced Z 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 VR S.&nbsp;</p><p>Video performance is equally impressive, as Nikon teased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-z-9-with-8-k-video-capability-is-set-to-arrive-later-this-year-080539577.html">earlier this year</a>. The Z3 will be able to capture 8K at 30p at launch, along with oversampled 4K 30p from an 8K capture that should be incredibly sharp. If you don&#39;t mind pixel binning or line skipping, it will also be able to capture 4K at up to 120 fps.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="77040aec-9604-4f9c-8a84-61170e1f15d3"/><p>To start with, you&#39;ll be able to capture these formats at up to 10-bit with H.264 or H.265 long GOP codecs. On top of that, Nikon is offering the very useful option of capturing video with ProRes 422 HQ compression, which is much easier to edit straight out of the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Things will get even more interesting later on, though. Nikon plans to introduce a future firmware update that will enable 12-bit 8K 60fps capture in a new, proprietary N-RAW format or using Apple ProRes RAW HQ capture at 4K/60p. Nikon promises that you&#39;ll be able to capture the oversampled 4K/30p for more than two hours at &quot;normal&quot; temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z9 has a large pro-style body with controls about where you&#39;d expect them, other than a repositioned play button and AF button near the front. It uses dual CFexpress Type B slots (backward compatible with XQD) for maximum performance for video and burst photos. The new large, EN-EL18d battery is rated for up to 740 shots per charge with the LCD, or 700 shots with the EVF enabled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/31f75680-37ee-11ec-bbf2-6c1cd8c748a7" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="03854cbc-249c-311d-8db3-a17e8f5a5f10"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>It has a 3.69 million dot OLED viewfinder with just a 60 fps refresh rate, but Nikon said that it always delivers that speed and never downgrades it no matter what you&#39;re doing. It uses a multi-direction rear LCD and not a fully-articulating screen, but you can tilt t he screen up to face yourself.</p><p>With the Z9, Nikon has taken some of the best aspects of Canon&#39;s EOS R3 and the Sony A1 and married them into a single, large body. It falls a bit short of those models in terms of shooting speed, and the electronic viewfinder isn&#39;t too impressive on paper. However, Nikon seems to have vaulted ahead of both Sony and Canon in terms of video specs, particularly when the firmware update arrives — though we&#39;ll have to wait and see if video autofocus is up to snuff. The Nikon Z9 will arrive by the end of the year in the US at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$5,500" href="https://fave.co/3Eol6j9">$5,500</a> for the body only.&nbsp;</p><div id="2691fcb5a5d94a54957eaabab3572fce"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzGxEJisrxw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Along with the camera, Nikon also launched two new apps, <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_software_03.htm">NX MobileAir and NX Tether</a>. NX MobileAir allows photographers to transmit images to a smartphone at high speeds via USB cable, then upload them over 5G. It also supports image-editing functions like trimming and IPTC metadata editing. The NX Tether app, meanwhile, allows for tethered studio shooting so photos to be tweaked immediately after shooting.</p><p>Nikon also <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_lens_02.htm">announced</a> a pair of zoom lenses, the Nikkor Z 24-120mm F/4 S and Nikkor Z 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 models ($1,100 and $2,700 respectively), along with the FTZ II FX lens adapter. In addition, the company updated its Z <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_lens_04.htm">lens roadmap</a> with a 400mm f/2.8 TC VR model and, down the road, 600mm and 800mm models. There&#39;s no word yet on when those will arrive.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nikon-officially-unveils-the-45-megapixel-z-9-with-8-k-video-and-20-fps-burst-speeds-125237569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ca215fb-7b49-411e-980b-c871f176bf6a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:52:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635432396</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T14:46:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5aa173f0-37ed-11ec-bb6a-878deca41d53" width="2000" height="1117" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5aa173f0-37ed-11ec-bb6a-878deca41d53" width="2000" height="1117" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Android 12L is Google's latest tablet effort]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google hasn’t given up on Android tablets.

I’m (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-the-new-i-pad-reviewed-111604927.html">half</a>) joking, but bigger-screened Android devices have felt like an afterthought for a while, as iPads or Windows-powered hybrids cleaned up at the high-end, and cheap devices for families and workplaces offered a mostly smartphone experience with more screen real estate.</p><p>Enter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html">Android 12L. </a>It’s designed for bigger screens, including foldables and even laptops. It boils down to a set of new features for the existing OS that are optimized for big screens. While Android can handle a (sort of) multi-window experience, parts of the interface still end up feeling like a blown-up version of a phone OS, rather than something that makes better use of the increased space. One of the things coming to Android 12L is a two-column layout for the notification shade and lockscreen when the system detects that the screen is above 600dps wide.

And maybe, just maybe, it&#39;ll be able to steal the spotlight back from AMD and Apple.</p><p>Intel says 12th-gen chips are up to 19 percent faster than 11th-gen overall, and they&#39;re twice as fast in the Adobe After Effects Pulse benchmark. When it comes to multithreaded performance (tasks built specifically for more than one core, like video and 3D rendering), the company claims the top-end i9-12900K is 50 percent faster than last year&#39;s comparable chip from Intel while using less power. Better still, it can achieve performance parity using only around a quarter of the power. Basically, everyone who held off on upgrading over the last few years could be in for a treat.</p><p>The new hybrid core design will make Intel’s new chips look similar to AMD’s big.LITTLE technology found on smartphone CPUs, combining energy-efficient cores for lightweight tasks with heavy-lifting (but more energy-hungry) cores.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-core-cpu-hybrid-alder-lake-160014440.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">How to use SharePlay on iOS 15.1</a></h2><h3>Apple&#39;s built a lot of tools into its new FaceTime feature.</h3><h3></h3><p>iOS 15.1 was released yesterday, which means you can finally start checking out Apple&#39;s long-awaited SharePlay feature.

Its latest software update <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/">includes</a> a feature called Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, which will allow owners to remotely view their car&#39;s surroundings when parked. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-teslas-sentry-mode-has-already-caught-a-suspected-carjacker.html">Sentry Mode</a> is Tesla&#39;s integrated surveillance system that uses a 360 dash cam to record damage and any attempted break-in. It has resulted to arrests of people who attempted to steal Teslas in the past, but owners haven&#39;t been able to use it to view their car&#39;s current surroundings until now.</p><p>In its update notes, Tesla says the live camera function is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by the company. To enable or disable it, owners need to go under Safety &amp; Security in Controls. According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, however, owners must have an active <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-07-tesla-starts-charging-for-premium-connectivity.html">Premium Connectivity</a> subscription to activate live view. The subscription package gives them access to satellite maps and live traffic visualizations, as well as media streaming and web browsing on data. It does cost $10 a month, but owners can sign up for free trial before paying for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At this point in time, live camera is only available to iOS users who can view the footage around their cars via Tesla&#39;s app. The automaker has unfortunately yet to announce when its Android app will also get the capability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sentry-mode-live-view-091026473.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb29c7a7-e2d4-4aed-ab5c-28eaa3390aec</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 09:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635408644</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T08:10:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[winhorse via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hong Kong - August 13, 2021 : People walk past the Tesla official showroom in Queens Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Showroom in Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 sales remain relatively steady and strong, despite widespread supply shortages, with 3.3 million units sold in fiscal Q2 compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-ps5-10-million-sold-144729654.html">2.2 million last quarter</a>. That brought total sales up to 13.4 million units, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html">announced</a>. Game sales were also up significantly at 76.4 million units compared to 63.6 million in the previous quarter, due in large part to third-party sales.</p><p>All told, this amounted to a healthy 27 percent boost in gaming revenue to 645.4 billion yen ($5.68 billion). However, operating income of 82.7 billion yen ($728 million) was down compared to last quarter by 3.4 billion yen ($29 million). Sony&#39;s fiscal year ends on March 31, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how can profit be lower when sales and revenue are up? While Sony did sell more games last quarter, first-party titles dropped very significantly, from 10.5 million last quarter to 7.6 million in Q2. That was offset in numbers by third-party games, but those don&#39;t tend to be as profitable. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html">Sony</a> have acquired gaming studios to boost their Xbox/PS first-party titles, but Microsoft has been more prolific in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p>And while PS5 sales were up, PS4 units dropped considerably, down to just 200,000 from a half a million the quarter before. Other factors that Sony mentioned are a &quot;loss resulting from strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than manufacturing costs.&quot; That means that Sony may have sold the PS5 with minimal or negative profits this quarter as it attempted to navigate around chip shortages. However, in August, the company said it was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ps5-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss">no longer</a> selling the PS5 at a loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the drop in quarterly income, Sony&#39;s gaming division appears to be on pretty solid footing. In its August earnings call, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki told investors that its PS5 sales target is set higher than the 14.8 million unit sales achieved by the PlayStation 4 in its first year. Based on today&#39;s figures, PS5 sales are closely tracking that trajectory.</p><p>The company also said at the time that it had secured enough components for 22.6 million units sold by March 2022. That would be enough to meet its sales projections, but if sales really explode during the holidays, it may not have a lot of margin for error — meaning shortages could continue through next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bab9ba0-b9da-4144-a72f-827bbb38dd55</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 08:41:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635420718</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T11:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Prodigy’ centers technology by focusing on those who don’t have it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains moderate spoilers for the first episode and slight spoilers for episode two of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Prodigy" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/n12OYa"><em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>How do you make a series that can draw in newcomers while still appealing to long-time fans? In the case of <em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>, you set it in a place where the United Federation of Planets has little to no presence — the Delta Quadrant — and make your cast a bunch of misfit kids who have never heard of the Federation or Starfleet. That puts them on the same level as the children this show hopes to draw in, while offering up just enough tidbits to intrigue their Trekkie parents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1c31ae1e21af4b5c8b4e1f37907ddd94"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBE7d8sH5Rg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The pilot, ‘Lost and Found,’ is a feature-length episode that debuted today on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> (that means it’s technically two parts). It was originally planned to air on Nickelodeon first, but it was changed to a streaming-exclusive for 2021 with the cable channel airing it later at a still-unknown date. The animated show fills in the content gap between the end of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> earlier this month and the premiere of <a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/EaZn7n"><em>Discovery</em></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-november-18-paramount-plus-014439729.html">season four</a> in November — which in turn, should carry fans through to the start of season two of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Picard" href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html"><em>Picard</em></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-paramount-plus-2022-034119473.html">in February</a>. The idea is to keep Star Trek fans from dropping their subscriptions to Paramount+ during the downtime, something that was fairly common during <em>Discovery</em>’s first three seasons.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef1a9730-3763-11ec-b5fe-7dc4933d8c37" style="height:1202;width:2910;" alt="Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

And that’s where the deeper ties to Trek lore come in. Though Voyager spent seven years in the Delta Quadrant, the ship’s mission to get back to Federation space meant it couldn’t stick around in any one place too long, or return to previous locales. There’s a ton left to explore — as well as plenty of room for Prodigy’s creators, Dan and Kevin Hageman, to populate their own corner of the universe.</p><p>First, they have to introduce their main characters, and that’s what ‘Lost and Found’ is largely dedicated to doing. Our cast of misfits, led by Dal (voiced by Brett Gray), lives on a mining colony populated by prisoners and orphans. It’s the last place anyone would want to be, especially a Star Trek character, which is why the main drive is to just get off this bleak rock. But right away the series makes its point about being far from Federation space and technology, as the inhabitants can’t even talk to each other due to a lack of universal translators. That system has been how, for over 55 years, Star Trek has managed to populate its cast with aliens who all speak English. It’s the future! Different languages aren’t a problem!</p><div id="6ded429095d343f49f76765bc22e338f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-1VLAt_UjU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Except here, they are. It keeps the characters from even knowing each other’s names, which makes the discovery of the <em>USS Protostar</em> and its built-in translator the perfect opportunity for everyone to re-introduce themselves to each other and thus, to the audience. And, when Dal and Rocktok discover a lost Starfleet ship buried under the surface of the planet, the ship itself may fill them with awe, but it’s the translator that truly elicits the most enthusiastic reaction: Rocktok calls it “magic.” It’s a rather fitting introduction to a franchise with a goal to “seek out new life and new civilizations,” in how it puts the connection between these disparate aliens up front.</p><p>When I saw the pilot at New York Comic Con <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-look-183049340.html">a few weeks ago</a>, I compared it to shows like <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em>. The Star Wars influence that J.J. Abrams brought to the Star Trek franchise is still present in <em>Prodigy</em>, notably in its action sequences and score, the latter composed by frequent Michael Giacchino collaborator Nami Melumad. Giacchino is best known for his work on various Pixar and Star Trek films, and he also supplies the main theme for <em>Prodigy</em>. You can hear his influence on Melumad’s score, which does a great job of blending a quirky style with the signature Trek leitmotifs.</p><div id="5654405eac214090b0555ebfac963ae8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bm9Zv8D70hA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The final action sequence feels like pure Star Wars, as the <em>USS Protostar</em> makes its way off the planet and Dal is trapped on its hull, battling the villainous Drednok. The bad guy’s insect-like cyborg body reminds me of General Grievous — if the general could turn into a giant gun, that is. It’s the kind of thing that works best in CG and, like <em>Lower Decks</em> before it, <em>Prodigy</em> seems more than willing to embrace the extra freedom offered by animation as a medium. We’re long past the clunky microfiche displays and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_non-humanoids_(23rd_century)#Alfa_177_canine">cosplaying dogs</a> of the original series.</p><p>That freedom is probably best illustrated in the character of hologram Captain Janeway, voiced by Kate Mulgrew (of course). It’s been over 20 years since <em>Voyager</em> last graced the small screen, and Mulgrew has kept busy on shows like <em>Warehouse 13</em> and <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. But in the Star Trek universe, it’s only been six years (though an exact date is never given on-screen in <em>Prodigy</em>). Animation means they can easily erase the decades from Janeway without resorting to the creepy live-action simulacrums seen in <em>Rogue One</em> of Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.</p><div id="75b15dc6009244ccb45c9541f1791597"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp2MfWFF2Wk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Hologram Janeway makes her debut at the end of today’s pilot episode, but she’ll make a much fuller appearance in next week’s ‘Starstruck.’ That’s where the new “cadets” get to explore the ship and learn more about the distant “Federation.” While there’s still plenty of banter and conflict between the characters, the real star of the second episode is the ship itself — what it looks like, and what it’s capable of. While there is a plot — which I won’t divulge details of — it serves as a showcase for all the different features of this new prototype ship. You can almost imagine Janeway as a car salesman, slapping the hood of the <em>Protostar</em> and saying “this baby’s warp core can travel to so many planets.”</p><p>Star Trek has always been a humanist franchise, devoted to exploring social themes and dilemmas. It also has a tendency to take its technology and the “post-scarcity utopia” for granted. <em>Prodigy</em> goes against the grain by showing from the start how technology can change lives.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-episode-lost-and-found-070033462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28afb0c2-e566-46b9-b5b0-81b41cc36261</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635367336</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T20:42:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .
