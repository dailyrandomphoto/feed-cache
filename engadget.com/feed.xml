While we likely won&#39;t see the deep discounts we saw in November and December for some time, the deals that are currently available are noteworthy for this time of year. A number of Google smart devices are on sale, including the second-generation Nest Hub for $60 and the Nest Audio for $75. Apple&#39;s Mac Mini M1 is as low as $600 for the base model, while the iPad Air is $60 off. Here are the best tech deals from this week that you can still get today.</p><h2>Mac Mini M1</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" style="height:1069;width:1600;" alt="Apple Mac mini" data-uuid="fb4e7c46-569e-4488-afa8-27945091b6d6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The base <a href="https://amzn.to/3JFEqMj">Mac Mini M1</a> is $100 off thanks to a sale and an additional coupon, bringing it down to $600. This model runs on the M1 chipset along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. This is Apple&#39;s most affordable M1 machine, making it a good option if you&#39;re in need of an upgraded desktop. If you&#39;d rather invest in a more powerful version, Adorama has the <a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/9W9Gx0">Mac Mini M1 with 16GB of RAM</a> and 256GB of storage for $750, or $150 less than usual.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3JFEqMj" id="1283fd93d85a4cd29e84c15166dcf738" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 at Amazon - $600</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/9W9Gx0" id="7865045073944fbb8b15a9d6d70ac1cd" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini Mi1 (16GB) at Adorama - $750</a><h2>iPad Air</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/234da310-6fbf-11ec-afde-991c2c47b02e" style="height:1350;width:1800;" alt="2020 Apple iPad Air" data-uuid="eca69911-e76c-3c51-89d4-30ea821574ed"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2020 iPad Air" href="https://amzn.to/3EU8zny">2020 iPad Air</a> is on sale for $539 right now, or $60 off its normal price.

The first three episodes that drop on Monday are based on London, Brooklyn and Miami Beach. A new episode will debut each week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rather than celebrity guests, familiar Fitness+ trainers will lead Time to Run sessions. On your Apple Watch, you&#39;ll be able to see photos taken by the trainer along their route. You can view these images in the workout summary and save them to your photo library. For those who use a wheelchair, the feature will be renamed Time to Run or Push, and they&#39;ll be able to select either a run or an Outdoor Push Running Pace workout.</p><p>Apple told Engadget that Time to Run episodes each last around 30 or 60 minutes, which is longer than the typical Time to Walk runtime of 25 to 40 minutes. Other fitness apps offer audio-guided running features, such as Aaptiv, Nike+Run Club and Runtastic. Apple isn&#39;t exactly breaking new ground here, but Fitness+ users will have another option for working up a sweat.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8538d9b0-6fd7-11ec-ad77-f04a0af04d76" style="height:1400;width:1960;" alt="Apple Fitness+ Collections displayed on an iPad." data-uuid="d35f57d0-9d7d-37a0-87f2-21f257e154ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Also on January 10th, Apple will roll out Collections. It&#39;s a curated series of workouts and guided meditations pulled from the Fitness+ library. The feature will suggest plans to help folks make intentional training choices in the following days and weeks. Six Collections will be available at the outset, including Run Your First 5K, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses and Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.</p><p>On the same day, the third season of Time to Walk will premiere. The latest batch of guests include Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Chris Meloni and Hasan Minhaj. Episodes will be added on a weekly basis.

It’s the maker of the highly sought-after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-19-at-home-rapid-serial-testing-074232925.html">BinaxNOW rapid COVID-19 tests</a>. It’s also behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-28-fda-freestyle-libre-flash.html"><ins>Freestyle Livre</ins></a>, one of the more popular continuous glucose monitors that negates the need for finger stick blood testing.</p><p>The upcoming biowearables, which aren&#39;t intended for medical use, build on the sensing tech Abbott developed for Freestyle Livre. Athletes are using a version of the device to help optimize their food intake for their training and competition. With Lingo, the company is planning to expand glucose monitoring use cases to help the public manage things like sleep, weight and energy levels.</p><p>The aim of the ketone biowearable is to offer continuous tracking of ketones so that wearers can see how quickly they get into ketosis. That&#39;s a state in which a body doesn&#39;t have enough carbohydrates to turn into energy and instead burns fat (and generates ketones). With the lactate wearable, Abbott&#39;s goal is to continuously measure lactate build up while working out. It says that can provide insights on athletic performance.</p><p>It&#39;ll be some time before Abbott can bring this tech to the consumer market.

While he&#39;s no longer with us, his contribution to our understanding of the universe remains immense and shouldn&#39;t be forgotten. To pay tribute to the celebrated physicist and cosmologist on what would&#39;ve been his 80th birthday, Google worked with his family to create a video Doodle that gives us a condensed version of his life. Moreover, the tech giant used Hawking&#39;s famous computer-generated voice to narrate his work and experiences from the time he graduated.&nbsp;</p><p>Hawking was born in 1942 in Oxford, England and has always been fascinated with the universe. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease, when he was 21. In the years after that, he lost his mobility and his ability to speak, but he was able to communicate through a computer using a voice created in the 1980s by MIT engineer Dennis Klatt. In the Doodle, you&#39;ll hear Hawking&#39;s voice talk about his work on black holes — one of the scientific works he&#39;s most known for is the Hawking radiation, which is the theory that black holes emit radiation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll also hear his voice say how he&#39;s free in his mind even though he cannot move. &quot;I have spent my life traveling across the universe inside my mind,&quot; his voice narrates.</p><p>In a statement, his daughter Lucy and sons, Robert and Tim Hawking, said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We also believe he would have found it important to show that he never allowed the challenges of his physical condition to limit his power of expression nor his determination to make an impact on the world in which he lived. We hope that his example offers inspiration and hope globally to all who face great challenges at this difficult time. Our father would have been 80 years old today and we thank everyone who has joined in the celebration of his extraordinary life and the legacy he gave to us all.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can watch the whole Doodle below.</p><div id="689c3833f8b540bea6673eb51462f31e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Isim0ysZ6X4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-doodle-pays-tribute-stephen-hawking-134549358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a409cc0b-68ea-4dab-bc0b-f9697ce9774a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 13:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641561654</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T13:21:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2681b40-6fb5-11ec-ab6f-2dc3199a4641" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2681b40-6fb5-11ec-ab6f-2dc3199a4641" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Everything we loved (and hated) at CES 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of the year again!

As a result, Bitcoin <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/jwz/status/1478022085737803776">uses more energy</a> than many countries, and much of that comes from dirty sources like coal.&nbsp;</p><p>Last year Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-soon-let-you-buy-one-of-its-e-vs-with-bitcoin-082916783.html">announced</a> that it would accept Bitcoin payment for its EVs, and even bought up $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin to smooth the process. However, many folks pointed out that the environmental benefits of an EV could heavily reduced by the <a href="https://ccaf.io/cbeci/index">staggering amount</a> of electricity required to mine a single Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>Mozilla said it will continue to explore the cryptocurrency donation idea but keep folks in the loop this time. &quot;In the spirit of open-source, this will be a transparent process and we&#39;ll share regular updates,&quot; the Foundation tweeted. &quot;We look forward to having this conversation and appreciate our community for bringing this to our attention.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-stops-accepting-crypto-donations-following-outrage-over-climate-impact-131619769.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">182d81e0-b538-41e2-bd85-6bb7b0872a91</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 13:16:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641561379</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T13:16:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/7af195f0-5511-11eb-bfdf-e1a99276509e" width="5028" height="3352" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/7af195f0-5511-11eb-bfdf-e1a99276509e" width="5028" height="3352" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[August 21, 2019 San Francisco / CA / USA - Mozilla office building, displaying the Firefox logo and symbol and the stylized company name ( moz://a ); Mozilla is a free software community]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mozilla office building in San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Smart beds that adapt as you age]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As CES wraps up, we’re still pulling together our favorite picks of the show.

The company is holding back from revealing absolutely everything (well, most things), but that hasn&#39;t stopped <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-10-pro-leak-reveals-all-of-the-phones-key-specs">leaks and rumors </a>of a 6.7-inch display with high refresh rates, and the very latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It followed up Tuesday evening with a barrage of specs. They include a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED with LTPO screen, which means the phone can adjust its refresh rates to improve battery life. There are no specifics on screen size, but the rumors suggest it’ll be a pretty large 6.7-inch display. OnePlus will include 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging in its new flagship, which should be suitably speedy when the 5,000mAh battery needs charging.<br><br>The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, running Android 12 with OnePlus’ OxygenOS tricks and aesthetics. When it comes to cameras, expect 48- and 50-megapixel sensors with an additional 8MP sensor too. Optical zoom capabilities? We don’t know just yet, but the camera array will include dual optical image stabilization, which should help with crisper images, less noise and better performance in low light. That said, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera performance was one of the weaker points on an otherwise impressive smartphone. <br><br>Hopefully, the 10 Pro can right that wrong. OnePlus has outlined some of the upgrades it’s making to the Hasselblad-branded camera, including a new RAW+ shooting mode that attempts to combine the editing range of RAW format images with computational photography, which should result in increased dynamic range and noise reduction.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58a43a40-6f99-11ec-9fa7-5bd1c621cd45" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="f0e70253-539b-3d7d-b242-77167c16b624"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>The phone also has a new 150-degree ultra-wide camera, with a new fisheye mode. If you’re fearing stretched faces in group shots, don’t worry: there’s a “more traditional” 110-degree FOV that’ll include distortion correction for those outer edges of a shot.&nbsp;</p><p>OnePlus says its new “Billion Color Solution” means photos on the 10 Pro have 25 percent expanded DCI-P3 color gamut covered, and the phone can process 64 times more color than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It says this will remove any hint of color banding from shots.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588392e0-6f99-11ec-bffd-ce4c25d94bf3" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="24d9b170-79a7-3ee5-beb1-bbf3b7fbc02f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>On top of that, each camera on the OnePlus 10 Pro can capture photos in 12-bit RAW, using what Hasselblad calls Natural Color Solution.  The phone also has a new RAW+ format that should allow you to edit to your heart’s content while still benefiting from computational photography assistance. OnePlus has offered a few samples, but it’s something we’ll have a better grasp of when we eventually get to test out the new flagship later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The big challenge could be balancing price, specs and features so that it offers enough go up against the high-end phones of Apple and Samsung.

So far, there are no details on the plot or who might star in the series.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fallout-moving-forward-as-a-tv-series-on-amazon-prime-092535878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87e8a97a-2fc4-4790-bb95-8b009f643181</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 09:25:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641543526</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T08:18:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Venture Capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b5de20d0-6f90-11ec-bb3d-4295a8315f9d" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b5de20d0-6f90-11ec-bb3d-4295a8315f9d" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bethesda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's 'Fallout' series set to start production this year]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's 'Fallout' series set to start production this year]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[OrCam's MyEye Pro clips to glasses to help visually impaired people read and identify faces]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OrCam, a company that makes products to aid accessibility for the visually impaired, has won a <a href="https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2022/Honorees/O/OrCam-MyEye-PRO.aspx">CES innovation award</a> for its glasses-mounted <a href="https://www.orcam.com/en/myeye2/">MyEye Pro device</a>.

It issued its initial decision back in August, and this finalizes its ruling, which prohibits Google from importing products found to have violated Sonos&#39; intellectual properties. Since Google manufactures its products in China, that means it won&#39;t be able to gets them shipped to the US when the import ban takes effect in 60 days.</p><p>Sonos sued Google in 2020 over five patents, which include one that details a technology allowing wireless speakers to sync with one another. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/technology/google-sonos-patents.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, the products affected include Google&#39;s Home smart speakers, Pixel phones and computers, as well as Chromecast devices. While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn&#39;t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;While we disagree with today&#39;s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,&quot; the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-violated-sonos-patents"><em>Protocol</em></a>. &quot;We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos&#39; frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.&quot; The commission didn&#39;t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the Nest team has recently <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811">announced</a> some changes to speaker groups, which it says is &quot;due to a recent legal ruling.&quot; The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They&#39;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p><p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#39;s a possibility that &quot;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&quot; However, he said the tech giant&#39;s products will still &quot;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&quot; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>His whole statement reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#39; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-regulator-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents-062437906.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee6604f1-b339-44b6-a410-8065f42e68c1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 06:24:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641536678</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T06:24:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta sued for alleged role in extremist-linked murder of federal guard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The surviving sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal security guard who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2020, has filed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21174499-underwood-v-meta-complaint">a lawsuit</a> against Meta, the parent organization of Facebook.

The company has now <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-home-hub-helps-manage-chores-from-one-central-device">shared</a> more information about it. At launch, the Home Hub will have the ability to connect to every product in the SmartThings ecosystem, including Samsung appliances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f915a0-6f13-11ec-bbfe-69c99639675c" alt="Samsung Home Hub" data-uuid="fe137466-8a06-317c-ba9f-8d902ccf4843"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>In that way, it can tell you how much power your appliances use and if one needs cleaning. Home cooks will find a recipe hub for creating shopping lists and meal plans. Those are just some of the use cases Samsung outlines for the Home Hub. The company says the device’s AI software will anticipate what you need and put that information in front of you exactly when you need it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung has also pledged to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html">Matter standard</a>, which should open the door for the hub to connect to devices from other manufacturers. Based on the photos shared by Samsung, the Home Hub runs Android, suggesting it may also be possible to use it as a standard tablet. The device also comes with two speakers and two microphones, as well as the company’s Bixby assistant. The tablet will come with the charging dock you see pictured in the photos, and you’re free to take it out of that stand.</p><p>At first glance, it’s hard to see the appeal of the Home Hub. After all, it’s essentially a tablet that comes with the company’s SmartThings app preinstalled. You can download that same software on your phone. So it’s not like it’s offering something that isn’t already out there. However, framed another way, it’s a different approach to a smart display. Samsung hasn’t tried to create a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html">Echo Show 15</a> that wants to be the center of your home. The focus here is narrow, and that’s something that could appeal to people.</p><p>Samsung will release the Home Hub in Korea sometime in March, with global availability to follow later. No word yet on US pricing.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-home-hub-ces-2022-221133090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c569a334-73b3-4265-bd5c-6843c0adebc4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:11:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641507095</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T03:42:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[E3 will be online-only again this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the third straight year, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/e3/">E3</a>.

In a complaint spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870120/snap-suing-trademark-word-spectacles-smart-glasses-snapchat"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, Snap claims its usage of the term “evokes an incongruity between an 18th-century term for corrective eyewear and Snap’s high-tech 21st-century smart glasses.”</p><p>The complaint stems from an ongoing disagreement between Snap and the USPTO over whether “spectacles” is a term that can be applied to any pair of smart glasses. In an <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149580/ttabvue_87177292_EXA_13.pdf"><ins>opinion</ins></a> the agency’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board published in November, the USPTO said Snap’s use of Spectacles had failed to acquire the “distinctiveness” necessary for a trademark. “Spectacles is so commonly used to describe the nature of the product or competing products, rather than any particular source of the product(s),” the USPTO said at the time. In suing the USPTO, Snap hopes to overturn the appeal board’s decision.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snap first filed for a Spectacles trademark in 2016, the same year it released the first-generation model. Despite a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-17-snapchat-spectacle-fan-driven-launch.html"><ins>clever marketing campaign</ins></a> involving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-10-snapchat-spectacles-snapbot-vending-machine.html"><ins>Minion-like vending machines</ins></a>, the wearable was a bust for the company. At one point, Snap reportedly had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-23-unsold-snapchat-spectacles.html"><ins>thousands of unsold pairs</ins></a> collecting dust in Chinese warehouses. However, even after losing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-02-snap-may-release-two-new-pairs-of-spectacles-soon.html"><ins>$40 million</ins></a> on the first version, it went on to release two new models and recently debuted a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html"><ins>augmented reality Spectacles</ins></a>.</p><p>To that end, Snap claims, thanks to social media marketing, word of mouth and media coverage, consumers have come to associate the word “spectacles” with its brand, a claim the USPTO disputes. In the same November opinion, the agency wrote Spectacles’ “social media accounts have an underwhelming number of followers, and the number of followers is surprisingly small.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snap-sues-us-patent-office-spectacles-trademark-190518221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dad25044-f99f-49f3-b735-24e6a19a2583</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 19:05:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641495450</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T18:57:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/abe54ad0-9189-11eb-b3bb-6494623c4d14" width="1600" height="1070" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/abe54ad0-9189-11eb-b3bb-6494623c4d14" width="1600" height="1070" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snap Spectacles 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Snap Spectacles 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The first edition of the Chevy Silverado EV sold out in 12 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soon after GM formally revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html"><ins>Chevrolet Silverado EV</ins></a> at CES, it emerged that the $105,000 RST First Edition has already sold out.

Other major tech companies created their own versions of live audio rooms, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-audio-content-hub-live-audio-rooms-podcasts-170633543.html">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter%20spaces/">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-discovery-portal-170039853.html">Discord</a>. LinkedIn might be slightly late to the party, but its take on the format might prove a success in the long run, with many of its users eager to learn from those who are willing to share their knowledge, experience and insights.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/linkedin-events-audio-video-clubhouse-181215696.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d29d3a55-4abd-4eee-8e57-eac96c0e8657</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:12:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641504027</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T21:20:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/2a6a6900-7d29-11eb-bcfd-b281875d0d54" width="4400" height="2933" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/2a6a6900-7d29-11eb-bcfd-b281875d0d54" width="4400" height="2933" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nov 17, 2019 San Francisco / CA / USA - LinkedIn headquarters in SoMa district; LinkedIn is an American business and employment-oriented service owned by Microsoft]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LinkedIn headquarters in downtown San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VW will reveal its production ID.Buzz microbus EV on March 9th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to wait much longer to see an honest-to-goodness production version of Volkswagen&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-electric-microbus-release-date-us-europe-id-buzz-173557828.html">ID.Buzz minivan</a>. VW Group chief Herbert Diess has <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041">announced</a> that his company will debut the reincarnated microbus on March 9th. He didn&#39;t share more beyond a sketch, but VW&#39;s testing of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-buzz-electric-minivan-arrives-as-a-self-driving-prototype-125030104.html">self-driving prototype</a> suggests the finished van won&#39;t lose many of the design cues from the nostalgia-inspired concept.</p><p>The ID.Buzz is expected to launch in Europe later in 2022, and reach American shores in 2023. You&#39;ll have to &#39;settle&#39; for the passenger-focused long-wheelbase model in the US where Europeans will get short-wheelbase and commercial models. Europe is also more likely to get a self-driving variant, too. Entry models could start with rear wheel drive models that offer up to 200HP, while the range-topper could include AWD and 300HP. You may see up to three battery capacities.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Buzz might not be as mass market-friendly as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">the ID.4</a> and other more conventional models, but it could still be one of VW&#39;s most important EVs. Like the Beetle, VW&#39;s microbus design remains iconic. The Buzz could serve as a halo vehicle whose cachet attracts buyers to the brand&#39;s overall EV lineup, even if they ultimately settle for another model.</p><div id="accbe979b16046bda66c89488754fe55"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The legend returns on 03/09/22! <a href="https://t.co/Q4hFyCN5mr">pic.twitter.com/Q4hFyCN5mr</a></p>— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vw-id-buzz-microbus-reveal-date-173402540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dac16427-38a6-41e7-9c24-6577fd351376</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:34:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641489969</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T17:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New York Times is buying subscription-based sports site The Athletic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-the-athletic-sports-news-subscription-podcasts.html"><em>The Athletic</em></a>, which quickly came to prominence for publishing <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nwsl-uswnt-players-call-for-investigation-after-coach-paul-riley-accused-of-sexual-coercion-171549998.html">exclusive reporting</a> and high-quality sports journalism, is getting a new owner. As first reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nyt-to-buy-the-athletic-for-550-million"><em>The Information</em></a>, <em>The New York Times</em> has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/business/new-york-times-the-athletic.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes">agreed</a> to buy the subscription-based digital media company for $550 million.

It had 8.3 million subscribers as of September 30th. Along with its digital and print publications, the <em>Times</em> has separate plans for its cooking and games (which includes crosswords) products. It bolstered its offerings in recent years by acquiring <em>Wirecutter</em> and placing the popular product review site behind a paywall.</p><p><em>The Athletic</em> previously said it didn&#39;t expect to turn a profit until next year. It has 1.2 million subscribers, though its growth was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/the-athletic-searches-for-a-buyer-and-many-more-subscribers">reportedly slowing</a> as of November. The <em>Times</em> held talks with the company last summer about a deal, according to reports, but it backed out before returning to the negotiating table last month.</p><p><em>The Athletic</em> has a roster of talented, big-name sportswriters, many of whom it poached from publications across North America and the UK by offering competitive salaries. Back in 2017, co-founder Alex Mather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?_r=0">told <em>The Times</em></a> (oddly enough) that his company &quot;will wait every local paper out and let them continuously bleed until we are the last ones standing” and &quot;suck them dry of their best talent at every moment.&quot; Mather later apologized for those remarks.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6 6:55PM ET: </strong>Added confirmation of the agreement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-athletic-new-york-times-deal-170515634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69d0ab3c-cc49-45f8-8fed-a04f56595e4e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:05:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641513476</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T23:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363e4320-6f11-11ec-b7ff-1e6d1a206c52" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363e4320-6f11-11ec-b7ff-1e6d1a206c52" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[J2R via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York City, USA - August 2, 2018: Facade of The New York Times (NYT and NYTimes) headquarters on Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, USA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The New York Times headquarters in New York City, USA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[David Bowie's later albums have been remixed in 360 Reality Audio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The late <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-11-rip-david-bowie.html">David Bowie&#39;s</a> music is already immersive on many levels, but that&#39;s now reflected in the mixes themselves.  All of Bowie&#39;s post-2000 studio albums (<em>Heathen</em>, <em>Reality</em>, <em>The Next Day</em> and <em>Blackstar</em>) plus a live album (<em>A Reality Tour</em>) have been remixed in Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">360 Reality Audio</a> for release on Amazon Music Unlimited, Deezer and Tidal on January 21st. You can also listen to four of the <em>A Reality Tour</em> songs today (January 6th) at 7PM Eastern through <a href="https://square.sony.com/ces2022/360ra/">Sony Square</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKezF4XDLq4">YouTube</a>, and through the <a href="https://music.artistconnection.net/sharedContent?token=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;studioUuid=faa1b390-624b-4f6a-a703-6e535cb40d90&amp;shareableId=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;mobileOnly=true&amp;studioId=2&amp;url=https:%2F%2Fapi.demo.artistconnection.net">Artist Connection</a> mobile app afterward.</p><p>Importantly, longtime Bowie producer Tony Visconti was responsible for the mixes. This is as close as you&#39;ll get to a Bowie-approved mix in 2022, in other words, and it&#39;s a fitting tribute for the rock legend&#39;s imminent 75th birthday. You can use any headphones to listen in 360 Reality Audio, although Sony would clearly prefer you use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">its products</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This won&#39;t satisfy fans who want 360-degree mixes of full classic albums like <em>Hunky Dory</em> or <em>Low</em> (really, the album with &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; didn&#39;t get a rework?). You likewise won&#39;t be thrilled if you prefer services like Apple Music or Spotify. Only a handful of Bowie songs have received the spatial audio treatment to date, though — this is still a treat for enthusiasts eager for some audio bliss.</p><div id="2d17e6cee5d64db8910dab6cce5e5559"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKezF4XDLq4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/david-bowie-360-degree-audio-mix-164016924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d39cee43-6dde-40b2-9cdd-83e6913ccc0f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:40:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641484706</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T15:58:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shaun Best / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[David Bowie performs his North American debut of "A Reality Tour" in Montreal, December 13, 2003.
