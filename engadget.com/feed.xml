Google <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/accessibility/project-relate">announced today</a> that it&#39;s made a new Android app called Project Relate that could help people with speech impairments communicate more easily with others and the Assistant. It&#39;s <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_9fFSD4IAqHaePFebXMBOUML8rEFyZD4DNxG5LaZhpW5QXQ/viewform">looking for beta testers</a> to test and improve the app starting today.</p><p>Like product manager for Google Research Julie Cattiau said in a video, &quot;standard speech recognition doesn&#39;t always work as well for people with atypical speech because the algorithms have not been trained on samples of their speech.&quot; Project Relate would use custom models trained on each individual user&#39;s speech patterns. When someone first launches the app, it&#39;ll ask them to repeat a few phrases to create a base model and understand the way they speak.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Then, Project Relate can do three things: Transcribe the user&#39;s speech into text that they can copy and paste or show to people on their screen, read out what the user said in a synthesized voice and communicated with the Google Assistant.&nbsp;</p><p>The app is still being tested, with the company saying it will get back applicants for beta testing positions &quot;in the coming months.&quot; But this is an important first step towards improving speech recognition for those with atypical speech.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-project-relate-android-app-speech-impairment-203016526.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83b1c1e4-44ad-4675-b1cf-bd59801ea7d9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 20:30:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636489817</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T20:30:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0a66fa60-419b-11ec-a7fe-ef9345d010c4" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0a66fa60-419b-11ec-a7fe-ef9345d010c4" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the launch screen of Google's Project Relate app in a person's hand.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Project Relate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bipartisan bill seeks to curb recommendation algorithms]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bipartisan group of House lawmakers has introduced legislation that would give people more control over the algorithms that shape their online experience. If passed, the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21100363-buck_030_xml-filter-bubble">Filter Bubble Transparency Act</a> would require companies like Meta to offer a version of their platforms that runs on an &quot;input-transparent&quot; algorithm that doesn&#39;t pull on user data to generate recommendations.</p><p>The bill would not do away with &quot;opaque&quot; recommendation algorithms altogether but would make it a requirement to include a toggle that allows people to switch that functionality off. Additionally, platforms that continue to use recommendation algorithms need to have a notification that informs people those recommendations are based on inferences generated by their personal data. The prompt can be a one-time notice, but it would need to be presented in a &quot;clear, conspicuous manner,&quot; according to the proposed bill.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The legislation was introduced by Representatives Ken Buck (R-CO), David Cicilline (D-RI), Lori Trahan (D-MA) and Burgess Owens (R-UT). It&#39;s a <a href="https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=0CA78D6E-C0A8-4BDB-9AA9-1900238810E5">companion bill</a> to legislation Senators John Thune of South Dakota and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut introduced this past June. &quot;Consumers should have the option to engage with internet platforms without being manipulated by secret algorithms driven by user-specific data,&quot; Buck told <a href="https://www.axios.com/algorithm-bill-house-bipartisan-5293581e-430f-4ea1-8477-bd9adb63519c.html"><em>Axios</em></a>, the first outlet to report on the legislation.</p><p>Lawmakers have frequently criticized social media giants for using recommendation algorithms to boost user engagement, but so far, there&#39;s been little legislative action to curb their use. In the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol attack, a group of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democrats-facebook-twitter-youtube-suggestion-algorithms-194136288.html">30 Democratic lawmakers</a> called on Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">then known as Facebook</a>), Twitter and YouTube to make substantive changes to their recommendation engines but ultimately stopped short of threatening regulatory action. Although the Filter Bubble Transparency Act has bipartisan support across the House and Senate, it&#39;s unclear if it would pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/filter-bubble-transparency-act-house-introduction-200706847.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7fa7672d-296b-44ca-96f8-e0f1f4f04569</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 20:07:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636488557</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T20:09:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9d41fc90-4196-11ec-b7f3-ca9bd74beee4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9d41fc90-4196-11ec-b7f3-ca9bd74beee4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rep.

The new numbers, released with the company’s latest quarterly transparency reports, come as Meta faces increasing scrutiny over its ability to protect users and enforce its policies adequately around the world.</p><p>Its latest report marks the first time the company has shared &quot;prevalence&quot; metrics around <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/how-meta-addresses-bullying-harassment/">bullying and harassment</a> on its platform. &quot;Prevalence&quot; is a statistic Facebook uses to track violating content that slips through its detection systems. &quot;It represents the amount of violating content that people actually view that actually shows up on someone&#39;s screen,&quot; the company&#39;s VP of Integrity Guy Rosen told reporters during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the company, the prevalence of bullying content was between 0.14% -0.15% on Facebook and between 0.05%-0.06% on Instagram. “This means bullying and harassment content was seen between 14 and 15 times per every 10,000 views of content on Facebook and between 5 and 6 times per 10,000 views of content on Instagram,” the company explains in a statement. Instagram in particular has faced questions about its ability to deal with bullying and harassment. The company introduced several new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-new-antibullying-features-and-photo-map-040107581.html">anti-bullying</a> measures earlier this year after several UK football players detailed their experience with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-cracks-down-harassment-direct-messages-185441529.html">racist abuse</a> on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the company notes that this “prevalence” metric only accounts for content Facebook and Instagram removes without a user report. That means the statistic is only capturing a subset of all bullying content, since bullying and harassment is not always easy for an automated system to identify.</p><p>That distinction has been underscored by revelations in the Facebook Papers, a trove of documents made public by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. According to documents she shared, Facebook’s own researchers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/">estimate</a> that the company is only able to address around three to five percent of hate speech on its platform, meaning the vast majority goes undetected and is allowed to pollute users’ News Feeds.</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html">pushed back</a> on these claims, and has pointed to the “prevalence” stats it shares in its transparency reports. But as researchers have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/">pointed out</a>, the company’s own accounting of “prevalence” can mask the true amount of violating content on the platform. That’s because Facebook’s automated systems are not always reliable, especially at detecting content in languages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184">other than English</a>. The revelations have fueled allegations that Facebook puts profits ahead of user safety.</p><p>“We have absolutely no incentive, whether it&#39;s commercial or otherwise, to do anything other than make sure people have a positive experience,” Rosen said Tuesday. “I think it&#39;s also just not true that our algorithms are just optimized to squeeze out engagement. We&#39;re constantly refining how we do ranking in order to tackle these problems.”</p><p>In its latest report, Facebook reported that hate speech had declined for the fourth straight quarter, with prevalence declining from 0.05% last quarter to 0.03% this quarter. The company also reported prevalence of hate speech on Instagram for the first time, saying hate speech was at 0.02% or around 2 out of every 10,000 pieces of content viewed on its platform.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that even the most optimistic take on these numbers — 0.03% and 0.02% for Facebook and Instagram, respectively — can still mean millions of people are encountering hate speech every day, given the vast number of users and pieces of content posted to the platforms each day.&nbsp;</p><p>Separately, Facebook also said<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-shift-to-generalized-ai-to-better-identify-violating-content"> its researchers</a> are working on &quot;a relatively new area of AI research called &#39;few-shot&#39; or &#39;zero-shot&#39; learning,&quot; which would enable them to train AI models much more rapidly. Instead of relying on massive datasets to manually train models for, say identifying hate speech, it would enable models that can &quot;learn to recognize something from just a small number of training examples, or even just a single example,&quot; the company wrote. Facebook didn&#39;t say how long it might take to put this research into action, but it suggests the company is still pursuing AI advancements to address major content issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-latest-transparency-report-details-bullying-and-harassment-on-facebook-and-instagram-182854231.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cc2ce7d-f079-4133-b8a4-b711a52cc572</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:28:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486339</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:32:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration logo of Meta is displayed on a mobile phone screen and apps icons on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkey on October 29, 2021.

The promotion comes with access to the platform&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crunchyroll-offline-viewing-subscription-tiers-145000647.html">Mega Fan tier</a>, which allows you to watch Crunchyroll&#39;s entire library of more than 1,000 anime titles without ads.

The fact it competes with Microsoft in the console market seems secondary to Sony here compared to the potential of attracting new customers to the service.

The company is rolling out a string of sleep-related improvements to Nest screens that include a catalog of Calm &quot;Sleep Stories.&quot; As of December, you can ask Google to &quot;start a meditation&quot; and your smart display will play audio to wind you down. You&#39;ll only have access to several tracks for free, but you can unlock the full library if you have a Calm Premium membership.</p><p>Other upgrades provide more detail for the tracking itself. The second-gen Nest Hub now provides details about sleeping stages, so you&#39;ll know how much time you spend in deep, light or REM sleep. You&#39;ll know how long any interruptions might have lasted, too. The Hub&#39;s sound detection also now focuses only on coughs and snores inside your designated sleeping area, so you&#39;ll know how much a partner (or noisy pet) is affecting your rest. All sounds beyond that area are lumped into an &quot;other sounds&quot; section.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracking features start reaching users today. They should be available to all users worldwide in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot;</p><p>Get ready to start paying for all these sleep aids, though. As previously hinted, Google plans to fold these Sleep Sensing features into Fitbit Premium starting in 2023. It&#39;s not certain just what you&#39;ll pay on launch (Fitbit Premium is currently $80 per year), but Google clearly intends to make a profit from its Nest Hubs beyond the initial hardware sale.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nest-hub-sleep-tracking-meditation-180443638.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3edb99ef-cf29-462d-b9ad-e3c851aa3664</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:04:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636481085</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T18:05:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/804c7110-4182-11ec-bfee-0b337a886040" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/804c7110-4182-11ec-bfee-0b337a886040" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub with Calm sleep meditation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub with Calm sleep meditation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic has sold 100 tickets to space since increasing flight prices to $450,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/virgin%20galactic/"><ins>Virgin Galactic</ins></a> reopened ticket sales for its trips to the edge of space <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html">at a higher price</a> back in August, and the company says it has sold 100 of the $450,000 tickets so far.

You can also expect to see Windows 11 SE devices are coming from Dell, HP, Acer and ASUS, among other PC makers.</p><p>Microsoft hasn&#39;t had the best luck with Windows variants over the years: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-07-microsoft-windows-10-s-mode.html">Windows 10 S</a> was a limp attempt at delivering a simpler experience for the original Surface Laptop, while the dual-screen focused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-windows-10x-dual-screen-pcs-surface-ne0.html">Windows 10X</a> was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-10x-dead-182353110.html">eventually cancelled</a>. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> basically rose from the ashes of Windows 10 X.) But according to Aaron Woodman, Microsoft&#39;s General Manager of Windows, this latest OS is more focused on solving a specific problem: How can Microsoft create the ideal OS experience for students and teachers?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3142b9e0-416d-11ec-9edf-2b2784f2d85a" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="ca75b81e-f201-3708-8f35-9c8b69e43bc8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Windows 11 SE attempts to do that by focusing on simplicity. There&#39;s no Microsoft Store for installing apps (though IT departments can deploy whatever Win32 and Universal apps they&#39;d like). It&#39;s optimized to run on slower hardware. And Microsoft even stripped down the window snapping options by only allowing apps to be on the left or right side of the screen. One of the best parts of Windows 11 is the easy way you can easily shove an app to different corners of your screen, but that&#39;s probably too complicated for elementary school-aged kids running notebooks with small screens.</p><p>The Surface Laptop SE is similarly basic by design. It&#39;s a plastic-shelled notebook that vaguely resembles the Surface Laptop line, especially the previous cheap entry, the $549 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-130030486.html">Surface Laptop Go</a>. It has an 11.6-inch TFT LCD screen with a 1,366 by 768 resolution — a step above 720p, but below the Laptop Go&#39;s sub-1080p display. And don&#39;t expect any powerful gear under the hood, as the Surface Laptop SE is limited to dual-core Celeron chips (either the N4020 or N4120), and either 4GB or 8GB of RAM. For storage, there&#39;s a choice between 64GB or 128GB eMMC cards.</p><p>But really, what else do you expect for a starting price of $249? What&#39;s more intriguing about the Surface Laptop SE are the more premium elements that still managed to find their way in. Microsoft brought over the Surface Laptop Go&#39;s excellent keyboard and trackpad, as well as its easy-opening lid, Woodman tells us. The Laptop SE also sports a 720p webcam, which is sharper than what we see on most similarly-priced notebooks. And, judging from a brief Teams video chat I had with Dave Alles, General Manager of Surface Laptop SE, its camera and microphone quality are shockingly solid too. (It was easily better than $1,200 laptops I&#39;ve reviewed.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31421da0-416d-11ec-bbfe-0b729851c285" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="b7facd1a-abb0-3ff4-b664-33a439e97928"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>For the most part, the Surface Laptop SE appears to be more than enough for a typical grade-school kid. It weighs 2.45 pounds, so it shouldn&#39;t be too tough to lug around in tiny backpacks. And its onboard storage, however meager, should be enough to work on Microsoft Office projects offline. Microsoft claims it&#39;ll get 16 hours of battery life with &quot;typical device usage.&quot; Woodman tells us that the designers had students without reliable internet access in mind. They could download assignments at school, work on them at home, and have their work automatically synchronized when they&#39;re back in class.</p><p>IT departments would likely appreciate the easily accessible screws on the bottom, making it simple to open up and repair notebooks on-site. The Laptop SE&#39;s low price should also make it easier for schools to acquire enough units for every student, instead of sharing a handful of PCs in class.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/31372120-416d-11ec-b6fe-3fb256c07afb" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop SE" data-uuid="e34a779f-ad3f-3bab-806d-64c23b314beb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>I&#39;m curious to see how well Windows 11 SE performs on the Laptop SE&#39;s slow hardware. And a part of me wonders if giving kids a more limited version of Windows will hurt their ability to tinker with PCs when they&#39;re older. But as a former IT support jockey, the Surface Laptop SE appears to be the cheap notebook I&#39;ve always wanted grade-school students to have. Sure, it&#39;s not as flexible as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$400" href="https://fave.co/2YrJdOv">$400</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-review-130025822.html">Surface Go 3</a>, but for basic coursework that won&#39;t matter too much. And while I liked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-130030486.html">Surface Laptop Go</a>, it starts at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$549" href="https://fave.co/3H702zW">$549</a>—so schools could buy two Laptop SEs for around the same price.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, Microsoft is only planning to sell the Laptop SE to schools through education resellers later this year. Normal consumers and businesses won&#39;t be able to order them at all. But if it&#39;s wildly successful, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Microsoft finds some way to bring this cheap computer to the masses.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-se-windows-11-se-170034899.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e2d960a-9da4-4430-bece-02ad4bfcd835</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 17:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636484490</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:01:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/313af1b0-416d-11ec-bfb9-23cf55b7650c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/313af1b0-416d-11ec-bfb9-23cf55b7650c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop SE]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop SE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm is trying to simplify app creation for AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Qualcomm is betting it can become a cornerstone in the augmented reality world.

The toolset includes tech to help understand environments and users (including gesture and hand tracking from the newly acquired HINS), software kits for 3D engines like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html">Unreal</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-30-openxr-1-launch.html">OpenXR</a> support and hooks for  platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-niantic-augmented-reality-metaverse-apps-193559416.html">Niantic&#39;s Lightship</a> and Unity&#39;s AR Foundation.</p><p>The ultimate aim is to make AR more accessible.

Spaces won&#39;t be widely available until spring 2022, but Qualcomm has lined up partners like Lenovo (including Motorola), Oppo and Xiaomi.

Twitter Blue, which unlocks additional features like the ability to “undo” a tweet or browse news without ads, is now available to users in the United States ($2.99/month) and New Zealand ($4.49/month).</p><p>The service is designed to appeal to Twitter’s most dedicated power users, with the kind of specialized features that have sometimes appeared in third-party Twitter clients. For example, Twitter Blue comes with an “undo” feature that’s likely the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-twitter-client-brizzly-launches-with-undo-tweet-feature.html">closest thing</a> to an edit button the company will ever make.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A subscription also buys several new customization tools, including the ability to rearrange which features appear as shortcuts in the app’s navigation bar, or the option to choose new color themes and app icons. Subscriptions also buy you early access to new features as Twitter tests them out. For now that includes video upload up to 10 minutes long (videos are capped at 2 minutes for non-paying users) and the ability to pin conversations to the top of your DM inbox. These experimental features “might eventually become available to the rest of Twitter, graduate to a feature of Twitter Blue, or sunset based on feedback we hear from subscribers,” the company says.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6adbe680-4178-11ec-bfee-6eb5da6042ab" alt="Twitter Blue lets you read news without ads." data-uuid="f48bf64a-8274-385a-aecb-68dc30331907"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Notably, the latest iteration of Twitter Blue also comes with two new features powered by the company’s recent acquisition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-acquires-scroll-subscription-service-171621757.html">of Scroll</a>, a startup that partnered with publishers to offer ad-free content. Twitter Blue subscribers are now able to access ad-free articles from more than 300 publishers, including <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>BuzzFeed </em>and <em>Rolling Stone</em>.</p><p>It’s somewhat similar to Google’s AMP or Facebook’s Instant Articles in that articles are meant to load quickly and cleanly. But unlike those programs, where readers are directed to stripped down article pages, Twitter Blue articles will still open directly on the publisher’s website. Tony Haile, the former Scroll CEO who now is the senior director of longform at Twitter, says the company is trying to build “win-win partnerships” with publishers who retain “complete control of the experience.”</p><p>Though the company hasn’t disclosed the terms of these arrangements, a portion of each Twitter Blue subscription goes directly to publishers, Haile said. And subscribers will also get access to a dashboard in the Twitter app that breaks down your news-reading habits and how much revenue your clicks are bringing to the publishers you read most often. “Our goal is to help each publishing partner make 50% more per person than they would’ve made from serving ads to that person.” Twitter writes in a blog post.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/866f6110-4178-11ec-b938-0ec57e61d172" alt="Twitter Blue brings back some of Nuzzel with &#39;top articles.&#39;" data-uuid="f8a0bb1a-041f-368c-8370-d8c6a0d94a21"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Finally, Twitter Blue comes with a “top articles” feature that brings in some functionality from the niche but highly regarded news app Nuzzel, which was<a href="https://siliconangle.com/2021/05/04/twitter-buys-scroll-new-aggregator-nuzzel-way/"> shuttered</a> earlier this year. Like the original app, the new “top articles” feature will curate a list of the top stories shared by people in your Twitter network over the last 24 hours. (Former Nuzzel fans will be happy to learn they can pin the new “top articles” section directly to their nav bar from the in-app settings menu.)</p><p>The expansion of Twitter Blue comes amid a broader shift for the company, which has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html">shaking up</a> many of its core features for the first time in its 15-year history. Elsewhere, the company has embraced creator-centric features like Super Follows and Ticketed Spaces, and is building out a newsletter platform. Twitter Blue is different, though, because the company is hoping to draw in its most hardcore users rather than attract new voices to its platform.</p><p>But it’s unclear just how many of those users will be willing to pay for those extra features. The company has been testing Twitter Blue in Australia and Canada since early June, but hasn’t shared on early adoption or other metrics for the service, Twitter said Tuesday it will continue to add new features and will be paying close attention to user feedback.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-expands-3-dollar-twitter-blue-subscriptions-to-the-us-163018030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a2c73ac-207e-49a0-a1fd-87fda513f817</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 16:30:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486963</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:42:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4a5cf610-4178-11ec-bdfe-6b3c1844134f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4a5cf610-4178-11ec-bdfe-6b3c1844134f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter Blue comes with an "undo" feature.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[tweet undo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The video games we wish someone would gift us]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We regularly write about the games we love at Engadget, and even have &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/best%20games/">best games</a>&quot; lists for each console.

Instead, it would start out with 22nm and 28nm parts.

Sony and TSMC only expect to start construction of the factory sometime in 2022, and the plant won&#39;t start production until sometime before the end of 2024. The initial crunch that prompted the effort may have been solved by then.

It will suggest classes that target muscles you might have overlooked lately. In addition, Peloton Guide has a voice activation mode. You can start, stop, rewind and fast forward a class. The feature will be available in the US, Canada and the UK at the outset (for what it&#39;s worth, Peloton&#39;s bikes only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-plus-pause-button-tread-205410305.html"><ins>just got a pause button</ins></a> for on-demand classes).</p><p>In terms of privacy, you&#39;ll be able to put the system to sleep, slide a cover over the camera and turn off the microphone with a physical switch, though the company <a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409958503444">says</a> the microphone won&#39;t be on or listening unless you&#39;re in a class. Peloton plans to improve the system over time by training the machine learning model on more movements and disciplines, and increasing the number of classes and training programs.

The Peloton App offers some strength classes, while unofficial groups and tags focused on strength now boast nearly 250,000 community members.</p><p>Peloton Guide is the company&#39;s least expensive device to date. It costs $495 US / $645 CAD / £450 / €495. The system, which comes with a remote and the updated Peloton Heart Rate Band, will arrive in the US and Canada in early 2022. It will hit the UK, Australia and Germany later next year.</p><p>The Heart Rate Band, which will be an armband rather than the current chest strap, will be available separately early next year for $89, and is compatible with Peloton&#39;s other products. Peloton says it will discontinue the existing Heart Rate Monitor in the coming months.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that, as with Peloton&#39;s other products, you&#39;ll need a subscription to use it. The Peloton Guide Membership costs $13 USD / $17 CAD / £13 / €13 per month, and allows five people to work out with the system. A membership is included with Peloton&#39;s All-Access subscription (which many Bike and Tread owners will already have).</p><p>Peloton Guide is not going to be for everyone. Some people won&#39;t be comfortable seeing themselves on a screen as they&#39;re working out. But for those who do strength training at home and aren&#39;t sure that their form is right, it could fit the bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/peloton-guide-machine-learning-strength-training-152637209.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3c3064c-b8cf-4b2e-84c8-f881bc5c7e3e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 15:26:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636471601</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T15:26:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c728ca70-416e-11ec-bbff-873f66f9127d" width="1200" height="640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c728ca70-416e-11ec-bbff-873f66f9127d" width="1200" height="640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person working out during a Peloton Guide strength training class.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Peloton Guide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The books and movies we’re gifting this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having somehow made it through a second year of global pandemic and political unrest, give the loved ones on your holiday shopping list the greatest gift of all: an alternative to doom-scrolling.

The company has introduced <a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-platform-for-creating-ai-avatars">Omniverse Avatar</a> (for 3D assistant creation) and <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/11/09/riva-enterprise-custom-voice-speech-ai/">Riva</a> (custom AI voice creation) platforms that, combined, lead to surprisingly realistic virtual personas with relatively little effort — or, in one case, deliberately unrealistic.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIaUhWXjzwo">one demo</a>, used to highlight NVIDIA&#39;s AI-powered Maxine toolkit, the company created an Omniverse Avatar from a woman&#39;s photo and used Riva to train the voice based on that woman, convert text to speech and translate to different languages. The digital stand-in looks and sounds much like the real person (aside from a couple of stiff-sounding translations), and can even turn its head while maintaining natural-looking eye contact. As you might imagine, this could lead to more relatable virtual helpers at kiosks and websites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5b9a6e465f904c10bd3a638330ed4964"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jIaUhWXjzwo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9Zh57dGsH4">Another demo</a>, for NVIDIA&#39;s Project Tokkio &quot;talking kiosk&quot; reference app, shows what could happen when you created a wholly artificial character. The tech showcase centers on a 3D, ray-traced toy version of CEO Jensun Huang (complete with his signature outfit and a Riva-trained voice) using AI to hold a conversation with real people on subjects like climate change and the role of proteins in the body. Various Omniverse systems animate his face and hands. It&#39;s not meant to be highly authentic, of course, but it shows how you can craft a 3D virtual assistant considerably more engaging than a disembodied voice.</p><div id="d9d93bb57d7147419dae905ca7c97023"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9Zh57dGsH4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Most of the Maxine development kit is already available. Riva is usable now in an open beta, and will be free for &quot;small-scale&quot; work. Larger rollouts will depend on a Riva Enterprise program launching early in 2022. You&#39;ll have to wait longer for Omniverse Avatar, though. While the basic Omniverse platform is in open beta now, Avatar is only &quot;under development&quot; with no specified launch date. Still, this points to a future where an airport or favorite restaurant can provide an assistant that&#39;s (hopefully) useful without seeming too robotic.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ai-voice-avatar-omniverse-project-tokkio-142456487.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9303bcd6-a08e-4816-a7b3-78ec3ba3d81e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 14:24:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636467898</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T14:25:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e38a840-4160-11ec-a7f5-89406dc123a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e38a840-4160-11ec-a7f5-89406dc123a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar toy version of Jensen Huang]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar toy version of Jensen Huang]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 are on sale for $100 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s affordable Galaxy Buds 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">impressed us</a> with all of the premium features they offer at a decent $150 price tag.

THX says the AAA-78 makes the Onyx just as powerful as a desktop DAC or amplifier setup, but obviously it&#39;s much smaller.

Now, Amazon is offering the 8GB and 16GB models at the lowest prices we&#39;ve seen at $749 and $849, respectively — $100 and $150 off the regular prices.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/301dqVc" id="1d3b87d5b0674409a57857c89fb9271b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Google Pixelbook Go i5">Buy Pixelbook Go i5 8GB at Amazon - $749</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BT1pOU" id="5e391eec8f7c4ac2bd9a4555b203c9be" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Google PixelBook Go i5 16GB">Buy Pixelbook Go i5 16GB at Amazon - $849</a><p>Most of Google&#39;s past Pixelbooks offered bleeding edge design and performance at a price of $1,000 or more, at a time when most Chromebook&#39;s cost under $100. The company changed that equation with the current Pixelbook Go, a premium yet affordable Chromebook with performance to spare.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The design is more basic than the sophisticated glass-and-aluminum designs that came before it. While it&#39;s around the same weight as the previous Pixelbook, it&#39;s considerably thicker and more rounded. It&#39;s arguably more practical, though, thanks to the easy-to-grip ridged base and display that you can open with just one hand.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, it shines where it counts. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-google-pixelbook-go-review.html">Engadget review</a>, we noted that the Pixelbook Go delivered good performance and battery life, outshining most Chromebook models out there. That&#39;s helped by the Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB or 16GB of RAM, which is more than enough to power Chrome OS. It also comes with an excellent keyboard that offers plenty of travel.&nbsp;</p><p>The only drawbacks are a 1080p display that&#39;s not quite as good as the original and a trackpad that isn&#39;t the smoothest. Still, for the sale price of $749, the Pixel Go i5 is easily one of the best Chromebooks you can get.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixelbook-go-i-5-falls-to-an-all-time-low-at-amazon-132316033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc49f658-6bea-459f-804b-22e2e5702bf6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 13:23:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636464200</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T13:23:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/13366730-4159-11ec-bffe-91a5bdf24e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/13366730-4159-11ec-bffe-91a5bdf24e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google's Pixelbook Go i5 falls to an all-time low at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google's Pixelbook Go i5 falls to an all-time low at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon will accept Venmo payments starting in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting next year, you&#39;ll be able to use the money anybody <a href="https://www.engadget.com/venmo-payment-app-redesign-160045898.html">Venmos</a> you to buy products directly from Amazon — so long as you live in the US.

Much like Google and other types of news feeds, the content shown is based on your proximity to the business, the freshness of content and a dish&#39;s popularity.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you click on a restaurant&#39;s dish, you&#39;ll be directed to see more photos and reviews of that dish. Yelp uses machine learning to pick out those dishes based on reviews, then pairs them with photos and reviews of the dish. Clicking on other images, like the interior or exterior of a restaurant, will take you to the business page and show you more photos and info.</p><p>The other feature, Yelp Connect, is a paid feature for restaurant owners. It allows businesses to share updates with new and existing customers directly to home feed, helping their posts gain visibility (and Yelp more ad revenue, no doubt). Yelp said that it&#39;s initial testing showed it may lift a restaurant&#39;s consumer engagement up to 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>The new experience is arriving today on iOS exclusively in 150 cities in 25 US states, Yelp said. There&#39;s no word yet on an Android release, but the company said to &quot;stay tuned for additional updates.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yelps-new-home-page-makes-it-easier-to-discover-local-restaurants-120042081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2879dab-f9b1-4ff7-8423-54ea4cf32695</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 12:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636447324</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T08:42:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e778660-4135-11ec-987c-aed1e00f3939" width="1500" height="890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e778660-4135-11ec-987c-aed1e00f3939" width="1500" height="890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yelp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yelp's new iOS home fee makes it easier to discover local restaurants]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yelp's new iOS home fee makes it easier to discover local restaurants]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix is bringing a TikTok-style feed of short 'Kids Clips' to its app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix will roll out a new TikTok-inspired featured that specifically targets its younger viewers this week, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/netflix-to-roll-out-tiktok-like-short-clip-feature-aimed-at-kids?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The streaming giant is reportedly launching &quot;Kids Clips&quot; on its iOS app, which will show short video clips from its library of children&#39;s programming to help young viewers find something to watch. Bloomberg says the feature builds upon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html">Fast Laughs</a>, the comedy feed it launched earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Fast Laughs, however, Kids Clips videos will be horizontal instead of vertical and will take over the entire screen. In addition, kids will only be able to view 10 to 20 clips at any one time. Netflix will add new clips every day based on the current shows and movies available on the platform, as well as future ones slated to arrive on the service. Both features are part of the company&#39;s efforts to combat decision fatigue, which ails many of its subscribers. Netflix also launched a shuffle play feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-android-launch-140045356.html">Play Something</a> back in October to help viewers find something to watch based on their viewing patterns without having to scroll endlessly through the app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix still refers Kids Clips as a &quot;test,&quot; <em>Bloomberg</em> said, and it won&#39;t be available to all its users just yet. For now, it&#39;s rolling out in select markets, including the US, Canada, Australia, Ireland and Latin American countries.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-kids-clips-112219037.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d460b32a-37a4-43cf-a636-84488a6ad6c1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 11:22:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636458081</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T11:41:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/246baa20-4144-11ec-b7de-91f27bdf8674" width="1600" height="1027" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/246baa20-4144-11ec-b7de-91f27bdf8674" width="1600" height="1027" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
