TimTheTatman (aka Tim Betar) has <a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766?s=21">announced</a> he will <a href="https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA?amp=1">stream</a> &quot;exclusively&quot; on YouTube Gaming as of September 2nd. He didn&#39;t explain the reasons behind the leap, but it comes less than two years after he (plus DrLupo and Saqib &quot;Lirik&quot; Zahid) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitch-drlupo-lirik-timthetatman-streaming-contract-loaded-deal.html">signed a multi-year deal with Twitch</a>.</p><p>Twitch didn&#39;t issue a formal response. It <a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1433101184479399937">wished</a> TimTheTatman well on Twitter, though, saying the streamer would &quot;always be a King&quot; to the service he left.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not yet certain this represents a second wave of defections from Twitch. Microsoft spurred the first round, paying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-ninja-twitch-mixer-fortnite.html">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-shroud-twitch-mixer-ninja.html">Shroud</a> and other top streamers to jump ship for Mixer. We wouldn&#39;t expect a similar outcome, though. Mixer struggled to compete against its livestreaming rivals, leading Microsoft to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mixer-ninja-shroud-streamers-twitch-youtube-facebook-163007393.html">shut the service down</a>. Creators had to quickly find alternatives, and some of them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ninja-twitch-mixer-streaming-170015433.html">returned to Twitch</a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shroud-twitch-return-first-stream-time-193742742.html">exclusivity deals</a>. YouTube is in a considerably stronger position, even if it&#39;s not the dominant home for live game streaming.</p><p>Even so, the moves represent gambles for TimTheTatman, DrLupo and others who might follow suit. While many larger creators have an established YouTube presence for their on-demand videos, that doesn&#39;t guarantee they&#39;ll watch live shows on Google&#39;s service. Even so, this could be a coup for YouTube — and a blow to Twitch if it can&#39;t hold on to its best-known stars.</p><div id="1f3cf3f968f1434b9c846dceb34fa821"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the future<a href="https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA">https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA</a><a href="https://t.co/ekGwDreHOL">pic.twitter.com/ekGwDreHOL</a></p>— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) <a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9f6438a-dca3-47a1-9ea7-99938549598d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:07:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630515244</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:54:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TimTheTatman/Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests new harassment prevention feature with ‘Safety Mode’]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is experimenting with its most aggressive anti-harassment features to date.

It’s just two minutes long and filled with overlapping shots of drums, mics, guitars and snakelike cables packed into a lonely desert hideaway, all while an unsettling, ambient score gathers layers of sound. Over time, the scenes are flooded with red and the film is overcome by a horrendous groaning scream. Thin white text flashes across the screen, telling a disjointed story about burying bones and walking with the bloom of a burgeoning universe.</p><p>Among this vibrating chaos, there are hints about the kind of studio Eyes Out will be and even what the team’s first game might look like. Or, more aptly, what it might sound like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="80075cd5f57b4007b643c0b11713e1a0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Doja9yZOBuU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Eyes Out is the new video game studio founded by Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck and veteran AAA director Cory Davis, and the team is already hard at work on its first title, a mysterious horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio.</p><p>“We want to create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality,” Davis said. “That&#39;s what we&#39;re really excited about. We’re all fans of horror, but specifically this kind of — it&#39;s a new and emerging space that doesn&#39;t just sit within the extremely violent and dark and terrifying, but also reaches into the vibrant and even surprises you with moments of bliss or self-reflection. Horror really has a lot of room to grow.”</p><p>Finck added on to that thought, saying, “We&#39;re playing in this field that provides an emotional and psychological response, which really, I feel, is heightened as a singular experience. And we&#39;re really fortunate to be attracting developers who are so genuinely passionate about these types of conversations.”</p><p>Davis has built a successful career as a video game designer, directing and crafting high-profile titles including <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> and <em>Here They Lie</em>, but he’s also a composer. In fact, the first word of his <a href="https://twitter.com/Snak3Fist">Twitter bio</a> reads, “musician.” Meanwhile, Finck’s <a href="https://twitter.com/robinfinck?lang=en">Twitter bio</a> has just two tags, both of which speak for themselves: @eyesoutofficial and @nineinchnails.</p><p>Note which one comes first.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d85e60-0a95-11ec-bae8-c275210803da" alt="Eyes Out" data-uuid="3922fa90-6df7-3b58-a539-91f9d4c33048"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Eyes Out</div></figure><p>Finck got involved in the video game industry about six years ago, after striking up a friendship with Devolver Digital co-founder Mike Wilson at Burning Man. Finck ended up handling the soundtrack for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-01-nine-inch-nails-guitarist-robin-finck-soundtrack-noct.html"><em>Noct</em></a>, a top-down horror game published by Devolver in 2015, and his interest in development was piqued. He dove further into the video game industry, attending conventions and connecting with creators.</p><p>“I was just really inspired by people and their enthusiasm, the forward tech of it all, and the collision of art and music, design, agency, narrative, and also the experience of really becoming immersed in all of this,” Finck said. “It really feels like the most focused and the most highly attuned experience to imbibe this sort of storytelling. And that continues to turn me on. And this led me, fortunately enough for me, to meet Cory as he and his team were completing <em>Here They Lie</em>.”</p><p>Eventually, Finck found himself at Sony Santa Monica, playing an early version of Davis’ VR horror title, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05018_00-DANA000PS4000123/"><em>Here They Lie</em></a>. He was floored by it. Finck and Davis got to talking, and they haven’t stopped since.</p><p>“We immediately were talking about sound and music and the weight of that and the experience,” Finck said. “And we kept on in the coming days and weeks and months. And then eventually were working together on music for projects that Cory was heralding. We have a <em>simpatico</em> workflow and creatively sync in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Davis remembered feeling a spark at that first meeting, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aaf39f9096f749c3a479ead7ffe2d9f8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d2b910-0a95-11ec-bbb7-1a3ebe2790f0" alt="Eyes Out"></section><p>“We started to go down the rabbit hole of distortion pedals and different synthesizers and stuff like that,” he said. “But that led us to this other type of discussion where I really felt this connection in terms of an understanding of the power of games as a medium and the impact and the possibility of what the medium holds for the future.”</p><p>Davis and Finck were both interested in building a single-player experience around music and tone, rather than starting with a narrative or visual style and applying sound later on in the process.</p><p>“From the first conversation with Robin, I could feel that he&#39;s this other type of creator that wants to be driven by his passion and his soul, rather than maybe what&#39;s trendy or what&#39;s even necessarily gratifying,” Davis said. “I just felt this kind of depth of possibility of what we could do together. I had other prototypes going on at the time at my old studio, but every time I got back together with Robin, our conversations would go deeper. And they&#39;d go beyond the music and they&#39;d go to places where I&#39;d been hoping to go my whole journey as a game developer.”</p><p>Eyes Out is the result of this creative magnetism between Davis and Finck. They’ve attracted other developers, too, and have hired <a href="https://www.eyes-out.com/team">15 collaborators</a> from the industries of visual art, film and games to work on their first project.</p><p>“That&#39;s really what I&#39;ve been looking for since way back in the <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> days, was to build a team that has a diverse enough approach to both things like the difficulties in game development, as well as their acceptance and embrace of people that are from different parts of the world, from different backgrounds, that are of any kind of personality, and especially people that have been downtrodden and haven&#39;t had opportunities in the past,” Davis said. “We see those opportunities allowing us to have so much more depth in the types of stories that we&#39;re able to tell.”</p><div id="5a27248a9d864e09bd8b483f60ba04b3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaAmzYSBCeI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There’s no name or release window for the studio’s first game, but Davis and Finck are dropping hints about how it’ll play and what they want players to feel. It’s not a VR game, it’s designed with complete immersion in mind, and it features creatures that behave strangely in response to generative audio cues. The team is playing around with rhythm mechanics and figuring out how to build creeping tension through sound.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>The debut game from Eyes Out will be a focused, single-player horror experience built around sound — and silence.</p><p>“I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater,” Finck said. “And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Eyes Out&#39;s first project is poised to be otherworldly, introspective and experimental, just like the studio itself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">486bf9ba-6ea0-4d85-a85a-e4f1e54ad3ff</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:45:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630513787</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:30:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[RAINER HOSCH]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eyes Out co-founders Cory Davis and Robin Finck.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eyes Out]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm aptX Lossless delivers CD quality sound over Bluetooth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, if you wanted to stream lossless audio tracks to your phone, you essentially had one option: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-tidal-master-audio-android.html"><ins>Tidal</ins></a>. A lot has changed since then, with Apple recently rolling out support for lossless streaming in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html"><ins>June</ins></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> promising to do the same later this year. But unless you’re willing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html"><ins>connect a USB DAC</ins></a> to your phone, more streaming services jumping on the Hi-Res bandwagon does you little good since Bluetooth headphones can only stream lossy audio. Thankfully, that’s about to change.</p><p>Chipmaker Qualcomm is adding a new flavor to its aptX Bluetooth codec, and it’s a lossless one that, in ideal conditions, the company claims delivers CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection. Qualcomm says it made improvements to its Bluetooth High Speed Link technology to deliver the required data throughput required to stream a lossless track wirelessly, but the codec can also compress a signal down to 24-bit 96kHz quality to ensure you don&#39;t experience any interruptions. You can also manually switch between 16-bit 44.1kHz and 24-bit 96kHz streaming modes, though the codec will automatically default to the former when it detects a lossless source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets come with support for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html"><ins>aptX codecs</ins></a> built-in. That means almost any Android phone you buy in North America or Europe will support the standard. As with all Bluetooth codecs, it’s not enough for only your phone, tablet or computer to support the technology. You also need a pair of compatible headphones or earbuds. Qualcomm says the first ones to support aptX Lossless will arrive later this year.</p><p>Before today, the closest you could get to a lossless connection over Bluetooth were Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/"><ins>LDAC</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00230269"><ins>DSEE technologies</ins></a>.

This is ostensibly to allow for more flexible home theater installations, although we could see those smaller sizes proving useful for bedrooms, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-health-qled-tv-smart-trainer-hands-on-160027517.html">connected home gyms</a> and dorm rooms.</p><p>There are additional size options for Lifestyle sets, too. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-portrait-mode-160035463.html">The Frame</a> is now available in an 85-inch size for fans of extra-large artwork, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">The Terrace</a> Full Sun can be had in a 65-inch edition for backyard viewing in bright sunlight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn&#39;t initially provide pricing for all of the new sets (we&#39;ve asked for details). However, you can order the 50-inch QN90A today <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung Neo QLED 4K QN90A 50-inch TV" href="https://fave.co/38yt1MS">for $1,400</a> (normally $1,500), while the 65-inch The Terrace Full Sun is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung The Terrace Full Sun 65-inch" href="https://fave.co/3Bzxz1U">$10,000</a>. None of these new sets is likely to be a trivial purchase, then, but they could be welcome moves if you don&#39;t want to sacrifice quality just to get a TV that fits your living space.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-neo-qled-the-frame-tv-sizes-160601805.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9cfebcc-c178-4730-8051-c9a98b93061e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:06:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630512364</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:06:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a8c30fc0-0b39-11ec-beab-9fb73f5a30cb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a8c30fc0-0b39-11ec-beab-9fb73f5a30cb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED QN90A 4K TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED QN90A 4K TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft will hold a Surface event on September 22nd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> will hold its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event/">next event</a> on September 22nd, where it will show off the latest Surface hardware.

The social media giant has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/">launched</a> a Fantasy Games feature in the US and Canada with &quot;free, simple&quot; sports and pop culture prediction titles. The fantasy sports  offerings let you predict winners for matches, top players and other stats. MLB Home Run Picks asks you to predict the team with the most home runs in a given day, for instance, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/espn-plus-la-liga-soccer-rights-005834427.html">La Liga</a> Winning Streak challenges you to predict daily wins in the Spanish soccer league for as long as possible.</p><p>You can also guess the victors in reality TV shows like <em>Survivor</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em>.

However, there are still plenty of incentives for the social network to launch Fantasy Games. The feature could keep you coming back, boosting ad revenue as well as your overall engagement with Facebook. It also opens the door to paid fantasy games in the future. Still, this might hit the spot if you&#39;ve been tempted by fantasy sports but don&#39;t want to spend real money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-fantasy-sports-pop-culture-games-142705123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fea8f738-6183-4381-971d-85e4599718a3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 14:27:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630506428</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T14:27:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fantasy Sports]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says eight states have signed up to let people store IDs in Wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Residents of some states will soon be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html"><ins>add their driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet</ins></a>, and Apple has revealed which states will support the initiative at the outset.

You’ll need to scan the card with your phone and take a selfie for verification by your state. When you tap your device at TSA checkpoints, it will display a prompt listing the info that the agency is asking for. Once you authorize the request with Face ID or Touch ID, your iPhone or Apple Watch will share those details with the TSA, so you don’t even need to show your device to an agent or scanner.</p><p>Apple says it will store your ID securely.

As <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-self-driving-shuttles-paralympics-crash-pedestrian/">reports</a>, the automaker has <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35956185.html">resumed</a> use of its self-driving shuttle at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-epalette-tokyo-paralympic-games-collision-201745169.html">following a collision</a> with a visually impaired athlete. Not surprisingly, both Toyota and the games&#39; Organizing Committee have made changes in light of the crash — they&#39;ve determined that both the autonomous vehicle and the circumstances around it were to blame.</p><p>The company noted there were only two guide people at the intersection where the collision occurred, making it difficult for them to watch all vehicles and pedestrians at the same time. There also wasn&#39;t a &quot;sufficient&quot; way of coordinating between guides and vehicle operators (such as the manual &#39;backups&#39; for the e-Palette). It simply wasn&#39;t possible to ensure safety at this signal-free intersection without everyone working together, Toyota said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has upgrade the e-Palette itself with louder approach warning sounds, more crew members and tweaks to manual acceleration and braking. Organizers, meanwhile, have increased the number of guides, created an alternative to traffic signals, and split those guides into groups devoted to pedestrians and vehicles. Toyota and the Committee vowed to refine the system on a &quot;daily basis&quot; through the rest of the Paralympics, which end on September 5th.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear if these changes will be enough. However, this does serve as a reminder that self-driving vehicle tech is still in its infancy — it could be a while before Toyota and other brands can completely trust <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-toyota-denso-chip-manufacture.html">onboard computing power</a> to safely navigate streets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-resumes-self-driving-e-palette-use-paralympics-132634264.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98c872c8-eb74-4c7a-82a3-a24378b9569f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:26:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630503127</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T13:32:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tomohiro Ohsumi via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 23: Toyota Motor Corp.'s e-Palette Concept autonomous vehicle is displayed during a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show on October 23, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.

We&#39;ve only seen it cheaper in June during Prime Day when it was an additional $300 off.

It includes separate red, green and blue lasers so it can cover the full Rec.2020 color range, which is something even most high-end TVs cannot boast. This is as close as you&#39;ll get to a true 4K projector too, and it supports HDR10+ and up to 2,800 lumens of brightness.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That 4.2.2 surround sound system completes the package, allowing you to get close to a theatrical experience in your living room or backyard.

Running on Samsung&#39;s Tizen operating system for smart TVs, you can ask Alexa, the Google Assistant or Bixby to do things for you as well as stream from services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and others.

Because I apparently lack any amount of common sense, I recently took a 3,000-mile RV trip with my partner and two toddlers. Traveling with little ones can be stressful because they rely so much on their established routines; anything that deviates from that is going to be hard for them and you.</p><p>While we tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy by bringing along familiar toys and blankets, we also took the advice of a close friend who is an early childhood development specialist. She recommended keeping our twins engaged and entertained by grouping toys or activities together and rotating them throughout the day. Here are a few things that we tried that we’ll be returning to the next time we travel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Music</h2><p>Depending on how you’re traveling, music can be a great way to entertain tiny travelers. The repetition in children’s songs help kids learn patterns and expand their vocabulary. What’s more, musical play encourages movement along with both fine and gross motor skills. That’s great if you’re in a car where you can clap, sing and wiggle, but gets more challenging when you’re stuck on an aircraft with dozens of other people who don’t want to hear “Old MacDonald” seven(-ty-seven) times in a row.</p><h3>Instruments</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5a817050-0a70-11ec-bedf-f60dcbd0a7c3" style="height:969;width:1400;" alt="Sesame Street Music Player" data-uuid="6cad224e-2da6-3338-b521-462f40a2828e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sesame Street</div></figure><p>My mom bought us this “<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:CD player" href="https://amzn.to/38qfK8Z">CD player</a>” for our trip and weeks later, the twins are still fighting over it. My daughter really likes the music, my son really likes taking the “CD” out repeatedly to figure out how the player works, and they both like the colorful book of lyrics. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fisher Price" href="https://amzn.to/38lKNmo">Fisher Price</a> has a similar option with light-up buttons, which is perfect for occupying little hands.</p><p>Another cool gadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-educational-toys-for-kids-123055311.html">we’ve recommended</a> in the past is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blipbox" href="https://amzn.to/3kyCTvE">Blipbox</a>, an entry-level synthesizer that comes with 300 melodies and a synchronized light show. It contains a digital synth engine that includes an amp envelope, two LFOs, a modulation envelope and a low-pass filter — perfect for teaching kids about creating music while also entertaining their caretakers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38qfK8Z" id="f978a3306c344561bf3c7c4aa6e3dca6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Sesame Street CD player at Amazon - $10</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38lKNmo" id="b4a732fdbdd14e38bc5ea09ca5e9a6c3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fisher Price CD player at Amazon - $19</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3kyCTvE" id="ab55662e657646f6ac79901482b90323" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blipbox at Amazon - $189</a><h3>Spotify playlists</h3><p>When my twins were infants, the only thing that got them to sleep was playing Maxence Cyrin’s version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NZdggNUvq0">“Where is my mind?”</a> on repeat. We still have a classical playlist of songs for when it’s time to sleep, but I also keep a playlist of songs that are entertaining for adult passengers as well (think: “Yellow Submarine” and songs by They Might Be Giants). It’s nice both to switch up the endless parade of nursery rhymes and expose them to different types of music.</p><h3>YouTube playlists</h3><p>On the other hand, kids respond to nursery rhymes because they incorporate simple melodies, repetition and actions (some of which can be easy to do while seated). YouTube has dozens of long playlists of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlvIFV_8v7Q">classic nursery rhymes</a>, some of which include the lyrics, which is helpful if you’re like me and have long forgotten the words to “Three Blind Mice.”</p><h3>Podcasts</h3><p>Older kids might enjoy one of the many educational podcasts out there. As a bonus, if they’re able to keep headphones on for a decent stretch of time, this makes for a good airplane option, too. As an avid podcast fan myself, I’m excited for my twins to be old enough to enjoy them with me, and I’ve already bookmarked several to try out. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids">But Why?</a> podcast from NPR answers questions that kids send in themselves from “how do you make ice cream?” to “why do we wear clothes?” If your kid is into science, try <a href="https://www.brainson.org/episodes">Brains On</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencepodcastforkids.com/">Tumble</a> to explore topics like “how far can a cloud travel?’ and “how to become an astronaut.”</p><p>For more narrative style podcasts, check out <a href="https://www.littlestoriestinypeople.com/">Little Stories for Tiny People</a> or <a href="https://bedtime.fm/storytime">Story Time</a>. And for those kids, and parents, who are into exploring different musical genres, there’s <a href="https://saturdaycerealbowl.podbean.com/">the Saturday Morning Cereal Bowl</a> and <a href="https://sparetherock.com/wordpress/">Spare the Rock, Spoil the Child</a> podcasts, which feature songs from the Orb, Cake and Bob Marley.</p><h2>Interactive</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818d8bc0-df5a-11eb-bf7f-16d114f3b674" style="height:1200;width:2000;" alt="Montessori Busy Board for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="29271609-9441-3879-ab86-e71cee7c7280"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / deMoca</div></figure><p>Being stuck in a car or plane seat for long periods of time can make it challenging to find activities that involve younger kids’ need to explore, but there are still a few options. Most notably, a kids camera, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Action Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3gEu1Up">Action Cam</a> or the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Creator Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3jybefm">Creator Cam</a> from VTech, can help them stay amused. They can document the trip with photos, videos and use stop-motion or time-lapse effects. The Action Cam can be mounted on a bike and comes with a waterproof case, while the Creator Cam comes with a small tripod and includes more than 20 animated backgrounds that the kids can use to spice up their photos and videos.</p><p>For kids younger than the recommended age for a camera, I like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:busy boards" href="https://amzn.to/3zp3FNo">busy boards</a>. Car time with my twins has become a lot easier since we got a few of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:soft, zippered activity books" href="https://amzn.to/38kD3RO">soft, zippered activity books</a> that feature a variety of buckles, zippers and clasps for them to fiddle with.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3gEu1Up" id="3573f82060f1429889b521fa2a7110bc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy VTech action cam at Amazon - $53</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3jybefm" id="149f623d3f2e4671a0f721e85e73f390" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy VTech creator cam at Amazon - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zp3FNo" id="7549df587a5e47aeb99ee37920e93ce3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy deMoca busy board at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/38kD3RO" id="dcdd845b91d341d1b797cd5588eb6b3a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy deMoca quiet book at Amazon - $80</a><h2>Arts and crafts</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e72d66d0-0a70-11ec-bffd-faefb03f174d" style="height:1059;width:1500;" alt="Etch A Sketch" data-uuid="6ade36a0-025b-300c-888a-e64fe489e58d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Etch A Sketch</div></figure><p>If your child is into arts and crafts, you’re not out of luck when traveling (although maybe leave the glitter at home).

It&#39;s not such a far-fetched story, seeing as the tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">recently announced</a> its own mobile chip called Tensor that&#39;s slated to debut on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro.

The first Macs and iPad Pros powered by Apple&#39;s M1 processor launched in 2020, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">first iMacs</a> with the chip became available earlier this year. Google&#39;s in-progress Chromebook chip is reportedly based on designs from Softbank&#39;s ARM, like most mobile processors out there. By building the processor itself, the company will be able to customize it to meet its needs and to add its own features. It&#39;ll lessen Google&#39;s reliance on third-party suppliers, in other words, allowing it to control production as it sees fit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google plans to release the processors it&#39;s developing for Chromebooks in 2023, <em>Nikkei</em> says.

Locast has lost the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-cbs-abc-nbc-fox-sue-locast-copyright-infringement.html">courtroom skirmish</a> started by CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox, which said that the company was violating their copyright. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/broadcasters-locast-copyright-lawsuit-1234825244/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports that the quartet’s request for summary judgment was granted, saying that it couldn’t use its non-profit status as a defense against further action.</p><p>The big four, of course, don’t believe Locast’s aims were anywhere near as public-minded as the company made out. The body was reportedly backed, in part, by AT&amp;T and Dish Network, and the networks feel that the whole project was set up as a way of dodging carriage fees. Part of Locast’s defense was that US copyright law allows third parties to boost local signals, and that it acted like a signal booster station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s worth noting that Locast’s founder David Goodfriend, a lawyer and former FCC legal advisor, conceived of Locast in the wake of Aero’s destruction at the hands of the big networks. A 2019 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/business/locast-streaming-free-network-tv.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> profile explained that he had designed the legal situation to be “compliant within the law.” The profile is even titled that the company would “love to get sued” to act as a test-case for the rules.</p><p>The court found that Locast’s policy of expanding into new markets runs contrary to the aim of a non-profit, where cash should be used to cover running costs only. Judge Louis Stanton said that the cash raised from Locast’s $5-per-month (don’t call it a) subscription was being used to bankroll further expansion and earned  “far more money from user charges than was necessary.”</p><p>It didn’t help, that when some TV providers have entered into carriage disputes, Locast has been cited as a way of still accessing that content. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/networks-sue-to-stop-streaming-service-offering-free-tv-feeds-11564584062?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=1"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> wrote back in 2019, DirecTV and Dish customers were directed to access Locast, although Dish and AT&amp;T both said that this was only because it felt that it was obliged to offer the choice to its users.</p><p>By removing Locast’s major legal shield, it’s certainly likely that the project will soon have yet more lawyers on their door. After all, were it to survive, it would be a challenge both to the profitability of the major TV players and encouragement to any future upstarts looking to disrupt the space.</p><p>In a statement, Locast said that the ruling was “disappointing,” citing commentary from the EFF adding that the “court interpreted the law in an artificially-narrow way.” The EFF added that “over three million people use Locast to access local TV, including many who can’t afford cable and can’t pick up their local stations with an antenna. This ruling threatens their access to local news and vital information during a global pandemic.” It closed by saying that the ruling “treats copyright law not as an engine of progress but a moat protecting the most privileged position of the four giant broadcasting networks.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/locast-broadcast-lawsuit-copyright-loss-104215298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f64b264f-610e-4c41-8261-0462b6228720</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 10:42:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630492937</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T10:42:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/56b0c390-0b10-11ec-bbbd-fbf17d8a63e8" width="5292" height="3609" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/56b0c390-0b10-11ec-bbbd-fbf17d8a63e8" width="5292" height="3609" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Portland Press Herald via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OLD ORCHARD BEACH, ME - MARCH 5: The over-the-air TV antenna that Pat Brown installed at her Old Orchard Beach home, photographed on Thusday, March 5, 2020.

According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22651304/amazon-alexa-adaptive-volume-noisy-loud-environments"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the new feature called Adaptive Volume will make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alexa-voice-shaq-melissa-mccarthy-103537916.html">Alexa</a> speak louder if it detects a lot of ambient noise. The goal, the company told the publication, is for you to be able to hear the voice assistant&#39;s responses over the noise in your home or office.

Alexa responded in a louder than usual voice at times, but other times it replied in its usual volume. It&#39;s possible that the company is still fine-tuning the feature before making it available in other regions. <em>The Verge </em>has also noted that Amazon didn&#39;t say whether Adaptive Volume can also make the voice assistant respond in a quieter voice if it detects almost no ambient noise. Alexa has long had a &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-18-amazon-alexa-whisper-mode-rolls-out-today.html">whisper mode</a>,&quot; however, which can make it respond in a softer voice when you whisper commands to it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re in the US and want to give Adaptive Volume a try, simply activate it by saying &quot;Alexa, turn on adaptive volume.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alexa-adaptive-volume-074739210.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4875590-d2e1-46b9-900b-56235f966e74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 07:47:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630482486</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T07:48:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bc23ad0-0af1-11ec-bbcf-6e8371dde746" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bc23ad0-0af1-11ec-bbcf-6e8371dde746" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch streamers are taking a day off to protest hate raids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch streamers are planning to step away from the platform on September 1st for a day of protest, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/08/11/twitch-do-better-hate-raids/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> has reported.

CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/extending-our-voluntary-return-office/">told employees</a> the company is delaying the mandatory return to office until January 2022. The current voluntary scheme will last through January 10th. From then on, Google&#39;s offices will make the decisions about when (and if) to make office work mandatory. Staff will be notified 30 days in advance if they&#39;re required to show up.</p><p>The internet pioneer previously hoped to institute a hybrid work week on October 18th, with staff coming in for three out of five days. That, in turn, was later than the originally planned September return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reasoning behind the delay isn&#39;t surprising. The COVID-19 pandemic recovery, and thus the return to offices, has been &quot;longer and bumpier than expected,&quot; according to Pichai. In other words, factors like the virus&#39; Delta variant, vaccination rates and varying case levels have clouded the situation — what works well in one country could be dangerous in another.</p><p>Not that Google will take chances regardless. The company now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">requires full vaccination</a> for any employee returning to the office, voluntary or otherwise. Google might be eager to have people fill its halls, but it also doesn&#39;t want safety issues or skittish employees. It&#39;s not alone, either — fellow tech firms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html">like Apple</a> have delayed their own return-to-office plans as the pandemic&#39;s realities become clearer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-voluntary-return-to-office-plan-204850097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4427ca64-d7c7-4f99-ab05-9ff6adf09ce0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 20:48:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630440959</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T20:16:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Samsung is <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users">rolling out</a> a One UI 3.1.1 update that brings many of those phones&#39; multitasking and app resizing features to the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">Fold</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">Fold 2</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Flip</a> and Flip 5G.</p><p>The Fold line unsurprisingly benefits the most thanks to its larger, tablet-like screen. Features like Multi-Active Window (up to three apps at once) and App Split View (seeing extra content for an app) make that folding display much more useful. You can also force apps to resize and rotate on your Fold, pin your favorites with the Taskbar and mirror your internal display on the cover screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not that Flip owners are out of luck. Drag &amp; Split lets all Samsung foldable owners create a new window for an already-open app, and you can invoke Flex Mode to bring up media controls when the phone is partially folded.</p><p>Most of these features are deploying now, although you&#39;ll have to wait an extra week if you&#39;re using the first Galaxy Fold. Not that you&#39;ll likely mind. This could significantly improve the usefulness of your older foldable, and suggests Samsung is eager to earn the loyalty of early adopters — if just to increase the chances that you&#39;ll buy another Fold or Flip when you&#39;re due for an upgrade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-3-1-1-galaxy-z-fold-2-185330625.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52a096ef-ddf6-4c82-bef9-c9372c55478d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:53:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630435496</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T18:45:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
