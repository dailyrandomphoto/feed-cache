While Unjected bills itself as a place to find others who support &quot;medical autonomy and free speech,&quot; social posts on the site have included false claims that vaccines modify genes, connect to 5G and serve as &quot;bioweapons.&quot;</p><p>The app founders are also embroiled in a fight over their Android app. Google told Unjected on July 16th that it had two weeks to remove the misleading posts from its app to avoid a Play Store ban. The developers responded by pulling the social feed. However, co-creator Shelby Thompson said Unjected planned to defy the request by restoring both the feed and the offending posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple and Google for comment. Unjected still has a presence on Instagram despite that social network&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rfk-jr-kicked-off-instagram-171539088.html">anti-misinformation stance</a>, although that account mostly promotes its views on &quot;freedom&quot; and only occasionally mentions falsehoods, such as incorrect claims that mRNA vaccines alter DNA. We&#39;ve asked Facebook for a response as well.</p><p>Unjected is small compared to mainstream social networks, with roughly 18,000 app downloads (according to Apptopia). However, the crackdown clearly serves as a warning — Apple and Google won&#39;t tolerate apps that knowingly accept and encourage the creation anti-vax content, even if they aren&#39;t directly producing that material.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-unjected-anti-vax-app-172231369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3ddc147-4e94-4f95-ac97-8a5ce3654b07</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 17:22:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627752154</ingested><modified>2021-07-31T17:22:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/2e05ce90-be6c-11eb-8fb5-642cfc0fd443" width="7825" height="5219" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/2e05ce90-be6c-11eb-8fb5-642cfc0fd443" width="7825" height="5219" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Morsa Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A healthcare Worker hands in surgical gloves pulling COVID-19 vaccine liquid from vial to vaccinate a patient]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Healthcare Worker Prepares a Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DOJ: Hackers behind SolarWinds attacks targeted federal prosecutors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The perpetrators of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-russia-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-microsoft-china-165525103.html">SolarWinds hacks</a> apparently targeted key parts of the American legal system. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-europe-russia-election-2020-5486323e455277b39cd3283d70a7fd64">According</a> to the <em>AP,</em> the Justice Department says hackers targeted federal prosecutors between May 2020 and December 2020.

From the afternoon in December 1966 that he first tried out the Manned Maneuvering Unit in a Martin Marietta simulator, he was hooked on a vision of a gas-propelled jetpack that would allow astronauts to operate outside their spacecraft. This vision had an obvious pop-culture antecedent. In the 1920s a comic-strip character named Buck Rogers — a rock-jawed, All-American World War I veteran — succumbed to the effects of a mysterious gas he encountered while working as a mine inspector. He fell into a deep sleep and woke after five centuries of slumber to a strange new world of spaceships, ray guns, and Asian over-lords. Though he initially traveled this new world via an antigravity belt, a device that allowed him and his best gal, Wilma, to leap great distances at a time, Buck eventually acquired a svelte and evidently omnidirectional jetpack. He eventually ventured into space in an adventure called <em>Tiger Men from Mars</em>, and his exploits in the cosmos changed America’s vision of the future forever. Millions followed Buck’s adventures in the funnies, on radio, and in movie serials. Among Buck’s imitators and spiritual heirs are Flash Gordon, Brick Bradford, John Carter of Mars, and Han Solo.</p><p>A host of talented men and women spent significant amounts of time and money to wrestle that jetpack out of the funny papers and into the space shuttle. None worked harder, though, than Bruce McCandless and his chief collaborator, an Auburn-educated engineer and Air Force officer named Charles Edward (“Ed”) Whitsett, Jr. Whitsett was a pale, bespectacled individual, mild-mannered but tenacious. He had a head start on my father. He’d been thinking and writing about jetpack technology as early as 1962. In a sense, he was trying to solve a problem that didn’t exist yet: Namely, how could an astronaut venture outside his or her spaceship and perform constructive tasks in an environment with no oxygen, with extreme temperature fluctuations, and in an orbital “free fall” that would leave the spacefarer lolling in the practical equivalent of zero gravity? Alexei Leonov of the Soviet Union and American Ed White had proven that extravehicular activity was possible, that men could survive outside of their space capsule, but basically all they’d done was float. How could a man move from one part of a spaceship to another, or from one spacecraft to another craft, or from a spacecraft to a satellite, in order to make inspections or repairs? None of these needs really existed in the early sixties, when the programs of both nations were still just trying to fire tin cans into low Earth orbit and predict, more or less, where they would come back down. But clearly the needs would eventually arise, and various methods were proposed to address them.</p><p>In the mid-sixties, the Air Force assigned Whitsett to NASA to supervise development of the Air Force’s Astronaut Maneuvering Unit. Gene Cernan’s failed test flight of the AMU on Gemini 9 in 1966 — the “space-walk from hell,” as Cernan called it — set the jetpack project back, but it never went away. McCandless, Whitsett, and a NASA engineer named Dave Schultz worked quietly but assiduously to keep the dream alive. They enlarged and improved the AMU all through the latter half of the decade and into the seventies. In the “Forgotten Astronauts” wire story that portrayed him as a washout in 1973, my dad mentioned the reason why he wanted to stay in the manned space program despite not having won a crew assignment on either Apollo or Skylab. “McCandless,” said the article, “has helped develop the M509 experimental maneuvering unit. The Skylab astronauts strap it on like a backpack and propel themselves Buck Rogers — like around the Skylab interior. [He] wants to build a larger operational unit to perform space chores outside the shuttle.” And that’s exactly what he did.</p><p>Though the Skylab M509 tests in 1973 and 1974 were a resounding success, resulting in the triumph of the jetpack concept over both rocket boots and the handheld maneuvering unit, Whitsett and McCandless didn’t rest on their laurels. Over the next several years, using whatever time and funding they could scrape together, the team made multiple upgrades — eleven, by one count — to what was now being called the “manned maneuvering unit,” or MMU. The bulbous nitrogen-gas fuel tank of the ASMU was replaced with two streamlined aluminum tanks in the rear of the unit, each of which was wrapped in Kevlar. The number of propulsion nozzles was increased from fourteen to twenty-four, positioned around the jetpack to allow for six-degrees-of-freedom precision maneuvering. Smaller gyroscopes replaced those used on the ASMU, and, as space historian Andrew Chaikin has noted, the ASMU’s “pistol-grip hand controllers, which were tiring to operate in pressurized space suit gloves, were replaced by small T-handles that needed just a nudge of the fingertips.” The MMU’s new arm units were made to be adjustable, to accommodate astronauts of all sizes. Painted white for maximum reflectivity, the unit was built to survive the 500-degree fluctuation in temperatures (from a high of 250 degrees F to a low of minus 250 F!) that an astronaut might encounter in space.</p><p>By 1980 the machine weighed in at 326 pounds. Like the AMU and the ASMU before it, the MMU was designed to fit with or “over” the astronaut’s pressure suit. Shuttle astronauts wore a newly designed suit called the Extravehicular Maneuvering Unit, or EMU, a two-piece marvel of textile engineering made up of fourteen layers of Nylon ripstop, Gore-Tex, Kevlar, Mylar, and other substances. Power for the jetpack’s electronics was supplied by two 16.8-volt silver-zinc batteries. Two motion-control handles — the translational hand controller and the rotational hand controller — were mounted on the unit’s left and right armrests, respectively, and a button activated an “attitude-hold mode,” which used motion-sensing gyroscopes to direct the firing of the thrusters to maintain an astronaut’s position in space.</p><p>The machine had been tested in every way its designers could imagine. A representative of a local gun club visited Martin Marietta and shot the MMU’s nitrogen fuel tank with a .50 caliber bullet to ascertain whether the tank would explode if pierced. (It didn&#39;t.) The jetpack was run through hundreds of hours of simulations. At my father’s urging, a gifted and intense Martin Marietta project manager named Bill Bollendonk subjected the device to space-like conditions in the company’s thermal vacuum facility. The MMU was no longer a “far out” experiment, as Mike Collins once called it. It was now a promising space tool. Unfortunately, for the moment, it was still an unused space tool. American astronauts remained on Earth, as NASA struggled to produce its next-generation orbital workhorse, the space shuttle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-wonders-all-around-bruce-mc-candless-iii-green-leaf-book-group-153027314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49668cb9-798a-46b4-8cca-bf5dde2026d5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627578020</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T17:00:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2bb5450-efea-11eb-bfff-89891a0602ee" width="1600" height="901" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92f1e6b0-efe8-11eb-acfd-bd2e5c0bdf03" width="1366" height="768" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telegram's video calls can now accommodate up to 1,000 viewers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Telegram has <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000">expanded</a> the group video calling feature it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-group-video-calls-mobile-desktop-tablet-150020126.html">launched</a> in June to be able to accommodate more participants — a <em>lot</em> more.

On Friday, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=gaolegal">watchdog said</a> NASA’s “evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement’s terms.”</p><p>When Blue Origin first challenged the lunar lander contract in April, the company claimed the selection process was “fundamentally unfair” because it didn’t get a chance to revise its bid. To that point, NASA could afford to give SpaceX the contract because the company agreed to modify its payment schedule. Blue Origin also took issue with the fact that the space agency selected a single contractor for the project when the initial announcement had called for two manufacturers to be involved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In reviewing NASA’s decision, the GAO says the space agency “did not violate procurement law or regulation when it decided to make only one award.” It notes NASA gave itself the flexibility to hand out a single contract, multiple awards or none at all when it first announced the Human Landing System program.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the GAO concluded there “was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement” due to the amount of funding it had available for the project. Notably, the GAO also points in its press release that its role is not to judge the relative merits of a contract decision. Both Blue Origin and Dynetics had argued that NASA chose the most “high risk option available” since SpaceX’s bid involved its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-155125322.html">Starship rocket</a>, which at that point in the procurement process had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sn15-223714843.html">yet to land in one piece</a>.</p><p>&quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction. We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin said following the decision. &quot;We’ve been encouraged by actions in Congress to add a second provider and appropriate additional resources to NASA&#39;s pursuit to return Americans to the Moon. We’re also very encouraged by Administrator Nelson’s comments over the past week that reaffirm NASA’s original intent to provide simultaneous competition. The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later — that&#39;s the best solution for NASA and the best solution for our country.”</p><p>The decision comes mere days after Blue Origin founder and former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered to waive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">$2 billion</a> in payments from NASA in return for a lunar lander contract. Following Blue Origin’s protest, NASA told SpaceX to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">stop work on the Human Landing System</a> while the GAO sorted out the challenge. Today&#39;s decision allows the project and the Artemis program more broadly to move forward unless Blue Origin asks the US Court of Federal Claims to examine the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 2:28PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Blue Origin.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3de23178-bae2-4941-81a3-940c2bb9e56d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:10:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627670859</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T18:47:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7f21eca0-f166-11eb-9ffd-0b231b2e0ae9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7f21eca0-f166-11eb-9ffd-0b231b2e0ae9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clodagh Kilcoyne / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bezos on stage at a Blue Origin event.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SPACE-EXPLORATION/BEZOS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This toe tickling navigation system will help the visually impaired walk tall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the death of a sight-impaired relative, Wataru Chino had no choice but to take action. In response to the tragedy, the Honda EV engineer developed an in-shoe navigation system, dubbed Ashirase (both the name of the product and the name of the company) that allows low-sighted people to use their feet to navigate, rather than cell phones or other visual aids. The tactile navigation system has earned the financial backing of Honda’s Ignition startup incubator program and continues to gain traction.</p><p>The Ashirase system is two-part, consisting of the dedicated Ashirase navigation app running on the user’s smartphone and a silicone shoe insert cradling a combination motion sensor-electronic compass. Once the user programs their walking destination into the app, the shoe inserts will vibrate in various patterns and tempos — “walk forward” causes vibrations under the balls of the feet, “turn left” rubs the appropriate side of both feet and the speed at which the inserts vibrate indicate proximity to the turn or obstacle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea behind the system is to allow users to remain more aware of their surroundings while they walk, using their feet to navigate rather than repeatedly stopping to consult their smartphones or passersby for directions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26270060-f150-11eb-bfb1-49fd28a7bcd4" style="height:1059;width:1600;" alt="Ashirase" data-uuid="5eb0328c-9d91-3a42-b42b-e3766a9c2d3f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ashirase</div></figure><p>Currently the insert prototypes can only be used in low top sneakers and dress shoes but Chino already has plans to expand the footwear selection. “We are thinking about [new footwear styles], and the idea is twofold at this moment,” Chino told Engadget through an interpreter. “One is to try to change, modifying the [electronic] device so that the shape can be fitted to other types of shoes.”</p><p>“Otherwise,” he continued, “what we can do is to change the yellow parts of this device so that it fits other types of shoes” noting that the white “puck”part can be disconnected from the flexible yellow insert that sits around the wearer’s foot and houses the various vibrating navigation gyroscopes. The system has a reported week-long battery life when using the system to navigate an average of three hours a day. Initially, the insert will be offered in generic small, medium and large sizes in Japan but he plans to offer more personalized fittings once the product hits market.</p><p>The navigation system is currently a bit limited, based on the Google Maps API rather than an HD map source, in that it will work so long as a navigation data signal is available. That means that the system may not initially work in indoor areas like malls or hotels — though hiking trails, parks and other public lands should be no problem.</p><p>Chino and his team are reportedly looking into incorporating either a Personal Dead-reckoning (PDR) system, Wi-Fi-based positioning or IoT navigation capability to help users make their ways through indoor public spaces at a later date. The team also reportedly plans to add public transportation options to the program in the future.</p><p>The company plans to release a beta version of the Ashirase system in Japan in October or November of this year. Users will be given free use of the insert and app for one week before being asked for feedback. Following the public beta, Ashirase executives expect the commercialized product to be ready by October 2022 and include a 2,000 - 3,000 yen ($18 - $27) monthly subscription.</p><p>Before that can happen, however, the startup is seeking some 200 million yen in additional funding — not including the 70 million yen in equity the Ignition program already provided — in order to scale up to full production.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/this-toe-tickling-navigation-system-will-help-the-visually-impaired-walk-tall-170058461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb81719c-7c23-4e4b-8dfc-48538571f245</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627662309</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T16:25:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac3329a0-f0f5-11eb-bff7-0b4b4ecf4732" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac3329a0-f0f5-11eb-bff7-0b4b4ecf4732" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ashirase LLC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ashirase in-shoe navigation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ashirase in-shoe navigation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's Noteable Releases playlist showcases the songwriters behind popular music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the better part of its recent history, Spotify’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-20-spotify-discover-weekly-playlist.html">Discover Weekly</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-05-spotifys-release-radar-playlist-new-music.html">Release Radar playlists</a> have been the company’s go-to way to help people discover new music.

The New Wave movement might have been little more than a ripple, Synth Pop may have never happened and, in a roundabout way, Calvin Harris might never have known <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOkQ4T5WO9E">what we came for</a>.</p><p>But Numan <em>did </em>hear that all-important sound, the one that lit up his brain and switched him on to technology as a music-making tool, paving the way for electronic music to go mainstream. That’s just one of many accidentally influential moments to be found in <em>Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson</em> — a documentary jaunt through the cornerstones of music technology that’s streaming now on Apple TV+.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ronson is, perhaps, best known for his work with Amy Winehouse — a decidedly analog, brassy affair. But his love of technology is abundantly clear as <em>Watch the Sound</em> serves up easily digestible bites of musical history around key technological themes: Sampling, drum machines, synths and beyond. Along the way, Ronson casually drops in on such luminaries as Paul McCartney, Quest Love and the aforementioned Numan, along with contemporary artists such as Charlie XCX and King Princess. If the series doesn’t inspire you to google around for a MIDI controller by the end of it then nothing ever will.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2ce426d0-f141-11eb-93eb-c2847fcbb39d" alt="Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson." data-uuid="74e3cd1a-98cf-3d19-9392-7cc9d841667b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple TV+</div></figure><p>Unlike Netflix’s fast-paced <em>This is Pop</em>, <em>Watch the Sound</em> leans more histrionic. Each episode starts with Ronson recounting his own first experience with whatever this episode is about (a sampler, distorted guitars and so on). He then spends time with artists that popularized that sound, asking pensive questions and generally nerding out about music as only someone with Ronson’s wide palette of influences really can.</p><p>This sense of a journey through Ronson’s musical interests gives <em>Watch the Sound</em> a more intimate feel than <em>This is Pop</em>’s more talking heads approach. “I think what&#39;s important is that there is a familiarity between the episodes, there is a kind of a guiding force. And that was always going to be Mark&#39;s personal experience,” executive producer Mark Monroe told Engadget.</p><p>This sense of “experience” is perhaps no more apparent when Ronson spends time with Sean Ono Lennon. Lennon talks candidly about his father’s own struggle with the sound of his voice. He then adroitly reinvents a recording of Lennon senior with Harmony Engine (that Ronson describes as “autotune on steroids”) in what turns out to be a surprisingly tender moment. Lennon junior is visibly moved by this brief yet intimate musical encounter.</p><div id="787f06283be546a3aea104dd5ee80768"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/rO4pM0v" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Of course, the show is about the machines as much as the people that made them important. Watching DJ Premier’s absolute mastery of the MPC, for example, is as impressive as it is frustrating (at least to anyone else who’s had a go on one and could barely peck out a beat). Later on, watching Ronson take a box cutter to a speaker cone with David Grohl feels like it should have been an outtake until... goddammit, why is he somehow good at everything? (You’ll have to watch it to find out why they did this.)</p><p>Other humorous moments are, perhaps, less intentional. Ronson at one point finds himself in a full miner’s jumpsuit, and he’s never looked so uncomfortable. In episode one, we enjoy a rare, albeit slight crack in his golden touch as he struggles to make anything remotely musical with autotune (he rectifies that later, naturally).</p><p>If there were an enduring message in <em>Watch the Sound</em> (and many other series of its ilk) it’s that perfection and talent are rarely what creates something magical. Most of the technology featured was either misused, misunderstood or reappropriated through necessity. Legends were born thereof and this is just how we do things now.</p><p>It’s refreshing, if not invigorating to know that you don’t have to aspire to perfect pitch or even really have any formal musical training to be a pioneer. In fact, it’s easy to convince yourself that knowing your scales might even hold you back sometimes if you find yourself trying to only play by the rules.</p><p>This sentiment is solidified in the episode about synthesizers. Here, the cast of heroes is more at home with an oscilloscope than with an oboe. The band of misfits (and, let history show, many, many more women than are ever given credit) effectively reinvented what music could be from the ground up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3955f6d0-f143-11eb-be7f-9259c7abf5f5" alt="Watch the Sound with Mark Ronson." data-uuid="c891b547-0024-3f6e-8f7c-4169808c0e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple TV+</div></figure><p>Monroe said that was something that became apparent during filming, too. “Digging into synthesizer and really kind of understanding what a disruptor it was … what an opportunity for the people on the outside of the music business … and not just to gain a foothold, but to become, you know, legendary.”</p><p>Even if you don’t have an interest in how music is made, the show will have you jotting down the names of bands and songs you want to explore further and delight you with a sense of possibility. Or in my case, vindication. The episode on sampling recounts the abhorrent push-back that this new technology received. “That’s not real music” someone remembers being told.

The limits were due to expire in August and kept fees no higher than 15 percent for deliveries, plus 5 percent for other services. Apps could have charged up to 35 percent without the fee ceiling.</p><p>Queens Council Member Francisco Moya claimed a return to higher fees would &quot;completely&quot; hobble businesses just starting to recover from the pandemic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other bills passed at the same time require apps to get written approval before listing businesses and to share customer data with restaurants. Delivery services have faced criticism, <a href="https://www.eater.com/21537215/restaurants-sue-third-party-delivery-service-grubhub-for-listing-businesses-without-permission">lawsuits</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/grubhubdrivers/comments/ksh1gm/its_now_illegal_for_delivery_apps_to_list/">legislation</a> after listing restaurants in their apps without permission.</p><p>The app creators have opposed New York City&#39;s new measures. GrubHub claimed the caps were &quot;arbitrary price controls&quot; that would allegedly damage businesses and the economy. DoorDash, meanwhile, suggested that data sharing with restaurants should be opt-in rather than enabled by default. The company was determined to &quot;protect the privacy&quot; of users, a spokesperson said.</p><p>The companies haven&#39;t been completely opposed to reduced fees. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-cutting-restaurant-fees-in-half-130002696.html">DoorDash</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-17-doordash-reduces-commission-fees.html">GrubHub</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-uber-eats-waives-delivery-fees-independent-restaurants.html">Uber Eats</a> and others started cutting and waiving some fees as the pandemic began. Their concern, as you might guess, is that these caps might become permanent and restrict the apps&#39; long-term viability. It&#39;s not an unfounded fear — San Francisco&#39;s Board of Supervisors <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/food-policy-snapshot-san-francisco-delivery-app-commission-fee-cap/">recently voted</a> to permanently cap delivery app fees in the city.</p><p>At the same time, there&#39;s little doubt that restaurants are eager to avoid a return to pre-pandemic fees. Some eateries were only reluctantly listing themselves in these apps due to the large fees, and in many cases have <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/27/business/restaurant-delivery-alternatives/index.html">offered</a> incentives to customers who order directly. While NYC&#39;s extension won&#39;t necessarily ensure a given restaurant&#39;s survival, it could help that restaurant maintain familiar profits or keep prices in check.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-food-delivery-caps-extended-145712985.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3047620-284d-4462-8d35-e0395f68322e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 14:57:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627657036</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T14:57:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96894650-f13d-11eb-bbbe-352aaaa5c947" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96894650-f13d-11eb-bbbe-352aaaa5c947" width="10320" height="6880" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Christine McCann via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York, NY, USA - August 23, 2020: A Grubhub food delivery man rides south down Lexington Avenue on Manhattan's upper east side in the east 90's on a quiet Sunday in August.

The CNPD fined the company €746 million ($888 million) on July 16th for violating the bloc&#39;s strict data privacy laws, known as GDPR. Amazon disclosed the ruling in an <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001018724/cbae1abf-eddb-4451-9186-6753b02cc4eb.pdf">SEC filing</a> on Friday in which it slammed the decision as baseless, adding that it intended to defend itself &quot;vigorously in this matter.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>“There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party,” Amazon told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/amazon-given-record-888-million-eu-fine-for-data-privacy-breach?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “These facts are undisputed. We strongly disagree with the CNPD’s ruling.” It added that it plans to appeal the decision. Amazon has its EU headquarters in Luxembourg, tasking the local data regulator with overseeing its compliance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The penalty is the result of a 2018 complaint by French privacy rights group La Quadrature du Net, which filed numerous <a href="https://www.laquadrature.net/en/personnal-data/">lawsuits</a> against Big Tech companies on the behalf of 12,000 people shortly after the GDPR was established that year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among those was a case involving Google&#39;s Android operating system that led to France&#39;s CNIL regulator slapping the search giant with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-france-fines-google-over-gdpr.html">$57 million fine</a> in January, 2019 — the biggest GDPR fine to date. The watchdog ruled that the company had violated the GDPR due to its failure to obtain legal consent for data collection related to its ad targeting practices.</p><p>The record penalty comes amid heightened scrutiny of Amazon&#39;s business in Europe. Its use of data is also at the heart of the EU&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-amazon-antitrust-third-party-data-114513778.html">antitrust investigation</a>. Following a year-long probe, officials in November reached a preliminary decision that Amazon had breached competition rules by using third-party seller data to boost its own products. At the same time, they launched a second investigation into its alleged preferential treatment of its own products on its site and those of its partners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fine-eu-data-privacy-130443268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0665f444-43af-434d-8d80-bbf2be34bf2e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 13:04:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627650287</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T13:04:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/47b9e9a0-9093-11ea-affb-c3580aa7bb62" width="3500" height="1888" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/47b9e9a0-9093-11ea-affb-c3580aa7bb62" width="3500" height="1888" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tobias Schwarz / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A worker stands his designated workspace at a packing station as he supervises items for delivery from the 70,000 square metre warehouse floor at Amazon's new distribution center in Brieselang, near Berlin November 28, 2013.

These objects — called 203 Pompeja and 269 Justitia — are redder than the reddest known objects in the asteroid belt and may have migrated to the area from beyond Neptune. If that&#39;s true, then they could provide insight into the chaos of the early solar system and into how the solar system as we know it today came to be.</p><p>The team led by JAXA&#39;s Sunao Hasegawa identified the objects through observations collected at the Infra-red Telescope Facility and Seoul National University Astronomical Observatory, according to the paper they published. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/science/red-asteroids-belt.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> points out, most objects in the inner solar system tend to reflect blue light, because they&#39;re devoid of or have very little organic materials. Objects from the outer solar system such as the Kuiper belt, however, tend to be redder. That&#39;s because they have a lot of organics like carbon and methane, which may have been the building blocks of our planet. As you may know, the Kuiper belt is the region extending from the orbit of Neptune where you can find remnants of our solar system&#39;s formation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Pompeja and Justitia truly were transplants from beyond Nepture, then they&#39;d serve as evidence for the hypothesis that a fraction of the asteroids between Jupiter and Mars came from the Kuiper belt. They&#39;d also support the set of theories, called the Nice Model, on how our gas giants settled into their orbits. The Nice model says our giant planets formed closer to the Sun until an instability forced Neptune, Uranus and Saturn to move outwards and Jupiter to move inwards. The event would&#39;ve caused asteroids rich in organic materials to scatter and move around the solar system.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, more observations and evidence are needed to be able to prove that the two objects are from the Kuiper belt. The good thing is that since the asteroid belt is much closer to us than Neptune, it would take a spacecraft less time to reach them if ever Earth&#39;s space agencies decide to send a probe to study them more closely.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/two-red-objects-asteroid-belt-115517310.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">817038fb-6d91-4e9d-bbaa-1112a0a243c2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 11:55:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627644533</ingested><modified>2021-07-31T16:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8dea740-f11e-11eb-abde-d2e93093e9e4" width="3686" height="2052" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8dea740-f11e-11eb-abde-d2e93093e9e4" width="3686" height="2052" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[brunorbs via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Asteroid belt in outer space]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Asteroid belt 3D CGI Render in space, stars and sun flares in the background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Doctor Who' needs to evolve to survive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The BBC has announced that Chris Chibnall (pictured, center), Doctor Who’s executive producer, and its star, Jodie Whittaker (pictured, right), will <a href="https://www.doctorwho.tv/news/?article=jodie-whittaker-chris-chibnall-leave-doctor-who"><ins>leave the series in 2022</ins></a>. A trio of specials through next year would herald the pair’s departure from the long-running series. This, then, seems like an ideal time for Doctor Who to undergo the radical shakeup it so desperately needs.  I don’t agree with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2021/jul/20/exterminate-exterminate-why-its-time-for-doctor-who-to-die"><em><ins>The Guardian’s</ins></em></a> recent piece saying that the series needs to be off the air for a while, but it is very clearly time for the show to evolve again.</p><p>This is in part because Doctor Who under Chibnall has been such a waste: the showrunner’s work before taking the job, while popular and award-winning, had always left me cold. My initial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-26-chris-chibnall-doctor-who.html"><ins>apprehension</ins></a> was calmed, somewhat, by the news emerging from the production of the revived series’ 11th run. Chibnall also deserves credit for hiring the first two writers of color in the show’s nearly <em>sixty year</em> history. The fact that many of the episodes had an explicit focus on material social history suggested a bright new direction for the series. <em>The Woman Who Fell To Earth</em>, too, was a blisteringly confident debut and all seemed well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And then, <em>yeesh</em>. As good as Chibnall is at birthing some truly inspired ideas, the quality of his execution is terrible. He struggled to flesh out the quartet of lead characters and failed to offer them real stakes to deal with. And for all of the era’s emphasis on diversity, the content of each episode seemed to be far more backward-looking. I’ve written <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-14-doctor-who-spyfall-big-tech.html"><ins>before</ins></a> about Chibnall often appearing to make the argument opposite to the one he thinks he’s making. Unless he <em>intended</em> to say that polite protest is the only good protest, Amazon’s treatment of its staff is good, actually, and that we can all benefit from the spoils of colonialism.</p><p>Naturally, the casting of a woman in the central role encouraged the usual petulance from <em>those</em> corners of the internet. Sadly, I think that the actors involved have all performed miracles trying to make anything Chibnall writes remotely believable. And Whittaker’s departure before she could work with another executive producer will be yet another tragically wasted opportunity in this era. I hope that this bad-faith criticism doesn&#39;t force the production team to make a “safe” choice for the next Doctor.</p><p>The big secret to <em>Doctor Who’s</em> endurance is both the malleability of its premise and its knack for reinventing itself. Every few years, often as the show’s creative team changed, it would become an almost entirely different show. You could argue that this lack of sentimentality has been the case since the show’s first mission-switch, which happened in its <em>fifth</em> episode. The revived show has been using a version of the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> template since 2005, and it’s starting to wear a bit thin.</p><p>It didn’t help that while Series 11 was designed to avoid any of the show’s dense backstory, Series 12 was at times incomprehensible to anyone but die hard fans. Chibnall, after all, devoted his series arc to validating a production gaffe in an episode that aired on January 24th, <em>1976</em>. (And, in doing so, made the Doctor the Time Lord equivalent of Jesus, contradicting everything that we’d learned over the last six decades.) This was the worst kind of self-indulgent fan fiction, and hardly a bold new direction for a mainstream drama.</p><p>Unfortunately, the media landscape has changed, and competition has intensified beyond all belief. The BBC no longer has a monopoly on the conversation as it did — at least here in the UK — and is dwarfed by the streaming giants. Netflix, Amazon, Disney and others also have the wealth to offer the sort of creative freedom that once made the non-commercial BBC stand out among the crowd.</p><p>The knee-jerk reaction, I’m sure, will be to demand Doctor Who jumps on the bandwagon driven by Marvel’s recent streaming shows. That would be a mistake, because Who is at its best when it pushes away from whatever genre show is cresting into the mainstream that year. Financially, the BBC can’t compete with these mega-franchises, but the quality of its writing and its unique sensibilities, can. The one thing that the series could learn from those shows, however, is how to build every episode into an <em>event</em>.</p><p>This could mean that the show becomes a run of occasional specials with a longer running time, like a glorified movie of the week. Or it could, like the COVID-influenced 2021 season, be a shorter run of tightly-interconnected episodes. Chibnall may indeed stumble onto the template that helps revitalize the show going forward, but I’m personally hoping for something more radical.</p><p>For instance, if Doctor Who can’t succeed as a glossy, hour-long standalone drama, then why not go back to being a series of short serials? Netflix’s <em>Russian Doll</em> and the BBC’s<em> I May Destroy You</em> are both examples of (excellent) half-hour dramas that offer a break from the current prestige-drama template. It helps, too, that <em>Doctor Who</em> was run in this format for 25 of its first 26 seasons, and offers new — or at <em>least different</em> — methods for structuring a story.</p><p>It may also make it easier to binge during its long second life on a streaming platform. Think about it: how many times have you ducked watching a long episode of <em>The Crown</em> because it’s too much time to invest out of your day, but you’ll happily burn through four episodes of <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em> without complaint. You could even get Michaela Coel to write it, although at this point I’ll settle for anyone who isn’t named Chris Chibnall.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/doctor-who-chibnall-whittaker-departure-reformat-series-113012792.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d897381a-78e4-435a-b3e9-6d4c2ac7d851</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 11:30:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627642885</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T11:01:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/920d1000-f11c-11eb-bfff-8f13a14dac72" width="3400" height="2413" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/920d1000-f11c-11eb-bfff-8f13a14dac72" width="3400" height="2413" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gary Gershoff via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 05:  (L-R) Producer Matt Strevens, writer Chris Chibnall and actress Jodie Whittaker visit Build Series to discuss the series 'Doctor Who' at Build Studio on October 5, 2018 in New York City.

It’s a whole lot more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-ssd-upgrade-beta-software-130741800.html">complicated</a> than plugging in a USB drive, however.

As part of the pact, the site will provide energy stability by unlocking an additional 250 MW of peak capacity on the existing Victoria to New South Wales Interconnector over the next decade of Australian summers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-megapack-fire-victorian-big-battery-105535797.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92b888ce-b5c1-4ea3-8f3f-4af45e3b384a</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 10:55:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627650399</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T13:06:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/598e5970-f124-11eb-a77f-dc6474f5a68a" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/598e5970-f124-11eb-a77f-dc6474f5a68a" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Victorian Big Battery]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA and Boeing delay Starliner ISS launch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Boeing Starliner&#39;s trip to the International Space Station has hit another hurdle. The craft was scheduled for a second uncrewed test flight to the ISS today, July 30th, after its first attempt went <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-20-boeing-starliner-nasa-uncrewed-test-flight.html">awry</a> back in late 2019. But, it will have to wait a bit longer for take off. NASA and Boeing have decided to <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/author/aagriffi/">push back</a> the launch to the tentative date of Tuesday, August 3rd.&nbsp;</p><p>The delay comes after the thrusters on the ISS&#39; new Russian module Nauka accidentally activated causing the station to move out of orientation. Though ground teams managed to regain control and motion of the ISS, NASA is proceeding with caution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The International Space Station team will use the time to continue working checkouts of the newly arrived Roscosmos Nauka multipurpose laboratory module and to ensure the station will be ready for Starliner’s arrival,&quot; the agency said in a statement.</p><p>The completion of the second test flight is a critical part of the Starliner&#39;s development phase that will be followed by the first of six crew rotation missions. NASA added that launch preparations would resume pending a final decision from the ISS and Commercial Crew Program teams.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, staff are assessing whether to move the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket — atop which the Starliner is placed — from the launch pad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station back to the Vehicle Integration Facility. While both are mission-ready, the move is seen as a mitigation measure to protect them from weather damage.</p><p>The delay is the latest in a series of setbacks that have thus far prevented the Starliner from reaching the ISS. In December 2019, the Boeing craft suffered an automation issue during its first test flight that caused it to miss its planned orbit. While the second test flight has been held up since late last year due to <a href="https://starlinerupdates.com/nasa-and-boeing-target-new-launch-date-for-next-starliner-flight-test/">ongoing</a> software checks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-boeing-delay-starliner-iss-launch-092458695.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6f92273-1476-47f5-9838-d9e024e4c402</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:24:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627637102</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T09:25:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f756f310-f115-11eb-b6f3-e2c86946a2c5" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f756f310-f115-11eb-b6f3-e2c86946a2c5" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CAPE CANAVERAL, FL - JULY 29: In this NASA handout, A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with Boeings CST-100 Starliner spacecraft onboard is seen as it is rolled out of the Vertical Integration Facility to the launch pad at Space Launch Complex 41 ahead of the Orbital Flight Test-2 (OFT-2) mission, Thursday, July 29, 2021 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.

As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/30/tesla-owners-could-get-625-each-in-settlement-over-battery-throttling.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes, it said at the time that the update will revise &quot;charge and thermal management settings&quot; on Model S and Model X vehicles to &quot;help further protect the battery and improve battery longevity.&quot; Some Model S owners claimed, however, that the update reduced their maximum battery voltage, prompting them to take Tesla to court. Now, the automaker has agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle the class action lawsuit filed against it.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-agrees-pay-15-mln-settle-claims-over-temporary-battery-voltage-reduction-2021-07-29/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the court documents show that the software update affected 1,743 Model S sedans in the US. The voltage limitation was temporary, but the plaintiffs experienced a 10 percent battery reduction for three months and a seven percent reduction lasting for another seven months, the plaintiffs&#39; lawyers said. Tesla rolled out the final update that fully corrected the issue in March 2020. Among the affected vehicles, 1,552 had their max battery voltage restored, while 57 vehicles had battery replacements. The settlement documents said that any vehicle still experiencing battery throttling problems would have their maximum voltage restored over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company has agreed to pay $1.5 million, a huge chunk of that would be used to cover lawyers&#39; fees: Owners are expected to get only $625 each from the settlement. Affected owners in Norway could get a much bigger payday after a court in the country ordered the company to pay them $16,000 each to settle a lawsuit over the same issue. In the US, aside from agreeing to pay up, Tesla has also agreed to provide battery-related diagnostics and notifications for cars under warranty whenever battery repairs may be needed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-settle-model-s-battery-throttling-complaints-080705951.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80f56564-f69d-4bd8-ad2b-6c1b9f4f4261</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 08:07:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627641152</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T10:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5982eac0-f103-11eb-b56f-abc2b9ff8b6b" width="1600" height="999" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dish Network is finally offering HBO, Cinemax and HBO Max to its subscribers after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-hbo-dish-att.html">kicking HBO off its network</a> nearly three years ago. It&#39;s the first time Dish subscribers will be able to watch HBO shows like <em>Mare of Easttown</em> and <em>Euphoria</em> since the carriage dispute began on October 31st, 2018. However, the new agreement doesn&#39;t cover Dish subsidiary Sling TV&#39;s distribution of HBO or HBO Max.&nbsp;</p><p>When Dish removed HBO and Cinemax channels, it accused then-parent  AT&amp;T of using HBO as an &quot;economic weapon.&quot; At that time, HBO was only a straight cable station, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-hbo-max.html">AT&amp;T launched HBO Max</a> as a Netflix-like streaming service in July of 2019. With the situation now resolved, Dish becomes the last major pay TV distributor to add HBO Max to its lineup.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The resolution follows a major shakeup with HBO&#39;s parent, WarnerMedia. In May 2021, AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/warnermedia_discovery.html">announced</a> that it was spinning off that division and merging it with Discovery in a $43 billion deal. That effectively removed a conflict of interest as AT&amp;T is a direct competitor to Dish in the satellite video service provider space. The parties haven&#39;t disclosed the terms of the new agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>With an accord now in pace, Dish customers get a free 10-day free of HBO and Cinemax from Aug. 6-15. Dish users can subscribe to the HBO Max ad-free plan for $12 rather than the regular price of $15 per month for up to 12 months if they act before Oct. 27, 2021. They&#39;ll get HBO Max access on supported devices like iOS, Android, Roku, Apple TV and Fire TV, along with live channels including HBO, HBO Family and HBO Signature. Dish TV customers can also get Cinemax for $10 per month.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f26d8c-32d0-4da6-b5ce-92daca0dace4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 06:15:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623117</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:32:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/458c0180-f0f1-11eb-9ffb-8da3e7244d30" width="1200" height="632" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HBO]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO returns to Dish's lineup after a protracted absence]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-gen Echo Show 5 is back to its lowest price on Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKQk7q">Amazon&#39;s first-gen Echo Show 5</a> dropped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-first-gen-good-deal-081030616.html">down to $45</a> from its original price of $80 ahead of Prime Day back in June. If you missed the chance to get the Alexa-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">smart display</a> at a discount, though, now&#39;s your chance to get one: It&#39;s available for $45 again on Best Buy. That&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the device, even on Amazon, where it&#39;s been selling for around $50 these past months. It&#39;s also $40 cheaper than the second-gen Echo Show 5, which isn&#39;t that much different from the first-generation device anyway.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKQk7q">Buy Amazon first-gen Echo Show 5 at Best Buy - $45</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review</a> for the newer smart display, the changes are pretty minor. The second-gen Echo Show 5 has a 2-megapixel camera instead of a one-megapixel, and it comes in a light blue color in addition to black and white. However, it still has a much lower resolution than the Echo Show 8, and it doesn&#39;t support a lot of the bigger smart display&#39;s capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re not bothered with the one-megapixel camera difference and the lack of an extra color option, you can just get the first-gen Echo Show 5. Its 5.5-inch screen has the same 960 x 480 resolution as its newer counterpart, it has a fabric-wrapped speaker and it has several clock faces to choose from. The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, so you can use it to watch shows, as well as to display images and videos.&nbsp;</p><p>If you find its screen too small for serious bingeing, though, you can also use it as an alarm clock with several clock faces to choose from. It even comes with a sunrise feature, which slowly brightens the screen fifteen minutes prior to your alarm time to mimic the effects of daylight&#39;s arrival. While the device isn&#39;t available in blue like its newer sibling, you can get either the &quot;Charcoal&quot; (black) or the &quot;Sandstone&quot; (white) color options for $45 on Best Buy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fd9c80-4dd5-4c68-86b9-fca5eaff7a1a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 04:45:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627617919</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T04:05:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d358a810-f0e2-11eb-a76f-188f1b5b03d5" width="1500" height="950" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Show]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After making a return to the mid-range with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">RX 6700 XT GPU</a>, AMD has launched its 1080p flagship, the RX 6600 XT. A successor to the excellent and popular <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-amd-radeon-rx-5600-xt-review.html">RX 5600 XT card</a>, the new model has considerably more power on tap with 9.6 teraflops of RDNA 2 performance, compared to 7.19 teraflops for the last model. Not only that, but it offers 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, compared to 6GB for its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the RX 6600 XT seems to deliver about the same amount of performance as the RX 5700 XT (9.75 teraflops) and just slightly less than the GPU in the PS5, at least on paper. Since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-radeon-rx-5700-xt-review.html">RX 5700 XT</a> was offered as a 1440p-capable card (and the PS5 can handle 4K), it doesn&#39;t seem a stretch to say that the new model will at least be decent at 1440p gaming.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, AMD is marketing this card as a &quot;new standard for 1080p,&quot; saying that it has up to a 1.7 times uplift over the last generation for games like <em>Doom Eternal</em> for 1080p gaming. AMD noted that around two-third of monitors shipped are still 1080p, so that&#39;s still the norm for PC gaming.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0dab64e0-f0e7-11eb-a8bf-0e4bf50147f5" alt="AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU" data-uuid="a892f838-20c5-3201-96ee-cbd67724e6f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>Other specs include 32 compute units (compared to 40 on the RX 6700 XT), a 2359 MHz game clock and 160W power consumption with a single 8 pin power connector.  AMD also touts custom features like Radeon Boost for higher frame rates and Radeon Anti-Lag for improved latency.</p><p>The main new feature with the 6000-series GPUs, however, is ray-tracing. That feature allows for higher resolutions (1440p and 4K) while still maintaining decent frame rates and allowing for more realistic images. Don&#39;t expect too much from the RX 6600 XT, however, as the RX 6700 XT struggled in ray-tracing tests compared to NVIDIA rivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-midrange-gpu-130005529.html">in our review</a> — and the RX 6600 XT has lower specs all around.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, it looks pretty impressive otherwise for a budget-level 1080p card. We&#39;ll soon see a raft of RX 6600 XT models from ASUS, Gigabyte, MSI (above), ASRock and others, with MSRP starting at $379 and shipping set for August 11th. Take it as a miracle if you get one at that price, though — the RX 5600 XT had a suggested retail of $300, but street prices were often double that and more thanks to the cryptomining and the global GPU shortage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-gpu-designed-for-1080-p-gaming-033049778.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">830515a6-3b84-40b3-a8ec-a033a2741c73</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 03:30:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627623768</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T05:43:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/deb61eb0-f0e0-11eb-bbff-8cfb8677f1dc" width="1000" height="616" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600XT is its next flagship 1080p GPU]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
