All of those are similar to the Samsung Galaxy Fold in that they&#39;re devices that fold vertically and are the size of a small tablet when unfolded. Recently, however, Huawei has started teasing a foldable phone that&#39;s more akin to the Samsung Galaxy Flip, and a fashion shoot published by <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar China </em>has <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/L6h3qlP5V?ref=collection&amp;type=comment&amp;jumpfrom=weibocom#_rnd1639633936926">revealed</a> what the device looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>The model, called Huawei P50 Pocket, is prominently featured in a pictorial with Chinese actress and singer Guan Xiaotong. It looks fairly large, based on the photos posted on Weibo, with a circular external display that can show the time, notifications and a view of what you&#39;re capturing with the camera if the phone is flipped shut. P50 Pocket&#39;s external display is right next to the camera, and according to <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/huawei-p50-pocket-harper-s-bazaar-teaser-062427696.html"><em>Engadget Chinese</em></a>, its fingerprint reader is located along the edges of the device. The version in the <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar </em>photoshoot is gold with some sort of leafy pattern, but Huawei&#39;s teaser shows that it will also come in a silver variant with a diamond plaid pattern.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Huawei will officially unveil the P50 Pocket on December 23rd.</p><div id="cceef8bc09e244fda391812cde6be82f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Compact yet powerful, that&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HUAWEIP50Pocket?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#HUAWEIP50Pocket</a>.<br><br>Coming soon. <a href="https://t.co/7JKN8uL3Al">pic.twitter.com/7JKN8uL3Al</a></p>— Huawei Mobile (@HuaweiMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/HuaweiMobile/status/1470562962641498114?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-p-50-pocket-revealed-harpers-bazaar-072121090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9acd89a0-8270-4900-892c-a21bfd126d5a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 07:21:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639639284</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T07:21:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68494870-5e3a-11ec-ab9f-686324f289ed" width="1600" height="1009" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68494870-5e3a-11ec-ab9f-686324f289ed" width="1600" height="1009" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Harper's Bazaar China]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Huawei P50 Pocket]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Huawei P50 Pocket]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reddit files with the SEC to go public]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Reddit has taken a big step towards going public.

On Wednesday, the rally driver showed off his new Audi S1 Hoonitron, a purpose-built EV the automaker designed specifically for Block. Audi didn’t share many details on the prototype, but as you can see from the photo above, it pulls more than a few design cues from the company’s iconic Sport Quattro S1. That’s not by accident; it was that car that inspired Block to pursue his career.</p><div id="533ac3dd20bf4b639f172de6fedd7aa0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nCXyP7sl1Cg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Block promised to show off what the EV can do in a future video tentatively called “Elektrikhana.” It’s unclear if Travis Pastrana will join with a custom-built <a href="https://www.engadget.com/subaru-solterra-crossover-details-182128199.html"><ins>Solterra from Subaru</ins></a>.

The lower center of gravity could also make cornering a lot tighter. One thing we’ll have to see is if the  S1 Hoonitron replicates the sound a rev limiter makes in a traditional internal combustion engine car. After all, that sound is part of the fun of watching rally car driving.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ken-block-audi-s1-hoonitron-000802361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1302f810-a75b-4251-9b69-543c4c6a0db3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 00:08:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639608614</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T22:50:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa7c750-5df7-11ec-b7f7-bac50a912b16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa7c750-5df7-11ec-b7f7-bac50a912b16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audi S1 Hoonitron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audi S1 Hoonitron]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Via's personal ride-hailing will shut down next week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll have to say goodbye to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-via-shuttles-in-apple-backyard-cupertino.html">Via&#39;s</a> personal on-demand rides. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/via-shuts-down-ride-hailing-business-to-focus-on-public-transit">reports</a> Via is <a href="https://ridewithvia.com/news/global-transittech-provider-via-focuses-on-high-impact-software-for-public-mobility/">shutting down</a> its ride-hailing operations, currently in New York and Washington, DC, after December 20th. After that, the company will shift its attention to mass transit systems like buses, shuttles and vans. You might still use Via to arrange pickups (including for paratransit) or check schedules, but you won&#39;t have much more control and will likely share the vehicle.</p><p>The company isn&#39;t shy about its reasoning: its public transportation business is more successful. Via chief Daniel Ramot told <em>Bloomberg</em> his firm&#39;s transit business is &quot;growing quickly,&quot; and it&#39;s a more reliable revenue stream thanks to long-term contracts. Via would have needed a &quot;major investment&quot; to return its ride-hailing business to pre-pandemic levels, and the company didn&#39;t want to incur those costs when transit was thriving.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Via&#39;s challenges contrast sharply with its ridesharing rivals. Lyft and Uber have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-lyft-surge-pricing-lack-of-drivers-035835230.html">scrambling to find drivers</a> as demand picks back up. They have far larger slices of personal ride hailing than Via, however. Even if Via were to remain committed to personal rides, it would be competing for a small slice of a market with two clear incumbents. The ride-hailing shutdown lets it sidestep that battle entirely and corner a segment Lyft and Uber have largely left untouched.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/via-ride-hailing-service-shutdown-231321466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a347f2b2-f7a2-4138-82c0-db31f14d3774</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 23:13:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639608032</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T22:40:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/30c54960-5df1-11ec-9be3-a453b04726e8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/30c54960-5df1-11ec-9be3-a453b04726e8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Via]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Via ride-hailing van]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Via ride-hailing van]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hulu's Theranos miniseries 'The Dropout' premieres March 3rd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As with many wild and dramatic stories, the tale of Theranos and its former CEO Elizabeth Holmes is getting multiple adaptations. The Jennifer Lawrence-led <em>Bad Blood</em>, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-movie-200124528.html">just snapped up by Apple</a>, will likely get the most attention. (Expect it to get plenty of Oscar love, like Adam McKay&#39;s recent films, <em>Vice </em>and <em>The Big Short</em>.)

In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple reiterated a prior statement indicating that it &quot;regularly monitor[s]&quot; pandemic conditions and has a &quot;comprehensive&quot; store safety initiative that includes daily health checks, masks, extra cleaning and paid sick leave. All workers will have to take COVID-19 tests before they return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no certainty closures like this will continue in the near future.

While many retail employees have to wear masks and share their health statuses, they can&#39;t necessarily avoid sick customers —and there are concerns Apple store managers may have pressured subordinates to come in despite showing COVID-19 symptoms. Stores can minimize risks, but they can&#39;t completely avoid them so long as the disease persists.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-closes-stores-over-covid-19-surge-213559316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38c6791d-8b95-40d3-bf37-9978bcf384e6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:35:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639604165</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T21:36:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fb96dd0-5de7-11ec-bf37-d28bfc787d2f" width="3600" height="2403" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fb96dd0-5de7-11ec-bf37-d28bfc787d2f" width="3600" height="2403" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Johnny Louis via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA - JULY 24: A Exterior view of a empty apple store at Lincoln Road Mall amid a curfew looming at Miami Dade and Broward County due the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) spike in South Florida on July 24, 2020 in Miami Beach, Florida.

The game developer has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">revealed</a> plans for a <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake that aims to recreate the stealth action of the early games while embracing modern technology.</p><p>The project will use the Snowdrop engine present in newer games like <em>The Division 2</em> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-release-date-202716664.html"><em>Avatar</em> title</a>, but you&#39;ll play in small, linear environments rather than Ubi&#39;s signature (and frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/far-cry-6-release-date-gameplay-trailer-182030303.html">formulaic</a>) open-world spaces. The company wants to meet present-day gameplay expectations, but is also aware that early <em>Splinter Cell</em> was appealing precisely because it rewarded truly stealthy players who demonstrated patience, intelligence and methodical planning. Don&#39;t expect to survive a full-fledged gunfight, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s clearly too soon for Ubisoft to provide a release date for the remake, but the Toronto studio is helming the effort with a mix of veterans from previous <em>Splinter Cell</em> games and fresher faces that will include some new hires. Whether or not the team succeeds isn&#39;t clear. Ubisoft Toronto&#39;s one and only <em>Splinter Cell</em> game was <em>Blacklist</em>, which was well-received but not as revered as the original. The Toronto branch is also still grappling with the consequences of Ubi&#39;s misconduct scandals — VP and <em>Blacklist</em> co-director Maxime Béland <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-vice-president-resigns-assault-accusations-175852405.html">resigned following assault allegations</a>.</p><p>The gameplay promises might bode well if you were worried the remake would stray too far from what made <em>Splinter Cell</em> great, though. And crucially, this could be the launchpad for a true revival. The game&#39;s creative lead, Chris Auty, characterized the re-do as a &quot;solid base&quot; for the future of the franchise. Even if you don&#39;t like the thought of a rehash, this could lead to true sequels to a series that many had previously written off.</p><div id="8bb840cf73174e718a8f0b58a5f988e2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splinter-cell-remake-ubisoft-191516206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ded3661-be01-4917-a3f2-a65a3a6575c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:15:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639594172</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T18:49:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The entry-level 2022 Polestar 2 will have an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p><p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-epa-270-miles-range-190006554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7480b5a5-358b-4663-9be9-17b1ae6d03fd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639596817</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T19:33:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Paul Barshon / Beadyeye]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Polestar 2 EV parked on a rocky road with stone and dirt cliffs in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘OlliOlli World’ arrives on February 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-indie-game-showcase-how-to-watch-155651019.html"><ins>Indie World Showcase</ins></a> stream has wrapped up, and while there was unfortunately no word about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-hollow-knight-silksong-switch-hands-on.html"><em><ins>Hollow Knight: Silksong</ins></em></a>, Nintendo has revealed more details about other games that are coming to Switch.

The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online.</p><p>In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We&#39;re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases.</p><p>It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-533-million-user-personal-data-leak-180156777.html"><ins>500 million</ins></a> Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online.

The studio, which was founded this year by <em>Threes</em> designer Asher Vollmer, has successfully unionized with CODE-CWA — the Communication Workers of America&#39;s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees.</p><p>Operating out of various locations in the US and Canada, the all-remote team of 13 is an unusual case for a few reasons. Foremost, about half of the bargaining unit are independent contractors – typically the exact sort of workers left out of, or deemed ineligible for, a union.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And while much of the push to unionize digital workspaces in recent years has focused on curbing abuses by management and pay imbalances, Vodeo&#39;s does not appear to stem from a need to course-correct away from imminent disaster. Rather, their desire to unionize seems rooted in wanting to maintain an equitable workplace. “They’re not organizing because there’s some big scary boss, like Bobby Kotick or someone,” campaign lead for CODE-CWA Emma Kinema told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa">Polygon</a>. “They’re organizing because they care so much about the work they do, and they want more of a say over how it’s done — the conditions in which they work to actually make those games that they care about.”</p><p>As Kinema alludes to, the games industry has been going through a period of great internal upheaval. Whistleblowers within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/games-firm-rocksteady-accused-of-lack-of-action-on-harassment">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274969/riot-games-lawsuit-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-ceo">Riot</a>, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/brazil-wildlife-report-harassment/">Wildlife</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/game-workers-unite-quantic-dream-1203207491/">Quantic Dream</a>, have detailed harassment and discrimination. There has also been increased pushback against industry practices such as “crunch,” in which studios demand herculean overtime hours from staff in order to hit targeted release dates. Some Activision-Blizzard workers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/16/activision-blizzard-kotick-walkout/">walked off the job</a>, demanding among other things, the resignation of their CEO, Bobby Kotick. They&#39;ve set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/abk-strike-fund">strike fund</a> and are in the midst of their own union drive.&nbsp;</p><p>“All workers deserve a union and a say in how their workplace is run, no matter where they work, what their employment status is, or what kind of conditions they work under,&quot; Myriame Lachapelle, a producer at Vodeo Games, wrote in a statement to press. &quot;We have been inspired by the growing worker organizing within the gaming industry and hope we can set a new precedent for industry-wide standards that will better our shared working conditions and inspire others to do the same.”</p><p>Vodeo released its first game, the <em>Peggle</em>-like RPG <em>Beast Breaker, </em>in September to largely positive reviews. It&#39;s available for PC, Mac and Switch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-games-union-vodeo-cwa-north-america-165537268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6ad61447-0d23-4acb-acee-adf33ea81e00</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639587707</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:02:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vodeo Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[from the youtube trailer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beast Breaker screengrab]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SiriusXM sued over lack of podcast transcripts for the hard of hearing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SiriusXM has been accused of doing too little to make its podcasts accessible. The National Association of the Deaf and Disability Rights Advocates have filed a <a href="https://www.nad.org/2021/12/14/lawsuit-challenges-inaccessibility-of-major-podcast-platforms/">lawsuit</a> against SiriusXM (including its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-24-siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion.html">Pandora</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/siriusxm-acquires-stitcher-podcasts-122816348.html">Stitcher</a> brands) accusing it of excluding the deaf and hard of hearing by failing to provide captions or transcripts for any podcasts.

The lawsuit notably doesn&#39;t include other heavyweights, although Apple and Spotify already offer at least some form of captioning or transcription.

You may well see more complaints in the future.</p><p>The lawsuit is, effectively, a request for podcasts service operators to rethink accessibility.

Visit now and you&#39;ll only see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-only-siri-only-plan-ios-15-2-183416178.html">iOS 15.2&#39;s</a> optional nude photo detection in Messages and intervention when people search for child exploitation terms.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain why Apple has pulled the references. We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. This doesn&#39;t necessarily represent a full retreat from CSAM scanning, but it at least suggests a rollout isn&#39;t imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Apple was already scanning iCloud Photos uploads for hashes of known CSAM, the change would have moved those scans to the devices themselves to ostensibly improve privacy. If iCloud Photos was enabled and enough hashes appeared in a local photo library, Apple would decrypt the relevant &quot;safety vouchers&quot; (included with every image) and manually review the pictures for a potential report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That, in turn, could get police involved.</p><p>The CSAM detection feature drew flak from privacy advocates. Apple stressed the existence of multiple safeguards, such as a high threshold for reviews and its reliance on hashes from multiple child safety organizations rather than government. However, there were concerns the company might still produce false positives or expand scanning under pressure from authoritarian regimes.

In April, it passed within 15 solar radii (around 6.5 million miles) from the Sun&#39;s surface in a region where magnetic fields dominate solar conditions. &quot;Parker Solar Probe &#39;touching the Sun&#39; is a monumental moment for solar science and a truly remarkable feat,&quot; said NASA associate administrator Thomas Zurbuchen.&nbsp;</p><p>The Sun has a superheated atmosphere called the corona (visible from Earth only during a solar eclipse) that&#39;s bound to it by gravity and magnetic fields. At a certain limit called the Alfvén critical surface, materials are able to escape those forces and become part of the solar wind, permanently severing their connection to the Sun.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8a35c03da54d499ba90fd6b3521a5a53"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkaLfbuB_6E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Scientists have estimated that the corona is between 10 to 20 solar radii from the Sun&#39;s surface, or around 4.3 to 8.6 million miles. The Parker Solar probe detected the specific magnetic and particle conditions required for the corona at around 18.8 solar radii, or around 8.1 million miles. It passed in and out of the boundary several times, proving that the Alfvén critical surface has spikes and valleys and isn&#39;t shaped like a smooth ball.</p><p>Inside that region, the probe encountered features called pseudostreamers, or massive structures rising above the Sun&#39;s surface visible during solar eclipses. Flying through the objects was like &quot;flying into the eye of the storm&quot; because of the quieter conditions and slowing particles, NASA said.</p><p>It also made observations that may helped scientists figure out where &quot;switchbacks,&quot; or kinks in the solar wind form. It detected bursts of switchbacks as it passed closer to the sun, and scientists were able to trace those back to the visible surface. Specifically, they found that some types of &quot;fast&quot; switchbacks form in the magnetic funnels created between convection cells on the sun&#39;s surface.&nbsp;</p><p>The probe has not only made the closest-ever pass by the sun, it&#39;s traveling at the greatest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-09-nasa-parker-solar-probe-launch.html">speed</a> of any manmade object ever, currently around 430,000 MPH. The next close pass will happen in January 2022, when scientists will try to determine exactly how switchbacks and other solar phenomena form. &quot;Such measurements from the corona will be critical for understanding and forecasting extreme space weather events that can disrupt telecommunications and damage satellites around Earth,&quot; NASA wrote.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/parker-solar-problem-touch-solar-corona-143207085.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4bf9a34e-2dfe-4701-8e78-4460e4ba95ef</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:32:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639578914</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T14:35:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4ddb6af0-5db2-11ec-85ba-d79ea2226664" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4ddb6af0-5db2-11ec-85ba-d79ea2226664" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Parker Solar Probe becomes the first spacecraft to touch the Sun's corona]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Parker Solar Probe becomes the first spacecraft to touch the Sun's corona]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Tab A8 adds a faster processor, more RAM and storage options]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#x002019;s" href="https://fave.co/3p891Zf">Samsung’s</a> Tab A line has been one of the few options for those trying to find a budget Android tablet. Early next year, the company will release the Tab A8 in the US. It&#39;s not an exciting update, but it does offer a handful of enhancements over its predecessor. Samsung says the new model features an “expanded” 10.5-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and 1,920 x 1,200 resolution TFT panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Internally, the Tab A8 has an octa-core processor the company claims is 10 percent faster than the CPU on the Snapdragon 662 that came with its predecessor. Samsung will also offer a 4GB variant of the tablet, in addition to a 3GB base model. The faster processor should make the device feel snappier, particularly if you go for the model with more RAM. For photos and videos, the Tab A8 comes with an 8-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/361b88e0-5d4a-11ec-bb8f-7759d67ce116" alt="Samsung Tab A8" data-uuid="3480dfca-55f7-3b20-836c-789721f4b35d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>As for storage, the Tab A8 comes with 32GB standard, though you can also configure the tablet with up to 128GB of internal storage, a first for the line. If you need more space, you can add up to 1TB of additional storage through an included MicroSD slot. Powering everything is a 7,040mAh cell. Samsung didn’t share a battery life estimate, but last year we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-review-171525292.html">found the Tab A7</a>, with the same capacity battery, could go 11 hours and 30 minutes in a video rundown test. The Tab A8 supports up to 15W fast charging, but only comes with a slower 7.75W power adapter inside the box. It keeps the headphone jack found on last year&#39;s models and you can expect it to ship with Android 11.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 will hit store shelves in the US next month. Samsung will offer the tablet in three colors: Gray, Silver and Pink Gold. The company didn’t share pricing information. For context, the Tab A8’s predecessor started at $230 – though you could frequently find it on sale for less.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tab-a8-annoucement-140008188.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27aba657-daf9-4acf-9b2f-879ddecee8e9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639588250</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42a7f7b0-5d4a-11ec-a7dd-6b57b6ee85e4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42a7f7b0-5d4a-11ec-a7dd-6b57b6ee85e4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Tab A8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Tab A8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei documents reportedly show involvement in China's surveillance efforts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html">Huawei</a> has long denied working with the Chinese government to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html">spy on</a> other countries and China&#39;s own citizens.

You&#39;ve probably read several variations of that sentence by now if you&#39;ve been keeping track of the observatory, seeing as its launch has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">pushed back</a> quite a few times already. In an announcement <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/14/webb-space-telescope-launch-date-update/">posted</a> on the project&#39;s official page, NASA said that the James Webb team is working on a communication issue between the telescope and its Ariane 5 launch vehicle. As such, it will be launched no earlier than December 24th.</p><p>The James Webb project has experienced numerous setbacks since development started in 1996, due to various reasons that include going overbudget and major redesigns. After testing was suspended in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, NASA worked towards an October 18th, 2021 launch. However, after testing by the agency and primary contractor Northrop Grumman, it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">determined</a> that the telescope wouldn&#39;t be ready until November or December this year. NASA previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">announced</a> a December 18th launch date, which was moved back to the 22nd after an unplanned release of a clamp band that secures James Webb to the launch vehicle adapter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">prompted</a> a thorough check to ensure the telescope wasn&#39;t damaged.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If everything goes as planned this time, December 24th is the earliest possible launch date that could be scheduled. The telescope could be heading towards the second Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system later than Christmas Eve — NASA says it will reveal more details about its new target launch schedule on December 17th. When it does reach its destination, James Webb will observe the universe with a keener eye than Hubble, thanks to instruments that will allow it to see objects too old and too distant for the older telescope.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6b319f7-4433-41ef-bc1f-79ebac39a22a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 11:10:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639575026</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T13:30:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/193a6190-5dab-11ec-b7f7-1b5f8efc7acc" width="1280" height="821" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/193a6190-5dab-11ec-b7f7-1b5f8efc7acc" width="1280" height="821" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ESA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (artist's impression)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (artist's impression)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US puts drone maker DJI and seven other Chinese companies on investment blocklist]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US government will place eight Chinese companies including drone manufacturer DJI on an investment blocklist for alleged involvement in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread.html">surveillance of Uyghur Muslims</a>, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fbcf9467-5b7e-4a81-8b40-d829fefa09ae"><em>Financial Times</em></a> has reported.

Having already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-oppo-foldable-phone-prototype.html">shown</a> a foldable prototype a couple of years ago, it was only a matter of time before Oppo, the world&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">fourth</a> largest smartphone brand, would join the scene. After a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-smartphone-find-n-foldable-112030065.html">teaser</a> from earlier, today the Chinese company <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-092134187.html">unveiled</a> the Find N, which features a 5.49-inch external display and unfolds into a 7.1-inch flexible &quot;Serene Display.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s special about this design is that Oppo went for a landscape aspect ratio — 9:8.4 (1,920 x 1,792), to be exact — for the flexible AMOLED screen, which offers a more practical split-screen usage. A bit like Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">Surface Duo 2</a>, except this is across one single panel. Similarly, the Find N&#39;s external AMOLED screen comes in a more familiar 9:18 aspect ratio (988 x 1,972), as opposed to something like the narrow 9:24.5 on Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Z Fold 3. The shorter body should also make the device more pocketable than its competitors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3a16bb70-5d83-11ec-bfa9-b0a51e7aedd1" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="7d3e3fea-2cdb-349b-95ff-f82df3ae420c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo added that thanks to its special water-drop flexion hinge design, it&#39;s able to widen the angle of the flexible panel&#39;s fold, thus reducing the crease — &quot;up to 80 percent less noticeable compared with other devices,&quot; which is apparently certified by TÜV Rheinland. The same mechanism allows for a no-gap design when folded. As for the flexible screen itself, its 12-layer structure apparently lets it withstand over 200,000 folds — even at temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius or -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Alas, there&#39;s no IP rating for the Find N, but Oppo reassures us that the device has passed the company&#39;s own humidity and splash tests.</p><p>To our surprise, the Find N is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s slightly older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888</a>, as opposed to the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> or the existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888 Plus</a>. Oppo explained that this is due to the longer development cycle of this project. To be fair, this 5G chipset is still plentiful, plus the phone also comes with up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage, along with ColorOS 12 based on Android 11, which should keep things running smoothly on that 120Hz flexible screen (though the external screen is capped at 60Hz).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cd7b1b70-5d8a-11ec-bdff-908be1bbc2e3" alt="Oppo Find N next to an Oppo Reno 7 Pro" data-uuid="8590915e-09b5-30de-b0c7-ed1e6b47bf67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>Other goodies in this 275g device include a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera (Sony IMX766 sensor; same as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html">Find X 3 Pro</a>), a 16-megapixel (IMX481) f/2.2 ultra-wide camera plus a 13-megapixel (Samsung S5K3M5) f/2.4 2x telephoto camera on the back, and a 32-megapixel (IMX615) f/2.4 punch hole selfie camera on both the external screen and the inner screen. There&#39;s a 4,500mAh battery which supports 33W SuperVOOC rapid charging and 15W AirVOOC wireless charging; you can also use the phone for 10W reverse charging.</p><p>Unlike many recent flagship Androids, unlocking is done with a side-mounted fingerprint-scanning power button, rather than an under-display fingerprint reader, which makes sense since it&#39;d be a bit ambitious to work that sensor into the large flexible screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c4d29d0-5d8b-11ec-bfff-107771265ebc" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="eea90a34-a2fb-36e5-b5ed-5e348d40b955"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>On the software side, this version of ColorOS 12 comes with a &quot;FlexForm Mode&quot; which lets you use the Find N in the form of a mini laptop.

Likewise, you can use the external screen as a selfie viewfinder, though this is nothing new in the world of foldables.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fb1af280-5d8a-11ec-b6f3-ead654e9c24c" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="e5a060c2-f236-33f6-9dfc-4a888d5e88c1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>My favorite feature here is perhaps the split-screen gesture: simply use two fingers to swipe down the middle of the flexible screen, and you&#39;ll instantly split the screen into two. You can also tap the three dots in the middle of this virtual divider to create a shortcut for the current app combo. If needed, you can also use four fingers to pinch the large screen to turn the current app into a floating window.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, there&#39;s a &quot;seamless relay&quot; feature which lets you easily go from the large screen to the smaller external screen. As soon as you fold the Find N, the external screen will offer a five-second window to let you swipe up and activate it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2eef1b80-5d7d-11ec-af76-26e57fd8348c" alt="Oppo Find N &#x0052d5;&#x00624b;&#x0073a9;" data-uuid="2a76398b-24a3-344c-90d0-56377ead82ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>The Find N comes in black, white and purple, with the purple offering being exclusive to its higher-end model. In China, this new phone is immediately available for <a href="https://www.oppo.com/cn/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n/">pre-ordering</a> ahead of its December 23rd launch, with the base model (8GB RAM and 256GB storage) asking for 7,699 yuan (about $1,210), and the higher-end model (12GB RAM and 512GB storage) going for 8,999 yuan (around $1,410). That&#39;s surprisingly affordable — even more so than Xiaomi&#39;s Mix Fold.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Oppo doesn&#39;t plan on bringing its first-ever foldable to outside of China just yet, but our review unit did just land on my doorstep a few hours ago. I&#39;ll be spending the next few days figuring out whether this device lives up to its hype (and whether I can even run Google services on it), so stay tuned for our further impressions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01adf24f-9584-43f5-9ed9-1cb7ae1d103b</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 10:12:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639563273</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T10:14:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2f120cd0-5d7d-11ec-b8db-dcf4f76acf66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2f120cd0-5d7d-11ec-b8db-dcf4f76acf66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo Find N 動手玩]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo Find N 動手玩]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
