They&#39;ll even get material tailored to common ridesharing scenarios.</p><p>Drivers will need to have reached Gold, Platinum or Diamond status through the Uber Pro program in a qualifying country (including large parts of the Americas, the UK, India and Spain).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The courses arrive alongside another career initiative. Drivers in some countries (including many of those from the Rosetta program) can request an achievements letter that will help them with job applications.</p><p>Uber wasn&#39;t shy about the official rationale for both moves. Many of its drivers are either immigrants (and less likely to be familiar with local languages) or see languages and rideshare work as key to expanding their opportunities. Uber is aware that driving for the company might just be a &quot;temporary stop&quot; on a career path — this gives workers a better chance to move upward.</p><p>There are practical incentives for Uber. The more languages its drivers speak, the more likely those drivers are to get favorable ratings and encourage repeat business. The career incentives could also encourage more drivers to sign up for Uber in the first place, even if they ultimately spend less time in the role.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-rosetta-stone-driver-language-lessons-150311671.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cbc5ceb-cab6-4bfe-a02e-e5e4b415f47a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 15:03:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627572113</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T15:22:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75653d0-f073-11eb-bef7-e2da0b006aff" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75653d0-f073-11eb-bef7-e2da0b006aff" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LPETTET via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of young people using a ride sharing service.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ride Sharing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei’s P50 lineup is powered by HarmonyOS 2 but lacks 5G]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/huawei"><ins>Huawei</ins></a> has <a href="https://consumer.huawei.com/en/press/news/2021/huawei-announces-new-huawei-p50-series/"><ins>revealed</ins></a> the P50 and P50 Pro, its first flagship phones that use HarmonyOS 2 from the outset.

Thanks to Apple&#39;s new processor, it&#39;s powerful enough to serve most people well and its new fanless design is a big improvement. The laptop normally starts at $1,000, but now you can get it for $850 on Amazon. That&#39;s a new all-time low and it&#39;s $50 cheaper than the price the laptop has been hovering at for the past few weeks.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850" href="https://amzn.to/3rGHj6O">Buy MacBook Air M1 (256GB) at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,099" href="https://amzn.to/3l4aGPo">Buy MacBook Air M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $1,099</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base model comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but you can also grab the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/3l4aGPo">512GB model</a> for less now, too — $1,099 to be exact, or $150 off its normal price. The extra-storage models ship relatively quickly, but you&#39;ll have to wait until the end of August to get the base laptop in your hands. If you&#39;re willing to wait, this is the best sale we&#39;ve seen on the MacBook Air M1 in months.</p><p>We consider the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> to be the best Apple laptop for most people right now. The performance boost that the M1 chipset provides is impressive — sites load almost instantly, scrolling feels effortless and native apps run like clockwork. There&#39;s no fan inside the Air M1, so you&#39;ll get a quieter experience overall — no annoying whirring when you&#39;re pushing the machine to its limits. And the Air M1 should last all day (about 16.5-hours in our testing) so you can use it for work and play.</p><p>The Air M1&#39;s design is quite familiar, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. It&#39;s that familiar thin-and-light clamshell with a lovely 13.3-inch Retina display, a big and accurate trackpad and a comfortable keyboard. Yes, you&#39;ll have to deal with a 720p webcam and just two USB-C ports, but those are small prices to pay for an otherwise stellar machine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-256gb-sale-850-amazon-135649645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e4c1a714-5a2f-491d-961f-552f79386844</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:56:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627567012</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTubers have been rickrolled over a billion times]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the internet&#39;s best-known videos just marked an important (and arguably overdue) historic moment. <em>KIRO7</em><a href="https://www.kiro7.com/news/trending/billion-rick-rolls-rick-astley-video-tops-1-billion-youtube-views/O6PREEJA55HNVGV225LYPSCACI/">notes</a> that Rick Astley&#39;s video for &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot; <a href="https://twitter.com/rickastley/status/1420479592486346757">crossed</a> 1 billion YouTube views on July 28th, putting the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-fortnite-rickroll-emote.html">Rickroll</a> in the same rare company as clips from the latest pop stars.</p><p>Not surprisingly, Astley approves. He told Twitter followers the figure was &quot;mind-blowing&quot; and that he was &quot;very lucky.&quot; He wasn&#39;t originally thrilled with the concept when it first took off, but his daughter eventually won him over by noting that it kept him well-known long after the song peaked in 1988.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This has been a long time in coming.

It&#39;s almost surprising this didn&#39;t happen sooner. Psy&#39;s &quot;Gangnam Style&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-21-gangnam-style-one-billion-views.html">hit the billion-view mark</a> in 2012, and it didn&#39;t have the benefit of a years-old meme.</p><p>Astley won&#39;t top the YouTube charts any time soon.

The T7 also uses ePCM technology and Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels, so it should never get too hot even when you push it to the limit.

Starting today, a new system software update gives beta users in the US, Canada and parts of Europe the ability to boost local storage with select SSD drives. But, the process isn&#39;t as straightforward as previous reports suggested.&nbsp;</p><p>We already knew the required read speeds would be 5,500MB/s or higher, which limits you to PCIe Gen4 SSDs. Of course, there are plenty of drives that can manage that: The Samsung 980 Pro, Western Digital SN850, Corsair Force MP600, Seagate Firecuda 530, Sabrent Rocket 4 Plus, to name a few.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make things more complicated, Sony <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min">says</a> that you&#39;ll also need to take into account the PS5&#39;s cooling mechanism. That means you can either attach a heatsink to your SSD, either in a single- or double-sided format, or purchase a compatible SSD with the cooling structure built-in. But, even then, it needs to be the right-sized heatsink that matches the required dimensions. The total size including the cooling structure needs to be smaller than 110mm (L) x 25mm (W) x 11.25mm (H) or, in inches, smaller than 4.33in (L) x 0.984 in (W) x 0.442in (H).</p><p>Basically, you can forget just popping the cover and slotting in just any Gen 4 SSD. For instance, the Corsair Force MP600 has a heatsink which is too high to fit (though you can purchase it without one and use your own thermal solution). Whereas the WD Black SN850 heatsink should be fine.</p><p>Beyond the M.2 SSD support, the PS5 beta software also includes additional software and improvements. Among them is 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers that can boost sound by measuring the acoustics of a room using the DualSense controller. You can switch it on or off from the sound menu in the console&#39;s system settings. What&#39;s more there are a bunch of control customization options in the Control Centre. Here, the Game Base will also let you message friends and parties and see how many friends are online.&nbsp;</p><p>While PS4 and PS5 games will also be labeled accordingly and appear separately in the home screen and game library. The update also packs a trophy tracker for quick access to up to five trophies per game via the Control Center, the option to pick between 720p and 1080p on PlayStation Now and the ability to enable automatic video clips in challenges for high scores. The software update is also rolling out in Japan, UK, Germany, and France.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ps5-ssd-upgrade-beta-software-130741800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37fa49b7-ff5e-4c47-9b2a-dc7bd49f6dca</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:07:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627564065</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:08:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/734f82d0-2401-11eb-9fbc-c277751d9846" width="7363" height="4141" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/734f82d0-2401-11eb-9fbc-c277751d9846" width="7363" height="4141" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Living room with a Sony PlayStation 5 home video game console and DualSense controller alongside a television, taken on Novemebr 3, 2020.

That was the question running through my mind when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-9-extreme-review-tiny-desktop-120034927.html">I reviewed Intel&#39;s NUC 9 Extreme</a> last year. It was the company&#39;s most powerful compact PC kit (NUC stands for &quot;next unit of computing&quot;) at the time. But it was so wildly expensive — especially since you need to add your own RAM, storage, GPU and OS — it didn&#39;t make sense for anyone but mini-PC obsessives. The new NUC 11 Extreme, AKA &quot;Beast Canyon,&quot; is pretty much the same story. But it&#39;s at least a bit cheaper and more flexible, thanks to its faster 11th-gen Intel CPU and support for full-sized GPUs.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5ae41a77-6821-4a5e-94c6-d221342609ef"/><p>I&#39;ll get this out of the way up front: Yes, this NUC is dramatically larger than any previous units we&#39;ve seen. The 5-liter NUC 9 Extreme already seemed to be pushing the limits of a compact PC, but at 8 liters, the NUC 11 Extreme is what you&#39;d call a Big Boy. Sure, it beats making space for a mid-tower PC on your desk, but it&#39;s still pretty substantial. You can&#39;t blame Intel too much: Gamers wanted full-sized GPUs in a NUC, this is just the most efficient way to make that happen. The big issue now is that Intel is directly competing with increasingly popular Mini-ITX PC cases, which are cheaper but typically more complex builds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NUC 11 Extreme screams &quot;gamer&quot; before you even turn it on. Its black metal case sports mesh air vents along the sides, giving you a peek at the GPU within and three large case fans up top. For a small box, it&#39;s clearly meant to push a lot of air. Hit the power button and it springs to life with an LED skull along the front panel, as well as underside LED lighting. I&#39;m not one for too much gamer bling, but Intel&#39;s lighting comes is relatively subtle compared to many other PC makers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa31-f033-11eb-b9ef-120a9e1ede13" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="5a5d33ab-d721-3c8b-b086-6742ed5dd1cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Our review unit featured Intel&#39;s 11th-gen i9 Compute Element, a modular card with an eight-core 11900KB CPU. It can also be purchased separately as an upgrade for NUC 9 Extreme customers. That was always the dream for Intel&#39;s NUC Extreme platform, which also includes Razer&#39;s Tomahawk mini-PC. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you could just yank a card out in a few years to get a new CPU? There are some compromises, though. According to Intel, there&#39;s no front panel audio support when using the new Compute Card on the NUC 9 Extreme, and there&#39;s no guaranteed PCIe 4.0 either. The company also says compatibility with other boxes depends on how the their NUC base board was designed. (We&#39;ve reached out to Razer to see if the Tomahawk can be upgraded.)</p><p>To help speed up our review process, Intel sent along a unit pre-configured with Windows 10 Pro, 16GB of RAM, a speedy 512GB NVMe SSD, and an ASUS RTX 3060 GPU. Remember, you&#39;ll need to gather all of that gear too if you you a NUC kit for yourself (or just buy one pre-built from <a href="https://simplynuc.com/beast-canyon/">resellers like SimplyNUC</a>).</p><p>While I&#39;ve appreciated all of Intel&#39;s previous performance-oriented NUCs, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-intel-hades-canyon-nuc-review.html">2018&#39;s &quot;Hades Canyon&quot;</a> model and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-09-intel-skull-canyon-nuc-review.html">2016&#39;s &quot;Skull Canyon,&quot;</a> they&#39;ve always been held back by their notebook processors. The NUC 11 Extreme, though, runs more powerful CPUs with a 65-watt TDP. That means it can tap into more power like a traditional desktop gaming chip. And based on our benchmarks, you can definitely see the benefits of that boost.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel NUC 11 Extreme (Intel Core i9-11900KB, NVIDIA RTX 3060)</p></td><td><p>7,167</p></td><td><p>4,143</p></td><td><p>1,684/9,345</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Intel NUC 9 Extreme (Core i9-9980HK.

It was slightly faster than ASUS&#39;s ROG Strix G15, which was running AMD&#39;s powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX. Admittedly, we haven&#39;t looked at any gaming notebooks with 11th-gen Intel chips, but based on that AMD comparison I&#39;d still expect the NUC 11 to come out ahead of those. We also haven&#39;t tested comparable 11th-gen desktop CPUs yet, but I&#39;d wager they&#39;ll perform better since they can draw more power.</p><p>Apple&#39;s M1 iMac was the only computer we&#39;ve reviewed that beat the NUC when it came to single-core performance in Geekbench 5, but Intel&#39;s machine still came out ahead in multithreading. The NUC 11 Extreme also impressed me when it came to transcoding a 4K video clip into 1080p. It managed to do that in 41 seconds, beating the speedy ROG Strix G15 by 6 seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa32-f033-11eb-9ff3-45f5d790980c" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="f3fa6bdc-82dd-34ea-955f-ca46c669b834"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I&#39;m mainly focusing on CPU-bound benchmarks, because the NUC 11&#39;s graphics scores will ultimately depend on the GPU you plug into it. But I couldn&#39;t review a gaming PC without actually playing some games, could I? I&#39;m happy to report that it reached 150 fps to 160 fps in <em>Overwatch </em>with epic graphics settings at my ultrawide monitor&#39;s native resolution (3,440 by 1,440 pixels). I was even able to get <em>Control </em>running in 1440p between 60 and 70 fps with medium ray tracing settings and graphics set to high. (Thanks to a healthy DLSS assist, of course.)</p><p>Basically, the NUC 11 Extreme does everything I expect it an RTX 3060-equipped gaming desktop to do. And despite the tight quarters, temperatures didn&#39;t suffer much either. The GPU never went above 75 celsius while gaming, and the CPU stayed under 80 celsius as well. The fans were noticeable under load, but they were never as whiny as the ones you&#39;d find on some gaming laptops. (Larger fans can push more air without making as much noise, naturally.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="4fe6ace429d84cda8957809d40c49bb2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/021c0081-f033-11eb-bbe6-65dbe1526d38" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop"></section><p>This being the ultimate DIY PC kit, I also had to tear it open to see just how modular it actually was. The side panels came off easily enough, but I had to spend a few minutes prodding the NUC to make its top panel flip over. That revealed its innards, but I still had to lift up the rear panel to remove the screws securing the Compute Element, its plastic blower, and the GPU. It took around 10 more minutes to fully disassemble the system.</p><p>The entire process felt easier than on the NUC 9 Extreme, simply because there was more room to work with. But it&#39;s still not completely intuitive. I also accidentally tore apart the fan temperature sensors attached to the Compute Element, because a mere tug split them in half. If you&#39;ve built PCs before, you should be able to intuit all of the cables and PCIe release levers you need to find. But I&#39;d recommend taking some photos of all of the tiny wires connected to the Compute Element, because it&#39;s easy to mistake where they go and genuinely tough to plug them back in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02368d60-f033-11eb-9bdf-a63c0dee821d" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="2dfb9400-f09a-3d2e-90ff-71879062fbb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Compute Element card was similar to the one I held last year, except now there&#39;s a bigger fan and a beefier heatsink. Given the small workable space, I was also interested in seeing how more powerful GPUs would fit into the NUC 11. NVIDIA&#39;s massive RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 had no trouble fitting, and the Radeon RX 6800 dropped in just fine too. The bulkier RX 6800 XT was a no-go, unfortunately. Its heat sink was just a bit too large to fit in properly. Intel says the NUC 11 Extreme should fit GPUs up to 12 inches long, but be wary if you&#39;re planning to use anything with a bulky heatsink.</p><p>I&#39;ll admit, I was surprised that this NUC could actually fit some of the fastest graphics cards on the market. That makes it far more useful than the last model, which was limited to shorter 8-inch long GPUs. Now, you can have a NUC that could genuinely offer most of the speed you&#39;d get with a full-sized desktop. Or maybe you just want a secondary computer to power your game streaming. Based on what I&#39;ve seen, the NUC 11 Extreme can handle most anything.</p><p><em>But</em>, it&#39;s still very expensive. Intel expects the Core i7 and i9 models to be priced between $1,150 and $1,350. (It&#39;s nixed plans for an i5 model.) You can also get the Compute Elements separately between $780 and $980 — a lot to pay for a card that&#39;s essential a cradle for CPUs that cost half the price. And, once again, you&#39;ll also have to shell out for all of the additional hardware and software you need for a Windows PC. All told, you can expect to pay at least another $1,000 if you want 16GB of RAM, 1TB of NVMe SSD storage and a decent GPU.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/023afa30-f033-11eb-b767-45e7a2548a6b" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="be2db2ef-2d91-3626-b1ba-6b23d046eb8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>That may sound ridiculous, but keep in mind the Core i9 NUC 9 Extreme kit started at $1,639 last year. I couldn&#39;t fathom why anyone would pay out the nose for a compromised desktop that couldn&#39;t fit a full-sized GPU. But the NUC 11 Extreme fixes those issues, and it includes a far faster CPU. If all of this sounds too extreme, you can always consider Mini-ITX case builds, but once again be prepared for pricey hardware and even tighter working quarters.&nbsp;</p><p>Intel&#39;s vision for a world where desktop computers can be both powerful <em>and </em>tiny is slowly coming into focus. Now, with the NUC 11 Extreme, Intel finally has a beefy miniature PC that I could actually recommend (assuming you&#39;ve got deep pockets).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-11-extreme-review-practical-tiny-gaming-desktop-pc-130041721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d318bcf9-fe22-41ef-8157-50e54abc3158</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627566280</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T13:44:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel NUC 11 Extreme]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing’s Ear 1 wireless earbuds are an ambitious start]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How do you stand out as a new tech company when the dominant players have huge budgets, thousands of employees and decades of product R&amp;D? That is Nothing’s challenge, and its first product, a pair of true wireless earbuds, makes a pitch for a simplified kind of tech, designed to stand out from the likes of Apple AirPods, Samsung Galaxy Buds and their myriad clones.</p><p>Design appears to be very important to Nothing, which has already published several blog posts dedicated to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-see-through-wireless-earbuds-inspired-by-a-smoking-pipe-110048181.html">philosophy and direction</a> — and that’s before the company even launched anything. This is the result. The $100 Ear 1 buds feature active noise cancellation, touch controls, a wireless charging case and a particularly eye-catching see-through design,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-wireless-earbuds-release-date-133011498.html"> coming to the US mid-August</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This transparency — a design choice that I love — seemingly resonates with Nothing’s mission to make technology less obvious and more seamless. It makes a statement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bff9-968bbda22a67" alt="Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds." data-uuid="ec946850-6529-38a6-8f72-4f6788471d47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>This styling extends to the charging case, which reminds me a lot of Apple’s old wired headphones that used to come packaged with iPhones. They also came in a half-transparent case. Nothing’s Ear 1 case is predictably more complex. The see-through shell has three indented bubbles that keep the buds in place. There’s a red dot both on the right headphone and its socket inside the charger.</p><p>Like most wireless earbuds, tiny magnets pull the buds into place, but this time they’re visible. Nothing apparently had to find suppliers to make sure its transparent design would work. The company needed glue that was either invisible or at least more aesthetically pleasing, and according to a spokesperson, these tiny, polished magnets were apparently hard to come by.</p><p>So yes, the Ear 1 is all about attention to detail. The case shuts with a satisfying thud, and the snippets of text across the hardware and even the companion app pay homage to retro technology — or perhaps computer interfaces on <em>Alien</em>. These feel like a tribute to see-through tech we’ve seen in the decades past. You might immediately think of those see-through Game Boys from the early ‘90s, but also Apple’s early 2000s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/apple/emac/">eMac all-in-one PC</a>, with transparent casing laid onto white and metal.</p><p>Surprisingly, the price is reasonable. These are sub-$100 earbuds, which would put them up against Beats’ latest truly wireless buds and make them cheaper than Apple’s entry-level AirPods. What do you get at this price, though?</p><p>While I haven’t had enough time to fully scrutinize sound quality, the Ear 1s sound decent, although there’s no spatial audio functionality which isn’t great for new headphones in 2021. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-ob-4-review-150009876.html">Teenage Engineering</a>, which worked with Nothing on these buds, was responsible for tuning the headphones. The sound is <em>generally</em> clear, but seems to lean toward the mid-range frequencies rather than treble and bass, though you can adjust the equalizer to ramp up either of those levels.</p><section data-eng-breakout="af69266eef2942cab7df17a51cf335af" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bf7c-d0c5f07439a5" alt="Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds."></section><p>At this price, they predictably don’t stack up against more expensive earbuds like Sony’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4 ANC buds</a> or Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a>. But, perhaps thanks to the silicone tips, they definitely sound better than the original AirPods. The Ear 1s are plenty loud, too.</p><p>Each bud weighs under five grams, making them lighter than those more expensive options, while still packing active noise cancellation — something Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-a-series-review-160054961.html#:~:text=After%20months%20of%20rumors%20and,A%2DSeries%20is%20only%20%2499.">similarly priced Pixel Buds A</a> lack. After several months using the AirPods Pro, Nothing’s debut earbuds definitely feel more comfortable to me.</p><p>Despite the lightness, Nothing claims you should get four hours of listening with ANC on, and up to 5.7 hours (340 minutes) with ANC off. The case — which is wider but slimmer than most charging cases — can add up to a total of  34 hours of listening. There’s some fast-charge tech, too: After 10 minutes in the case you can get about another hour of listening time.</p><p>The case can be charged through USB-C or Qi wireless charging — another notable addition at this price. The earbuds are also rated IPX4 for sweat and dust resistance, so they can handle workouts that don’t involve too much rain or perspiration. There are touch controls on both buds, and you can slide your finger up and down the stem for volume control, while a single tap will play/pause and a triple tap will skip a track.</p><p>Nothing’s buds are compatible with both Android and iOS devices, and you don’t gain or lose anything depending on which mobile OS you prefer. That is, apart from fast pairing, which is coming to Android devices but isn’t yet enabled at the time of writing.</p><p>As much as I love the aesthetics of the Ear 1, my first impressions of these earbuds weren’t great. When trying to connect to my iPhone, pairing was a struggle. Once the buds were eventually connected to my phone, Nothing’s headphone app said that the fully charged case was empty — or not even detect it at all. Similar chaos ensued when I tried to shift pairing to my PC and Android phone. Bluetooth connections can be messy — this just seemed like a messier than it should be. The case itself seems to have its own Bluetooth profile, separate from the buds. That might be what makes pairing the headphones so frustrating.</p><p>Nothing’s companion app not only offers a different way to switch between noise cancellation modes, but also a way to reassign touch controls on the Ear 1. It’s a refreshing, uncomplicated app. Having wrestled with other headphone apps from Sony and the rest, though some audiophiles might find it a little restrictive.</p><p>There are four equalizer presets: balanced, more treble, more bass and voice. However, you can’t adjust the equalizer manually. The Ear 1 does offer a little more flexibility with noise cancellation with light and maximum settings you don’t often see on earbuds.</p><p>The Ear 1 has three high-definition mics for voice calls, with Nothing’s own “clear voice technology,” which utilizes algorithms that apparently help isolate and amplify your voice on calls. It should also help cut out wind noise.</p><p>I had a mixed experience with the Ear 1 for phone and video calls. With my handset, the three built-in mics coped with the noise of coffee shops and busy streets fine — in fact the people I talked to said my voice sounded particularly clear. When pairing with my Mac, however, audio quality seemed notably worse than other wireless buds and even the MacBook’s built-in mic.</p><p>The Ear 1 buds are an impressive debut device. Nothing’s first product launch is all about selling you on its cool — the company offered a limited run of hardware on StockX that seemed plainly targeted at Hypebeasts and early adopters. The design is compelling, and even the specifications are impressive at this price point. Nothing needs to improve on connectivity hiccups and sound quality if it wants to be mentioned in the same tier as Apple, Samsung and Sony, but it’s a bold start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nothing-ear-1-impressions-release-date-price-130026767.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b49320db-b7bf-48e9-a5c2-6733657402cf</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 13:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627556566</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T11:03:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee23e00-efd8-11eb-bf7c-d0c5f07439a5" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cee80a60-efd8-11eb-97d3-2815a9a202f7" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nothing Ear 1 wireless ear buds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla update adds Disney+ streaming and a Car Wash mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is adding another popular streaming service to its in-car infotainment system. As part of its latest software update, you can now watch Disney+ when you have some downtime during charging. Tesla&#39;s Theater Mode already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-26-tesla-spotify-netflix-youtube-hulu-cuphead-smart-summon-software-update.html">Netflix</a>, Disney-owned Hulu, YouTube and Twitch. All it&#39;s missing is HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount+ before it can call itself a true video hub. A Tesla owner shared screenshots of the &quot;2021.24&quot; update, which includes several additional features, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/otqggp/tesla_202124_software_update_release_notes/">Reddit post</a>.</p><p>Another highlight is the new &quot;Car Wash Mode&quot; that secures the vehicle for a scrub down. Once activated, it can close or disable everything from the windows to wipers to sentry mode and the parking sensor chimes. For car washes with conveyor belts, the mode can switch the free roll option to neutral to prevent the car from auto-braking if you leave.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a new dashcam auto-save that automatically stores clips whenever the vehicle detects a safety event (like a collision or airbag deployment). To stave off any more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-china-local-data-center-182330571.html">damaging</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-chinese-social-media-spying-fears-131002911.html">privacy</a> concerns, Tesla has chosen to make the feature opt-in. Clips will also be stored locally and never shared with the automaker.</p><p>Rounding out the new additions are auto-dimming for mirrors, more battery info, remain connected to WiFi in drive, along with language support for Russian, Romanian and Hungarian. As usual, the quality of life improvements are designed to keep Tesla owners satisfied long after they&#39;ve shelled out thousands on an EV.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-software-update-disney-plus-114824220.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7c96a52-848d-4328-845d-488f471993c6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 11:48:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627568550</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T14:22:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/13b7f910-f061-11eb-bddb-341f92f5afbc" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/13b7f910-f061-11eb-bddb-341f92f5afbc" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: An official Xbox doughnut is coming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of new restrictions on sexual content, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-banning-sugar-daddy-apps-as-part-new-sexual-content-restrictions-081012698.html">Google is banning</a> what it calls &quot;compensated sexual relationships (i.e. sugar dating),&quot; from its Android app store, starting September 1st, 2021.

During the company&#39;s latest earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said its next product release would be a pair of smart glasses from Ray-Ban.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The glasses have their iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things,&quot; the Facebook co-founder said. &quot;So I&#39;m excited to get those into people&#39;s hands and to continue to make progress on the journey toward full augmented reality glasses in the future.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook&#39;s sunglasses have been the subject of rumors since 2019. Back then, sources told <em>CNBC </em>that Facebook was working with Ray-Ban owner EssilorLuxottica on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-facebook-ray-ban-luxottica-orion-ar-glasses.html">AR eyewear nicknamed &quot;Orion.&quot;</a> The glasses were billed as a full-fledged phone replacement on which you could take calls, see information and even broadcast livestreams. That inevitably drew comparisons to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-20-google-glass-enterprise-edition-2.html">Google Glass</a> (another Luxottica collab) instead of the phone-tethered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-13-snap-spectacles-3.html">Spectacles</a> from Snap. Last year, Hugo Barra, then VP VR at Facebook Reality Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/hbarra/status/1306278791669579776">confirmed</a> that the glasses would land in 2021. But, we haven&#39;t heard much since.</p><p>For Facebook, the glasses hold the key to its future. Alongside virtual reality, augmented reality (AR) is integral to building the &quot;metaverse,&quot; Zuckerberg said. In the future, Facebook will morph into a shared, liveable platform that lets you &quot;teleport&quot; between different social experiences using VR and AR, Zuckerberg explained.&nbsp;</p><p>The term metaverse is the latest buzzword seized upon by Silicon Valley and futurists. While the concept has been around for well over a decade, it gained traction after the breakout success of multiplayer game creation platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-09-fornite-playground-cash-cow-minecraft.html"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roblox-sony-in-game-music-153541190.html"><em>Roblox</em></a>. Earlier this week, Microsoft chief Satya Nadella mentioned an &quot;enterprise metaverse&quot; on his company&#39;s earnings call.</p><p>For Facebook, the metaverse is more than just a fad. The company is spending billions in order to build its shared universe, which will be populated with Facebook users and digital ads, according to Zuckerberg. In order for it to become a reality, the company needs more people to buy its computing hardware. Therefore, the plan is to make those devices more affordable.</p><p>&quot;Our business model isn&#39;t going to primarily be around trying to sell devices at a large premium or anything like that because our mission is around serving as many people as possible,&quot; Zuckerberg noted. &quot;So we want to make everything that we do as affordable as possible, so as many people as possible can get into it and then compounds the size of the digital economy inside it. So that&#39;s kind of at a high level how I&#39;m thinking about this.&quot;</p><p>Sunglasses aren&#39;t the only hardware Facebook is reportedly working on. Multiple reports have claimed Facebook is developing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-watch-rumor-222419888.html">smartwatch</a> with a built-in cellular connection and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-smartwatch-camera-detachable-heart-rate-monitor-184825648.html">detachable display</a>. Initially, it was believed that the watch would be first out the gate, but it seems Zuckerberg had other plans.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-100518155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d41ba0e7-6856-435d-bbb5-81f05c562d88</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 10:05:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627550110</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T09:15:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ede9f0f0-f04a-11eb-bfa6-96b85f7cf9b5" width="4176" height="2892" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ede9f0f0-f04a-11eb-bfa6-96b85f7cf9b5" width="4176" height="2892" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SUN VALLEY, ID - JULY 13: Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive officer of Facebook, attends the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 13, 2018 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bang-and-olufsen-e8-sport-true-wireless-earbuds-price-specs-availability-070000788.html">a number of wire-free models</a> under its belt at this point, but there has been on glaring omission over the years: active noise cancellation (ANC). Today, B&amp;O remedied the issue with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:its new Beoplay EQ earbuds" href="https://fave.co/3lgV6Qi">its new Beoplay EQ earbuds</a>. The pricey audio accessory not only offers the ability to reduce ambient ruckus, but earbuds also feature solid battery life, wireless charging and more. The only potential deal breaker is the price: $399 (£349/€399).&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to flagship earbuds from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">the likes of Sony</a> and others, Bang &amp; Olufsen&#39;s &quot;Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation&quot; setup on the Beoplay EQ is powered by a dedicated ANC chip. This means the Bluetooth chip isn&#39;t pulling double duty. That component combines with a set of four microphones to continuously monitor your surroundings and automatically adjust ANC levels as needed. That&#39;s the &quot;adaptive&quot; bit. Two additional microphones are equipped with &quot;retune noise reduction technology&quot; that B&amp;O says results in &quot;crystal clear&quot; calls. Mileage varies greatly on claims of voice quality when it comes to true wireless earbuds, so that description is definitely something that will need proper testing. When it comes to sound, the company&#39;s app offers a feature called Beosonic that allows you to fine-tune things as you see it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5a92dd00-efb7-11eb-bee6-889fc93b6d05" alt="Bang &amp; Olufsen Beoplay EQ" data-uuid="d44e2508-51a7-31d2-ad1f-a656259b4e09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bang &amp; Olufsen</div></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Bang &amp; Olufsen says you can expect 6.5 hours on the earbuds themselves with two additional charges in the case. That case supports wireless charging and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-28-bang-olufsen-beoplay-h8i-h9i-headphones-review.html">in true B&amp;O fashion</a>, it&#39;s made out of aluminum. The company included a quick-charge feature that gives you two hours of listening time in 20 minutes. To help you find the best fit, there are four sizes of silicone tips and one pair of Comply foam tips in the box. Lastly, the Beoplay EQ is IP54 certified, so they should withstand dust and water splashes just fine.

That&#39;s despite the fact that its mobile division saw revenue fall over the previous quarter due to component shortages and COVID-related factory issues.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might expect given the current shortage, Samsung&#39;s chip business dominated its earnings this quarter, accounting for more than a third of total revenue and over half its profits. That was helped by price increases in categories like memory and display panels. The company&#39;s consumer electronics division also saw growth thanks to premium TV sales and appliances.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the mobile division fell off due to weaker seasonal demand, a component shortage and COVID-related closures at its Vietnam factories, the company did make some interesting comments about the business. It said it would &quot;solidify its leadership in the premium [mobile] statement by mainstreaming the foldable category&quot; — meaning we might see cheaper foldable phones in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung revealed that it&#39;s working on new under-screen camera technology, as well.

It&#39;s also become one of the most controversial due to Rogan&#39;s choice of guests and his own views. Spotify doesn&#39;t have any plans to do anything about it, though, because the company&#39;s CEO doesn&#39;t believe the platform should have any say on podcasters&#39; content. When <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-talks-future-of-podcasts-93925d11-d002-478b-81fb-c371743f6c3c.html"><em>Axios</em></a> asked Spotify CEO Daniel Ek in an interview whether the company should have editorial responsibility over podcasts like Rogan&#39;s, Ek responded that Rogan is just one of its many content creators.</p><p><em>Axios</em> pointed out that Rogan may be just one of them, but he&#39;s also one of the most well-paid. Ek responded, however, that rappers earns tens of millions of dollars from the platform, but Spotify doesn&#39;t dictate what they can put in their songs either. Rogan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">signed</a> a $100 million deal with the audio streaming service in May 2020 to make <em>The Joe Rogan Experience</em> available to Spotify listeners.

Rogan has guested several polarizing figures on the show since its debut on the platform. They include Abigail Shrier, author of <em>Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters</em>, and <em>InfoWars</em> owner Alex Jones who spread coronavirus misinformation on the podcast. More recently, Rogan said he doesn&#39;t think people should get the COVID-19 vaccine, though he did backtrack and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/05/03/joe-rogan-told-his-millions-listeners-not-take-his-anti-vaccine-advice-seriously-is-it-too-late/">told listeners</a> not to take his advice seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>In Spotify&#39;s most recent earnings report, it said Rogan&#39;s podcast performed &quot;above expectations.&quot; Clearly, whatever he&#39;s doing is getting people to tune in, so the company probably doesn&#39;t see any reason to step in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ceo-editorial-responsibility-podcasts-040340113.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33577f4a-ab26-470f-8994-7c3ecaf2bfee</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jul 2021 04:03:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627531447</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T04:04:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/b7356e10-9abd-11ea-bcbb-4693105109be" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/b7356e10-9abd-11ea-bcbb-4693105109be" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Syfy via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JOE ROGAN QUESTIONS EVERYTHING -- "Podcast" -- Pictured: Joe Rogan -- (Photo by: Vivian Zink/Syfy/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Joe Rogan Questions Everything - Season 1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will require its US office workforce to be vaccinated]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook will require that its workers get immunized against the coronavirus before they can return to its Menlo Park headquarters and other offices across the US. &quot;As our offices reopen, we will be requiring anyone coming to work at any of our US campuses to be vaccinated,&quot; Lori Goler, Facebook vice president of people, said on Wednesday. &quot;We continue to work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone&#39;s health and safety.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="60f4f40a62884d85b34e8ea5f80ed5bb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New statement from Lori Goler, Facebook VP, People: <a href="https://t.co/W2Ky0jolOu">pic.twitter.com/W2Ky0jolOu</a></p>— Dani Lever (@Dani_Lever) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dani_Lever/status/1420486108769619970?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 28, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">Much like Google</a>, which announced a similar policy earlier in the day, the company said it would have a process in place for workers that can&#39;t get inoculated for medical and &quot;other&quot; reasons.

Speaking during the company’s second-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “video now accounts for almost half of all time spent on Facebook.” And on Instagram, TikTok competitor Reels is the “largest contributor to engagement growth.”</p><p>Though he stopped short of sharing more specific stats, the new details suggest Instagram’s Reels may be gaining more traction as the company vies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">for creator talent</a>. Zuckerberg also noted that the company’s focus on creators and shopping would also help it reach its longer term goal of becoming a “metaverse company.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook revealed earlier this week that it was tapping an Instagram exec to start a new team focused on creating a metaverse. “You can kind of think about this as an embodied internet that you&#39;re inside of rather than just looking at,” Zuckerberg said. “You&#39;re basically gonna be able to do everything that you can on the internet today, as well as some things that don&#39;t make sense on the internet today like dancing.”</p><p>Zuckerberg’s comments come as the company reported some of its strongest growth in years, with revenue of more than $29 billion, an increase of 56 percent from last year. The company also reported more than 3.5 billion “monthly active people,” though user growth in the US once again remained flat.</p><p>Despite the strong numbers this quarter, the company warned that the rest of 2021 could look very different. Facebook expects revenue and growth to “decelerate significantly” in the second half of the year, said CFO Dave Wehner. He also noted that Apple’s iOS 14.5 update, which allows users to opt out of the social network’s ad tracking, would have a “greater impact” next quarter.<em></em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6199e11-9eba-4fcd-bbdf-94d270d59271</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 21:43:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627509814</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T22:03:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" width="7371" height="4916" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SUN VALLEY, IDAHO - JULY 08: CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks to lunch following a session at the Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference on July 08, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho.

Created by YouTuber and former NASA engineer Mark Rober, the Dominator is the result of more than five years of work. Rober had help from two freshmen from Stanford University and a Bay Area software engineer in creating the <a href="https://www.baucomrobotics.com/domino-robot"><ins>googly-eyed robot</ins></a>. The group programmed more than 14,000 lines of code, and outfitted it with components like omnidirectional wheels and 3D-printed funnels to create what Rober says is a “friendly robot that’s super good at only one thing: setting up a butt-ton of dominos really, really fast.”</p><div id="01dc59faf64741ee9bbd306bd111e18d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8HEfIJlcFbs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Up against professional domino artist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1smZYelKX18&amp;t=0s"><ins>Lily Hevesh</ins></a>, the Dominator used its ability to lay down 300 tiles all at once to work about 10 times faster than a human.

A series of conveyor belts ferry the dominions by color before the Kuka arm deposits them in the appropriate chute. When the Dominator visits the station for a refill, the lower platform slides away, instantly loading its 3D-printed funnels with all the dominos it needs to lay down 300 at once.
