This week, NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/sunshield-successfully-deploys-on-nasa-s-next-flagship-telescope">successfully deployed JWST’s 70-foot sunshield</a>. The system is essential to the telescope’s operation. It will ensure its instruments don’t get hotter than 380 degrees Fahrenheit so that they’re cold enough to see the infrared light that Webb is designed to track.</p><div id="07adfd3de99f4224a1425416fa3e0de8"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is it: we’ve just wrapped up one of the most challenging steps of our journey to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnfoldTheUniverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnfoldTheUniverse</a>.<br><br>With all five layers of sunshield tensioning complete, about 75% of our 344 single-point failures have been retired! <a href="https://t.co/P9jJhu7bJX">pic.twitter.com/P9jJhu7bJX</a></p>— NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1478412564983959553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>NASA began deployment of the sunshield three days after the telescope’s successful <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-123452649.html"><ins>December 25th launch</ins></a>. The entire unfolding process took the better part of eight days, with a single day pause for the agency to optimize Webb’s power systems and tensioning motors. When you consider all the components involved, it’s easy to see why NASA says the process was so challenging. In all, unfolding and tensioning the sunshield involved 139 release mechanisms, 70 hinge assemblies, eight motors, about 400 pulleys and approximately a quarter-mile of cabling. If any one of those components failed, they could have set the entire project back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At best, it would have been another delay in a long line of setbacks. Following a redesign in 2005, NASA declared the JWST ready in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html"><ins>2016</ins></a>, but manufacturing complications delayed assembly to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html"><ins>2019</ins></a>. The coronavirus pandemic then led to further delays in shipping and testing the telescope. There’s still more work to be done before scientists can use Webb to study black holes and other celestial bodies. Over the next five and a half months, NASA has to deploy the telescope’s secondary mirror as well as align its optics. After all that, the world will get a chance to see the first images it takes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-sunshield-deployment-185747431.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43e82549-c526-4609-b89a-9f67d72a78d9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:57:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322672</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:58:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92430760-6d8f-11ec-bfff-52a11b63659b" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92430760-6d8f-11ec-bfff-52a11b63659b" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[James Webb]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[James Webb]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technics boasts 50-hour battery life in its new EAH-A800 ANC headphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Panasonic has trotted out all sorts of audio gear since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-03-technics-coming-back.html">reviving the iconic Technics brand</a> in 2014. Recently, that list includes a smattering of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-az70w-review-true-wireless-earbuds-130046061.html">true wireless earbuds</a> and <a href="https://www.technics.com/us/products/headphones/eah-f70n.html">headphones</a>, and at CES 2022, the company has yet another portable device ready to debut. With the EAH-A800, Technics has built a pair of hi-fi-ready wireless headphones with active noise cancellation (ANC) and claims of a whopping 50 hours of use on a charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear EAH-A800 packs in 40mm drivers that Technics says are the result of its experience building hi-fi audio gear. In addition to a new design and materials for that component, an Acoustic Control Chamber manages air flow to assist with driver performance and bass response. The company has also leveraged capacitor tech from its high-end amplifiers to limit distortion and maintain sound quality. The EAH-A800 supports LDAC for higher quality audio over Bluetooth, in addition to the typical AAC standard.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/816c9a00-6d67-11ec-bffe-1223779fe6fc" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Technics EAH-A800" data-uuid="6c6e12d1-f826-3672-b228-9f7ae1d42f94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Technics/Panasonic</div></figure><p>Technics promises &quot;industry-leading noise cancelling&quot; via a dual hybrid setup. An analog filter equipped feed back mic and a digital filter outfitted feed forward mic monitor unwanted clamor inside and out. The EAH-A800 also has Natural Ambient and Attention modes. The difference is that the latter makes it easier to hear voices while the former is a more universal transparency setting. Technics also provides multi-point pairing here, which will allow you to connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth and easily switch between them.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also making big promises when it comes to call clarity. Using a total of eight microphones, the EAH-A800 employs four to pick up your voice and four more to combat any environmental noise. Additionally, Technics says the feed forward mics are designed and positioned to reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most impressive claim on the EAH-A800 is the stated 50 hours of battery life. Technics says you can achieve this figure with ANC on listening to AAC audio. If you are listening via LDAC, the company says you can expect up to 40 hours of play time. Disable noise cancelling on either sound codec and listening time increases by 10 hours. So if you&#39;re willing to go without ANC or higher quality audio, you can get 60 hours of use out of these according to Technics. What&#39;s more, a 15-minute charge will give you 10 hours of use (ANC on, AAC quality streaming).&nbsp;</p><p>The EAH-A800 will be available in black and white color options in February for $350 (£299/€349).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-a800-noise-cancelling-headphones-announced-price-specs-184515539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27f70860-85ba-4629-9fd5-2c4eb08042ca</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:45:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311252</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:47:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Technics/Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen KS-series chips will reach 5.5GHz on a single core]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intel is seriously planning to crank things up with its 12th-generation KS-series desktop CPUs.

The 16-inch model, at least, will be Acer’s first with Intel’s attempt at toppling NVIDIA’s leadership position in the mobile graphics space. That comes with a handful of other quality-of-life improvements, including a 400-nit (up from 300 nits last year), 100 percent sRGB, 16:10 display. You can choose either a WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) or WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) resolution screen to cram inside, too.</p><p>Build-to-order options include a new 12th-generation Intel Core processor paired with the new Arc graphics. That will be paired with up to 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 2TB SSD storage, as well as WiFi 6e. In person, it’s a little lighter than its immediate predecessor although if you were walking past it in a hurry you’d barely know the difference. The webcam is now FHD, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I wasn’t able to take any benchmarks on the pre-release hardware I was able to see in the flesh, but Acer is feeling bullish about the performance here. It says that its new dual fan design, bigger air vents (and they are beefy) and bigger inlets on the keyboard should expel up to 10 percent more heat than previous versions. You’ll also be able to switch to silent running should the need arise, albeit at the cost of much of your performance.</p><p>Acer also made it clear that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-geforce-rtx-30-series-thin-and-light-134500570.html">existing Swift X</a>, which is currently shipping with the option of an RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, will remain on shelves for the foreseeable. That way, should you find Intel’s new silicon not to your taste, you can still get the upgrade you crave.</p><p>The 14-inch model, meanwhile, gets all of the other hardware bumps, including the better display options, the 12th generation Intel Chip, up to 16GB RAM and Windows 11. But graphics-wise, you’re left with the RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, which is probably enough for most users who aren’t yet ready to jump feet-first into Intel’s new ocean.</p><p>We don’t have US pricing or availability for the Swifts just yet, but in the UK we’re expecting them to arrive by the end of February or the start of March for around £1,000 (around $1,350).</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-16-intel-arc-graphics-181536080.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b19e1e5-53db-47fd-9813-5500c2fa3319</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322262</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:51:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Acer Swift X laptop on a wooden table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Swift X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer updates the Nitro 5 with AMD’s Ryzen 6000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often, the laptops that are announced at CES aren’t as exciting as the silicon that’ll be nestled inside them. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s Nitro 5" href="https://fave.co/3sTvdtX">Acer’s Nitro 5</a> is one such example, where less attention will be paid to the more refined design, since everyone will be talking about its new brains. Like the fact that it’ll be able to use both AMD’s Ryzen 6000 and Intel’s 12th-generation Core processors. That will be paired with anything up to NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB DDR4 3200 RAM and, depending on chip options, either a FHD 144Hz or QHD 165Hz panel.</p><p>Naturally, Acer has made a big effort to refine the chassis, despite it being a tiny bit thicker than its immediate predecessor. Rather than lots of chunky accents, the system goes for a more refined striped design, dialing down the more aggressive elements of its design. In addition, several ports are now sat on the back of the chassis since Acer knows that lots of people will use the Nitro 5 as a desktop replacement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sadly, I wasn’t able to do much beyond touch the new Nitro 5 and certainly there’s nothing too dramatic about the exterior changes. Acer was in no mood to allow me to run benchmarks, so all we can say for now is that we’re hopeful that it’ll do what AMD&#39;s other 6000 systems have been doing for a while.</p><p>In terms of when you can expect to be able to get your hands on one of these things, Acer says that the Intel edition will drop at some point in March, with the base model priced at $1,050. The AMD-toting version, meanwhile, will drop in April, with prices running from $1,099 up to whatever your budget and heart will allow.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-nitro-5-ryzen-6000-181528055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">329b250d-e1b4-45c7-8861-39ed93520db5</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322194</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:50:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Acer's Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's gaming laptops add 12th-gen Intel Core and NVIDIA RTX 30 Ti]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer" href="https://fave.co/3nhTZAr">Acer</a> is often quick to embrace the latest chips in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming laptops</a>, and that&#39;s particularly true this year.

You&#39;ll have to spring for the new Nitro 5 (also unveiled today) to pick up a more affordable Acer gaming laptop — these are for enthusiasts willing to splurge.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-predator-gaming-laptop-helios-triton-2022-181520684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78411eff-3fa6-4c3c-af17-7a52eacbb680</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322151</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:49:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c25d3d60-68e6-11ec-aaf3-1ab9d3e3eb14" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c25d3d60-68e6-11ec-aaf3-1ab9d3e3eb14" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Predator Helios gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Predator Helios gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP's super-sized Omen 45L Desktop has a new kind of cooling system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CES, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hp/">HP</a> unveiled its latest lineup of gaming systems, including a tower with a new kind of cooling system.

Now in its third iteration (remember it was originally called Project Athena), the company says it&#39;s also adding a foldable specification for Evo PCs this year, along with new requirements around &quot;intelligent collaboration&quot; and support for faster H-series 12th-gen chips. So, in addition to guaranteeing long battery life and instant wake, new Evo PCs will also need to include WiFi 6E support, tap into the company&#39;s AI noise cancellation capabilities as well as Intel&#39;s Connectivity Performance Suite. The goal, as always, is to make sure consumers get the best experience possible when they&#39;re buying an &quot;Intel Evo&quot; branded PC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b62c7b0-6d81-11ec-bffb-77e9a79b2dc8" alt="Intel Evo 3rd gen specs" data-uuid="c0b5679e-2c23-3aa1-8b4b-33c99aa7a1e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>Intel also offered more details around its <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/intel-to-acquire-israeli-company-screenovate-maker-of-screen-mirroring-tech/">plans for Screenovate</a>, a recent acquisition that gained notoriety for integrating iPhones and Android devices with Windows PCs. (It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-dell-new-mobile-connect-software.html">powers Dell&#39;s Mobile Connect tool</a>, which allows you to send files to your phone and control its screen remotely.) According to Josh Newman, Intel&#39;s VP of Mobile Innovation, the company plans to bring Screenovate&#39;s technology to Evo PCs in the 2022 holiday season. The goal, naturally, is to offer it to more PCs eventually, but Newman says Intel wants to ensure that it&#39;s a high quality experience before that. The company plans to work with partners, including Apple, to make that happen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On stage during its CES presentation, Intel representatives showed Screenovate&#39;s software displaying iPhone text messages on a PC, as well as health data from an Apple Watch. They also demonstrated how an Android tablet could be converted into a secondary display. It didn&#39;t appear to be as seamless as Apple&#39;s SideCar feature, which lets iPads work as screens while connected to Macs, but it&#39;s a start.&nbsp;</p><p>While Intel&#39;s specialized Project Athena/Evo PC branding seemed more like a marketing stunt at first, it&#39;s actually pushing PC makers to build better hardware. Newman says that partners are building off of Intel&#39;s foldable PC design, while also adding their own twists. The specification also gives Intel a bit more leverage: for example, it&#39;s requiring partners to design keyboard accessories for their foldables. While Intel can&#39;t force them to include keyboards in the box, company representatives tells us they&#39;re being &quot;encouraged&quot; to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-evo-3rd-edition-foldable-pc-iphone-181039141.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e97fe72a-ef7c-4f63-b26a-dc05370fcec9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:10:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641320659</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:24:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/02145b20-6d81-11ec-bbfd-aa12ea9e5eaa" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/02145b20-6d81-11ec-bbfd-aa12ea9e5eaa" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman using an Intel Evo branded notebook.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel Evo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP's latest Envy desktop PC comes with 12th-gen Intel chips and RTX 3080 Ti graphics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HP has unveiled its latest Envy desktop PC.

Some of the highlights include the Clutch wireless controller and Plusefire Haste wireless mouse. The former is an Xbox-style Android and PC gamepad that connects to your device over a Bluetooth 4.2, 2.4Ghz or wired connection. Battery life comes in at 19 hours on a single charge and the controller ships with an adjustable clip that can expand from 41 millimeters to 86 millimeters, so it should be able to hold most phones without issue.</p><p>The Pulsefire Haste, meanwhile, has a lot in common with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-gaming-mouse-aerox-3-ip54-rating-180255477.html">Aerox 3 mice from SteelSeries</a>. It’s a wireless mouse with a perforated honeycomb design that’s protected against spills by an IP55 rating.

To recap, the company&#39;s new CPUs (previously codenamed Alder lake) combine performance cores (P-cores) and efficient cores (E-cores) on a single chip. The idea is that they&#39;ll be able to better handle the demands of real-world computing, like juggling gaming on the faster cores while the slower ones power your livestream. In addition to faster performance, that tag-team approach could also lead to better battery for laptops.</p><p>Intel&#39;s 12th-gen laptop CPUs will top out at 14 cores, consisting of six P-cores and eight E-cores (that&#39;s two fewer P-cores than the desktop versions). At this point, Intel is mainly focusing on its powerful H-series 12th-gen chips, which are meant for 14-inch ultraportables, gaming notebooks and other beefy machines. The company also unveiled specs for its its U and P-series chips, which it&#39;ll discuss further in the first quarter. Those will be aimed at smaller ultraportables, as well as &quot;performance thin and light&quot; machines (like Dell&#39;s new XPS 13 Plus), respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for other new features, Intel&#39;s 12th-gen mobile hardware will also support DDR5-4800 and low-power LPDDR5-5200 RAM. Expect to pay a premium for DDR5-equipped machines, though, as PC makers predict stock will be limited throughout 2022. Wi-Fi 6E is also baked in, just in time to hop onto the new 6GHz bands from last year&#39;s 6E routers. And of course, Thunderbolt 4 is back to deliver 40Gbps of bandwidth goodness.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e610d70-6d28-11ec-af7d-2a488be6b91c" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="4b685455-5220-3339-bf76-11bebcff3d56"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p></p><p>While we haven&#39;t been able to test out Intel&#39;s 12th-gen desktop chips, early reviews have <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17047/the-intel-12th-gen-core-i912900k-review-hybrid-performance-brings-hybrid-complexity">praised their multitasking performance</a>, especially with the increased bandwidth from DDR5 RAM. We&#39;d expect a similar upgrade on the notebook front. For now, though, all we have to go on are Intel&#39;s numbers: the company claims 12th-gen is up to 40 percent faster than 11th-gen chips overall. The top-end Core-i9 12900HK is also up to 28 percent faster in gaming, and it has a commanding lead over the Ryzen 9 5900X across many titles.</p><p>In <em>Hitman 3</em>, a notoriously CPU-heavy game, the 12th-gen chips saw an 8 percent FPS bump through better workload prioritization. The P-cores handled rendering and more demanding tasks, while the E-core focused on background audio. As for productivity tasks, the 12900HK was 44 percent faster than 11th-gen hardware in the Premiere Pro PugetBench test, as well as 30 percent quicker when it came to Blender rendering. Intel&#39;s own benchmarks also showed Apple&#39;s M1 Pro and M1 Max, as well as the Ryzen 5900HX, trouncing the Core i9-11980HK in Blender. In many ways, the 12th-gen hardware feels like an apology for last year&#39;s chips.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e613481-6d28-11ec-9fdd-cecdb19ada4d" style="height:778;width:1514;" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="882b052c-8bf3-35c4-8fdb-1d96f2ac9c92"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>More so than the fastest 12th-gen hardware, it&#39;d be interesting to see what sort of performance gains Intel can eke out from its more accessible Core i5 and i7 chips. The i5-12450H features 8 cores (4P and 4E) with a max Turbo speed of 4.4GHz, whereas last year&#39;s 11500H had six cores that maxed out at 4.6Hz on a single core. Both chips have 12 threads (only P-cores support Hyperthreading, so their thread number is doubled), but the 12th-gen chip should be able to use its power more wisely. That could be good news for mainstream PC buyers who can&#39;t quite justify a core i9 machine.</p><section data-eng-breakout="a43c1488c64843eb99465c9005b02d16" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e604a20-6d28-11ec-9cf2-dc3460ae81c1" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="6f41d41c-5f17-302e-a750-8402b91e60d4"></section><p>Intel&#39;s new hybrid architecture also leads to some interesting configurations for its other mobile processors. The fastest U-series model, the Core i7-1265U, is equipped with 2 performance cores and 8 efficient cores. That technically makes it a 10-core chip, whereas the previous U-series hardware topped out at four cores. The P-series performance notebook chips, meanwhile, sport up to 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores in the i7-1280p. Each mobile CPU line also has up to 96 graphics EUs (execution units), just like the 11th-gen chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to new mobile CPUs, Intel also unveiled the rest of its 12th-gen desktop lineup. It starts with the Celeron G6900, which has just two performance cores, and tops out with the 16-core i9-12900. (Overclockers are better off with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-core-cpu-hybrid-alder-lake-160014440.html">unlocked 12900K that debuted in October</a>.) Surprisingly, Intel isn&#39;t including any efficient-cores in its mainstream i3 and i5 chips; they&#39;re all P-cores, so they&#39;re not actually hybrid CPUs at all. System builders can buy unlocked i5 CPUs with four E-cores, but I&#39;d wager that could make things confusing for shoppers. Why is the i5-12600 a six-core chip when the i5-12600K (thanks to the addition of four E-cores) has 10?</p><p>Intel is still lagging behind AMD and Apple when it comes to node size — the 12th-gen chips are a refined version of its 10nm process, while AMD has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-09-amd-3rd-gen-ryzen-7-nanometer-mid-2019.html">building 7nm chips since 2019 </a>and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-zen-4-genoa-bergamo-cpu-191633260.html">eyeing 5nm this year</a> — but the company&#39;s hybrid design shows plenty of promise. Just like with its recent desktop chips, though, the real question is how Alder Lake will compete with what AMD and Apple have in store for 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09e65cb8-fa67-4cff-95bf-623f19b5a0e4</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641278192</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T06:36:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e633050-6d28-11ec-bf1f-7106298adf59" width="2000" height="1240" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e633050-6d28-11ec-bf1f-7106298adf59" width="2000" height="1240" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dell's XPS 13 Plus is a beautiful ultraportable, but it has no headphone jack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="092a35a77e734f9eb97be4b1f2521a5d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvxsgl7X5dA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>We&#39;ve practically run out of superlatives for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">Dell&#39;s XPS 13</a>, the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:flagship ultraportable" href="https://bit.ly/3pPxN21">flagship ultraportable</a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-10-tech-borderless-screen-bezels.html">sparked the slim bezel trend </a>and has remained one of our favorite notebooks for years. So where does Dell go from here? Say hello to the XPS 13 Plus, a more powerful and ambitiously designed notebook with a lattice-less keyboard (read: no space between the keys) and a glass haptic touchpad that blends right into the palm rest. It&#39;s a laptop that looks so sleek, it practically begs to be touched. It&#39;s just a shame that in its frenzy to create a modern masterpiece, Dell also removed the headphone jack. <em>Sigh</em>.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="03bfa111-473f-430e-8b88-8ec9a447af83"/><p>But before we dive into the many problems with that, let&#39;s take a look at what&#39;s good: The XPS 13 Plus pushes Dell&#39;s design capabilities to new heights. There&#39;s a focus on clean lines and minimalism, as if Dell carved a computer directly out of a slab of polished metal. In addition to that attractive new keyboard (which also sports larger key caps), the XPS 13 Plus is also powered by Intel&#39;s 28-watt 12th-gen processors. That&#39;s a healthy jump from the standard XPS 13&#39;s 15-watt chips, and it means you can expect a lot more performance from its 2.73-pound frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a row of capacitive touch function buttons above the keyboard, which look as if they&#39;re embedded right into the computer&#39;s metal case. I&#39;m sure some may prefer sticking with physical function buttons, but losing the extra row of keys adds to the air of simplicity Dell is striving for.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c0f7728cc7a64cafbc57811b3344dee3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f29fba20-6d78-11ec-b7ff-861af9a94f18" alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus"></section><p>But of course, minimalism also means cutting out extraneous design elements, which in this case means the headphone jack and mini-SD card slot from the standard XPS 13. It&#39;s not too surprising to see Dell cleaning up its port situation, but losing the headphone jack seems particularly egregious for a machine that&#39;s meant to be a super-powered XPS 13.</p><p>When we pressed Dell representatives on the issue, they noted that plenty of smartphones are also losing the nifty 3.5mm jack. While that&#39;s true, phones are also a very different use case. It makes more sense to wireless buds or headphones on the go, but I&#39;d wager many people have a nice pair of wired headphones by their computers. Part of me also wonders if the Dell reps have ever tried to connect random Bluetooth headphones  Windows. It&#39;s not nearly as simple as it is on phones.</p><p>During our brief hands-on time with the XPS 13 Plus, I also noticed that its new haptic touchpad could lead to some usability issues. You can&#39;t actually feel where the touchpad begins and ends, which led to some missed clicks while I was browsing the web and poking around Windows. I also occasionally had trouble differentiating between left and right clicks, since it was hard to judge where the center of the touchpad was. I&#39;d wager you&#39;d get used to it over time, but that&#39;s not exactly user friendly. Dell may have been better off using a thin Apple-esque border around the touchpads, which still looks pretty sleek on MacBooks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2a05660-6d78-11ec-acdf-e6f6b6dbdd66" alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus" data-uuid="621f9330-b9a8-3134-9611-c8c62532b320"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite my reservations around some of Dell&#39;s design choices, the XPS 13 Plus still looks and feels like an upgrade from the standard XPS 13. (That laptop isn&#39;t going anywhere either, but Dell isn&#39;t announcing any updates for CES.) The large borderless keyboard is a touch-typist&#39;s dream, and the Infinity Edge display still looks fantastic. You&#39;ll also be able to choose between OLED and LCD screen options, as you&#39;d expect. Dell managed to squeeze four speakers into the XPS 13 Plus as well, a first for its 13-inch ultraportables.</p><p>Dell says it&#39;s targeting a $1,200 starting price for the XPS 13 Plus — a bit more than the XPS 13 — and that it&#39;s planning to ship the notebook this spring.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dells-xps-13-plus-ultraportable-no-headphone-jack-180043410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1890ab5a-1b66-44fd-8db8-2ee3028e320a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641321480</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:38:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2b36930-6d78-11ec-9bff-751fab2ef4f2" width="2000" height="1225" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2b36930-6d78-11ec-9bff-751fab2ef4f2" width="2000" height="1225" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dell XPS 13 Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell XPS 13 Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dell put a 4K webcam in its new 4K video conferencing monitor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the pandemic now almost in its third year, it’s fair to say video calling won’t become a smaller part of our lives anytime soon.

It has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-ces-2022-concept-pari-flow-stanza-hands-on-050112791.html">webcam</a> built directly into its frame. And judging by the spec sheet the company shared, it’s a pretty good one too.</p><p>It features a Stravis CMOS sensor from Sony that can capture 4K HDR video at 30 frames per second or 1080p footage at 60 frames per second. It also features an adjustable field of view you can switch between 65, 78 or 90 degrees depending on how much your environment you want your contacts to see. The camera automatically closes its shutter when you don’t have a video conferencing app open. On the front, there’s also a toggle to disable it entirely.

Dell claims the U3223QZ is the first monitor in its class to feature IPS Black technology. As a result, it has a 2,000:1 contrast ratio. For context, most IPS panels have contrast ratios of 1000:1, so they don’t display blacks as deeply as VA panels and OLEDs do.</p><p>As with most Dell monitors, the U3223QZ comes with plenty of ports. You’ll find Display Port 1.4 and HDMI 2.0 connections, as well as five USB-A ports capable of 10Gbps data transfers. If you need to power other devices, there’s one USB-C port capable of 90W PD and another capable of 15W PD. What you won’t find here is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-28-hdmi-2-1-specification-is-now-available-with-10k.html">HDMI 2.1 connection</a>. If it wasn’t already clear, this is not a monitor Dell designed for gaming.

We had early hands-on time with the Alienware X14, and we found the keyboard particularly cramped — including the WASD configuration you&#39;ll likely use with first-person shooters.  It is a solid and relatively light (no more than 4.06lbs) machine given the components inside, though, so it&#39;s worth considering if you want a gaming rig that easily fits in your backpack.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-x14-gaming-laptop-180002780.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">429a5a43-38a9-485e-b765-21f1575454e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641321531</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:39:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d3331570-6985-11ec-9c7e-a290297d99e6" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d3331570-6985-11ec-9c7e-a290297d99e6" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware X14 gaming laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware X14 gaming laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel's Mobileye unveils a chip that could bring self-driving cars to the masses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Self-driving car technology is currently limited to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/autox-fully-driverless-robotaxi-china-145126521.html">test programs</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-china-geely-robotaxi-080708187.html">specialized vehicles</a>, but Mobileye thinks it can play a key role in making driverless vehicles you can actually buy. The Intel-owned company has <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-ces-2022-tech-news.html#gs.kr9xvo">unveiled</a> an EyeQ Ultra system-on-chip designed with consumer self-driving cars in mind. The SoC can juggle all the computing needs of Level 4 autonomy (full self-driving in most conditions), but it&#39;s reportedly the world&#39;s &quot;leanest&quot; such chip — car brands won&#39;t need to use more complex, power-hungry parts that could hike costs or hurt battery life.</p><p>The EyeQ Ultra is built on a more efficient 5-nanometer process, but the architecture is the key. Mobileye&#39;s design revolves around four task-specific accelerators tied to extra CPU cores, graphics cores and image processors. The result can process input from cameras, LiDAR, radar and the car&#39;s central computing system while handling &#39;just&#39; 176 trillion operations per second. For context, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-atlan-drive-soc-announcement-170009274.html">NVIDIA&#39;s Drive Atlan</a> is expected to manage 1,000 trillion operations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fa1d52f0-6d80-11ec-bf92-b9974ef0ff8a" alt="Mobileye EyeQ Ultra self-driving car SoC" data-uuid="8f4d1c92-0d94-33f0-8297-1c60139887c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mobileye, an Intel company</div></figure><p>You&#39;ll have to wait a while to see the chip in action. Mobileye doesn&#39;t expect the first working EyeQ Ultra chips until late 2023, and you won&#39;t see full production until 2025. That&#39;s roughly in sync with numerous automakers&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagen-id-buzz-robotaxi-2025-121050899.html">self-driving vehicle plans</a>, however, and could help the company fight NVIDIA&#39;s offering.

At CES, they offered a glimpse at the prototype.&nbsp;</p><p>Swedish company Exeger makes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-los-angeles-anc-headphones-solar-cells-080019327.html">Powerfoyle</a>, a material that can turn natural and ambient light into power. Dutch startup <a href="https://www.mayht.com/">Mayht</a>, meanwhile, is behind a type of audio tech called Heartmotion. It claims to have reinvented &quot;the core of the speaker driver&quot; to allow for speakers that can be more than 10 times more compact than other models without sacrificing sound quality or bass output. According to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/04/mayht-and-powerfoyle/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Mayht&#39;s drivers need less energy than similar audio devices, so solar cells are a seemingly sufficient power source for the speaker.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Details about the speaker&#39;s specs remain unclear, such as what percentage of the device&#39;s surface is covered in Powerfoyle material.

Based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urbanistas-solar-power-los-angeles-headphones-review-152013319.html">our time with those</a>, the speaker will need a decent proportion of solar cells to meet Exeger and Mayht&#39;s claim that it has &quot;unlimited battery life&quot; — at least if you don&#39;t live in eternal darkness.</p><p>Whether the speaker can deliver solid sound quality remains to be seen. The physical size of a driver and the depth of a cabinet are key factors in how speakers generate bass, so it&#39;ll be intriguing to hear how Mayht compensates for that.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/portable-bluetooth-speaker-solar-power-exeger-powerfoyle-mayht-172212344.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">044d6851-975e-4b83-872b-2fa44677f793</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:22:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641318311</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T17:45:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fc626eb0-6d85-11ec-8f9e-c7105fac849e" width="1604" height="1093" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fc626eb0-6d85-11ec-8f9e-c7105fac849e" width="1604" height="1093" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mayht]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prototype light-powered speaker created by Mayht and Exeger.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Prototype light-powered speaker created by Mayht and Exeger.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer’s Blade gaming laptops get 12th-gen Intel CPUs and RTX 3080 Ti graphics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It wouldn&#39;t be CES without a deluge of new gaming laptops, and so far, the 2022 edition of the annual trade show has delivered. It should come as no surprise then that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer" href="https://fave.co/3uDrIp3">Razer</a> took the opportunity to update its popular Blade 14, 15 and 17 models. The company hasn&#39;t redesigned the three laptops, but it has made a handful of tweaks. They all feature refreshed keyboards with &quot;slightly larger&quot; keys, a change Razer says it made with the &quot;wellness&quot; of users in mind. They also include a new hinge design that is thinner and enables better ventilation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c86af270-6741-11ec-9efd-dec0359cfa90" alt="2022 Blade 14" data-uuid="5e66df97-c696-311a-83b7-db353041ba6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>However, the highlight of these machines is their updated internals. All three will come standard with DDR5 RAM for the first time. It&#39;s also possible to configure them with NVIDIA&#39;s latest laptop flagship GPU, the RTX 3080 Ti. With 16GB of onboard GDDR6 memory, Razer claims it delivers better performance than a desktop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-03-nvidia-officially-unveils-its-flagship-titan-rtx-gpu.html">Titan RTX</a>. Another option you&#39;ll have is the RTX 3070 Ti. Razer says the GPU is up to 70 percent faster than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-nvidia-rtx-2080-super-gpu-for-laptops.html">RTX 2070 Super</a> NVIDIA shipped in 2020. The company also claims it can deliver 100 frames per second while rendering games at 1440p.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Blade 15 and 17 will also come with Intel&#39;s new 12th-generation Core H-series processors.

Those with money to spare can configure the Blade 15 and Blade 17 with the 14-core i9-12900H. Oh, and all the computers will come with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> pre-installed.</p><p>As you might imagine, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html">Blade 14</a> features the fewest improvements as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razers-blade-14-notebook-returns-amd-cpu-223000755.html">most recent addition to Razer&#39;s lineup</a>. The 2022 model includes a new fingerprint-resistant coating and a 1080p IR webcam with full Windows Hello support. Internally, the computer has one of AMD&#39;s latest 6000 series processors, the Ryzen 9 6900HX, paired with 16GB of DDR5 RAM.</p><p>As for the Blade 15, it will come with a new optional UHD display. The highlights of this IPS panel include 100 percent DCI-P3 wide color gamut coverage and a 144Hz refresh rate, up from 60Hz on the 4K OLED Razer offered previously. Your other display options with the 2022 model are a 360Hz 1080p panel or a 240Hz 1440p screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e4375750-6741-11ec-bffb-8ea2e6bd813c" alt="Razer Blade 17" data-uuid="11db7d80-d85d-31a6-bf52-db606d030c7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Lastly, the Blade 17 gets some of the most practical upgrades. Razer has equipped its flagship with a higher capacity 82WHr battery. It also comes with eight speakers, up from four on the 2021 model. Last but not least, the Blade 17 will ship with a new 280W adapter that, thanks to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gallium-nitride-upscaled-133000829.html">GaN circuitry</a>, is about the size of a 180W power brick.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Blade 14" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Blade 14</a> will start at $2,000 when pre-orders open on February 10th through the Razer website and select retailers, with broader availability to follow later in the first quarter of 2022.

It uses three separate red, green and blue lasers to deliver a billion colors and a 60Hz native refresh rate, while offering features like Dolby Vision, HDR10 and Filmmaker Mode. It also comes with Dolby Atmos playback and ultra high-speed HDMI ports for eARC and auto low latency mode. As with the TVs, it also supports Android TV and all that entails. The PX1 PRO is now available for $4,000.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hi-sense-mini-led-t-vs-can-hit-120-hz-and-2000-nits-of-brightness-170041793.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecdeabbc-da87-427e-a5ed-e846d0caa383</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 17:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641313332</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:22:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4669b750-6d74-11ec-91f7-94a1c9d57f0c" width="1788" height="1094" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4669b750-6d74-11ec-91f7-94a1c9d57f0c" width="1788" height="1094" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HiSense]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HiSense's latest Mini LED TVs can hit 120Hz and 2,000 nits of brightness]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HiSense's latest Mini LED TVs can hit 120Hz and 2,000 nits of brightness]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Formlabs’ new 3D printers are 40 percent faster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Formlabs, one of the few companies to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-12-formlabs-ces-2019.html">turn 3D printing into a useful, real-world tool</a>, is here at CES to show off two new printers.

The company has unveiled an LZ2000 line that focuses on areas some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-g2-c2-annoucement-020045964.html">its rivals</a> might overlook. Gamers get special attention through reduced lag at 60Hz, HDMI 2.1 support, automatic detection of NVIDIA GPUs and a Game Control Board overlay to help you adjust common settings like the viewing mode and HDR tone mapping. These aren&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html">gaming-friendly TVs</a> debuting in 2022, but they may be particularly useful if you rarely play beyond 60Hz or frequently connect to a PC.</p><p>There are some broader audiovisual upgrades. The 4K-capable LZ2000 is now available in a 77-inch size in addition to the earlier 55- and 65-inch variants, and sensors now measure the ambient light temperature to produce more natural tones. Improved processing also improves &quot;mid-level&quot; brightness for well-lit living rooms, and is better at detecting content types like sports. Revamped Dolby Atmos speakers provide clearer audio, a wider sound stage and directional sound that can aim at specific points or areas. You might watch a movie at night without waking your kids, for example.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Prices will be available closer to the LZ2000&#39;s release date sometime in summer 2022. The TV isn&#39;t going to make larger rivals nervous, but that doesn&#39;t appear to be the goal —Panasonic seems happy to serve those frustrated with mainstream options.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-lz2000-oled-tv-164727576.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1a9f44a-2503-4870-93b8-78a1b2972041</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:47:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641314853</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:47:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9ce9040-6d79-11ec-95fe-6acd8979ca9d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9ce9040-6d79-11ec-95fe-6acd8979ca9d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic LZ2000 OLED TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic LZ2000 OLED TV]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
