The &quot;Tesla Virtual Power Plant&quot;  is now entering a beta phase, letting customers sign up, albeit without any compensation for the time being.&nbsp;</p><p>When it first announced the program last week, Tesla noted that &quot;the California grid operator forecasts a continued need for Californians to support the grid through 2021.&quot; That could be a big understatement, as the grid is expected to be heavily stressed over the rest of the summer because of record high temperatures boosting demand, along with a severe drought that could reduce output from hydroelectric plants.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Enrollment is now open for &quot;PG&amp;E, SDG&amp;E and SCE customers who own Powerwall and solar,&quot; Tesla said in a news release. &quot;Enrolling requires the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-app">Tesla app</a> 3.10.14 and a new Powerwall firmware version which will be released soon.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0230fe0-eb74-11eb-b65d-aca15bed2882" style="height:324;width:815;" alt="Tesla Powerwall virtual power plant event notification" data-uuid="6f354170-0c7e-396e-ab17-238d288d98d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tesla</div></figure><p>So how will it work? Tesla gave an example showing that the app will give you a push notification warning a few hours ahead of any grid stress events. It will also show the time period that the event will impact your Powerwall usage, as shown above.</p><p>&quot;Depending on the forecasted severity of the event, your Powerwall may prioritize charging from your solar system in advance of the event to help shift your home’s grid use to earlier in the day,&quot; Tesla explained. &quot;If Powerwall fully charges before an event, your solar system will resume powering your home and export any excess power to the grid.&quot;</p><p>Tesla noted that customers will not be compensated for contributing to the Virtual Power Plant, though it encouraged users to join up for what it called a &quot;public good.&quot; However, customers already on net metering programs will be compensated for any power sent back to the grid as usual, <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/22/tesla-releases-details-virtual-power-plant-public-good-without-compensation/"><em>Electrek</em></a> noted.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-powerwall-owners-can-now-help-balance-the-grid-in-california-052917432.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0bfa0f75-4de9-4a0d-8822-5fe000d60826</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 05:29:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627018160</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T05:29:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87de6b90-eb6f-11eb-9fdf-380227eb1d69" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87de6b90-eb6f-11eb-9fdf-380227eb1d69" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Powerwall owners can now help balance the grid in California]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Powerwall owners can now help balance the grid in California]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM's hands-free Super Cruise is coming to six more Cadillacs in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beginning the first quarter of next year, GM will make its advanced semi-autonomous driving assistant, Super Cruise, available on six more Cadillac models including the Escalade, CT4,CT5, Silverado, Hummer EV, and Sierra.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’re excited to expand Super Cruise to even more new models with additional capabilities to provide our customers with even more opportunities to go hands-free,” Mario Maiorana, Super Cruise chief engineer, said in a prepared statement. “The additional Super Cruise-enabled vehicles and new features are an important step toward our goal of enabling hands-free driving 95 percent of time and getting people more comfortable with letting go of the wheel.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These vehicles will also enjoy a number of additional features that the current generation of Super Cruise users do. These include Trailering capability which enables drivers to engage the system even if they&#39;re towing a load behind them, Automatic lane change, and Enhanced navigation display, which will highlight Super Cruise-compatible routes and roads along the way to your driving destination. Now, if you already own a Super Cruise enabled vehicle and want to upgrade to the more advanced system, you are in luck assuming you bought your GM SUV in 2021 as that is the only model year getting an upgrade. If you bought between 1997, when Super Cruise was first introduced, and 2020, sorry but no dice, you&#39;ll have to change your own lanes like a schmuck.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gms-hands-free-super-cruise-is-coming-to-six-more-cadillacs-in-2022-040101614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">334503d2-f9bd-421e-ae9a-b2c0bcb1dbcd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 04:01:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626987074</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T20:51:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6744160-eb2d-11eb-b5dd-2e74e6ec1172" width="5700" height="3800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6744160-eb2d-11eb-b5dd-2e74e6ec1172" width="5700" height="3800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The CT4-V Blackwing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The CT4-V Blackwing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Music's lossless and spatial audio streaming arrive on Android devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has recently updated its Music app for Android, but it left out a couple of new features you may have been waiting for: support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-now-available-on-supported-devices-094540982.html">lossless streaming</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">spatial audio</a>. <em>Engadget</em> has confirmed that the tech giant has started rolling out the new high-quality streaming options, even though they aren&#39;t specifically mentioned in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.android.music&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US">Android app&#39;s</a> release notes.&nbsp;</p><p>The company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s making the streaming options available to subscribers at no extra charge back in May, promising immersive experiences similar to what Tidal HiFi and Amazon Music HD offer. Both options arrived for Apple users back in June, but they&#39;re limited to certain albums. Apple promised to make Dolby Atmos content easy to find with curated playlists and special badges, though, and it said lossless streaming will eventually come to its entire catalog with 75 million tracks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You will need to use compatible speakers or headphones to be able to enjoy these new immersive listening experiences, though. Apple previously said that AirPods and Beats earbuds and headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, as well as the speakers on the latest iPhones, iPads and Macs will work with Dolby&#39;s spatial audio. You&#39;d have to look up your device&#39;s features to make sure it can also access spatial audio streaming. Meanwhile, lossless audio requires a wired connection and won&#39;t work with wireless audio devices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-streaming-android-034510410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf10b0f1-6050-4e84-9791-0054161d95a3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 03:45:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627011977</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T03:46:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/634f0ee0-eb62-11eb-ae57-34551c2d1e28" width="1306" height="873" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/634f0ee0-eb62-11eb-ae57-34551c2d1e28" width="1306" height="873" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram tests Limits feature to curb targeted harassment]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is testing a new feature called “Limits” that allows users to lock their accounts and limit any potential interactions when they feel they’re the target of harassment.

Daily active users have increased to 293 million, which is a 23 percent growth from this time last year. That’s the best Snap Inc has seen in a while; it tops the company’s prior best of 22 percent, which happened four years ago. The number even tops Twitter’s, which recently reported 206 million daily users in the second quarter.</p><p>Overall revenue also increased by a very impressive 116 percent to $982 million, which is its strongest growth rate yet. That’s faster than even that of Twitter and Facebook, at least right now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also said that Spotlight, its TikTok-like feature that pays users for clips, has grown in popularity. Daily active users of Spotlight grew by 49 percent, and average daily content submissions have more than tripled.</p><p>Much of this growth can be attributed to pandemic lockdowns ending, as well as a much-improved Android app. In a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-q1-2021-earnings-224943122.html">prior earnings statement</a>, CEO Evan Spiegel said that  “as things began to open up in the United States in late February, we saw inflection points in key behaviors like Story posting and engagement with the Snap Map.” However, the recent surge of COVID-19 cases point toward an uncertain third quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>The company said it so far has not seen too much of a negative effect from Apple&#39;s rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-5-users-reject-app-tracking-165309407.html">iOS 14</a>, which forces developers to ask users permission to track their data (often used for ad-targeting). Snap&#39;s business officer, Jeremi Gorman, said that the company actually saw relatively high opt-in rates compared to the rest of the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, Spiegel is hopeful that the development of the app’s augmented reality platform will drive engagement even further. Users, for example, can now &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-shopping-creators-175728100.html">try on</a>&quot; clothes and accessories using the app, and the company also unveiled a new pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html">Spectacles</a> that have AR built-in.</p><p>“We are pleased by the progress our team is making with the development of our augmented reality platform, and we are energized by the many opportunities to grow our community and business around the world,” he said. &quot;More than 200 million Snapchatters engage with AR every day on average, and over 200,000 creators use Lens Studio to build AR Lenses for our community.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-earnings-210932638.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa85241e-05c8-4a1e-be59-1f80ed9e93a2</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 21:09:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626995260</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T23:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/b709e300-d8a6-11e9-b06f-00312702d819" width="5400" height="3600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/b709e300-d8a6-11e9-b06f-00312702d819" width="5400" height="3600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASSOCIATED PRESS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A banner for Snap Inc. hangs from the front of the New York Stock Exchange, Thursday, March 2, 2017, in New York.

The exception would only apply during a public health crisis, which the HMS Secretary would have to declare beforehand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In establishing a rationale for the change, the bill cites a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html">joint report</a> from the Center for Countering Digital Hate and Anti-Vax Watch that found that as much 73 percent of vaccine misinformation on Facebook can be linked to a group of 12 individuals known as the &quot;disinformation dozen.&quot; White House Press Secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1415725645875740672">Jen Psaki</a> recently referenced that same report, saying that many of those individuals are still active on the social network.</p><p>&quot;For far too long, online platforms have not done enough to protect the health of Americans. These are some of the biggest, richest companies in the world and they must do more to prevent the spread of deadly vaccine misinformation,&quot; Senator Klobuchar said in a statement. &quot;The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be and it is our responsibility to take action.&quot;</p><p>The bill&#39;s introduction also follows a recent statement made by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">President Joe Biden</a>. He said platforms like Facebook were &quot;killing people&quot; by not doing more to stop vaccine- and health-related misinformation. &quot;We will not be distracted by accusations which aren&#39;t supported by facts,&quot; a spokesperson for Facebook told Engadget after Biden made his comments. &quot;The facts show that Facebook is helping save lives. Period.&quot; The president later walked back his statement, noting the people using the platform to spread their misinformation were the ones doing harm but reiterated his belief that Facebook could do more to combat what was happening.</p><p>&quot;We have long supported common industry standards and section 230 reform,&quot; Kevin Martin, vice-president of public policy at Facebook said after the news broke. &quot;We believe clarification on the difficult and urgent questions about health-related misinformation would be helpful and look forward to working with Congress and the industry as we consider options for reform.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 10:54PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Facebook.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/health-misinformation-act-2021-204010072.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8e606a-5d37-4d27-bd1a-cc778881cdc1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 20:40:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627008985</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T02:56:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64488f10-eb2b-11eb-9ff3-ff8d606cc1bf" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64488f10-eb2b-11eb-9ff3-ff8d606cc1bf" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ATLANTA, GA - JULY 19: U.S. Sen.

But it didn&#39;t change the price, which means you&#39;ll still pay at least $179 for it. However, Amazon has a new deal that knocks nearly $20 off the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:64GB Apple TV 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3kMMnFA">64GB Apple TV 4K</a>, bringing it down to $180.

It runs on an A12 Bionic processor and it supports Dolby Vision and HDR video at 60fps, plus features like AirPlay 3 and screen mirroring. While navigating the interface of tvOS is a zippy experience, most people probably won&#39;t notice a huge performance difference between the old and new models.</p><p>What&#39;s really key to the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV 4K</a> is the redesigned Siri remote. Now, we&#39;re not saying the new remote is reason enough to upgrade if you&#39;re happy with your current Apple TV, but it does fix a lot of previous complaints we had. The new Siri remote is larger and easier to use, thanks in part to a revamped directional pad that makes controlling the gadget much smoother. The pad is also touch sensitive, so you can swipe between TV show and movie options more easily. We also found Siri to be even more useful on a device like the Apple TV, since queries tend to be more direct (&quot;Play <em>The Mandalorian</em>&quot; or &quot;Show me some new horror movies&quot;) than they are when calling upon the assistant from an iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Speaking of Siri commands, you can also ask the assistant on the Apple TV 4K to show you video feeds from your security cameras. The set-top box has a HomeKit hub built in, so you can connect various smart lights, locks and cameras to it. Video feeds from cameras, for example, will show up on your TV in picture-in-picture mode, so it won&#39;t totally interrupt the show you&#39;re watching.</p><p>The Apple TV 4K will be a tough sell for some since it&#39;s more expensive that competing streaming boxes (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Ultra" href="https://amzn.to/2UvT18w">Roku Ultra</a> is only $100, and often on sale for less), but those who spend most of their time with Apple products will find its conveniences and integrations worthwhile. Plus, Apple&#39;s rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">spatial audio to tvOS</a> later this year, which means you&#39;ll be able to get full Dolby Atmos sound from the Apple TV 4K when listening with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-2021-new-siri-remote-deal-amazon-181228166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a2bf95a-d817-47e6-90d7-a54cdbf81ef5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:12:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626977550</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T18:12:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/e5549830-bfbe-11eb-bd29-331b18490ec1" width="2000" height="1189" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Dead Space' is being remade for PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Dead Space</em> is getting a new chance at life.

Today, the secret&#39;s out. Battlefield Portal is the third mode in <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, and it&#39;s all about community interaction and user-created levels.</p><p>Battlefield Portal includes all seven maps from <em>2042</em>&#39;s All-Out Warfare mode, plus six classic environments from previous Battlefield titles. The classic maps are Battle of the Bulge and El Alamein from <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, Arica Harbor and Valparaiso from <em>Battlefield: Bad Company 2</em>, and Caspian Border and Noshahr Canals from <em>Battlefield 3</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0188700-eb10-11eb-8fff-1c3463e43aca" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="36173e80-41e3-33ae-9128-0690a77f542d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>The mode features pre-programmed, reimagined experiences from these past titles, including conquest, rush and team deathmatch. All of the maps, including the classic ones, will support matches of up to 128 players on PC, Xbox Series consoles and PlayStation 5. As with <em>Battlefield 2042</em>&#39;s main All-Out Warfare mode, matches on older-gen hardware will be capped at 64 players.</p><p>Here&#39;s where it gets <em>custom</em>. Along with the updated, old-school playgrounds, Battlefield Portal includes more than 40 weapons, more than 40 vehicles, and more than 30 gadgets from three theaters of war, plus all of the related content from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>. This means the M1 Garand, Panzerschreck, B17 Bomber, Spitfire, defibrillator and other fan-favorite tools are back.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e01cccc0-eb10-11eb-afed-28891fa33b79" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="5499ac24-f8f0-3f08-9d71-0ac3fe99e007"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Factions are also returning to Battlefield Portal. On top of the specialists from <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, the mode features seven armies from the classic games, including the UK, US and Germany out of <em>1942</em>, and the US and Russia from <em>Bad Company 2</em>. Battlefield Portal also supports classic soldier archetypes like <em>Battlefield 3</em>&#39;s assault, recon, support and engineer roles.</p><p>All of this culminates in the Builder tool in Battlefield Portal. In Builder, players can design their own matches and share them with the community, adjusting a range of settings including the game logic itself. Players will have control over the maps and modes in their custom games, including traits like available factions, weapons and gear; the ability to toggle down sights or go prone; the size of the battle and conditions for victory.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e0144140-eb10-11eb-bbb4-5de70f586e77" alt="Battlefield 2042" data-uuid="7ff3a026-e81b-3847-ba21-bf4d04d6dd20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA</div></figure><p>Players won&#39;t be able to edit any of the actual maps, but overall, Portal has an extremely rich customization mode. All progress in Battlefield Portal is shared across consoles, just like stats in the main game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Battlefield 2042</em> — including Battlefield Portal — is due out on October 22nd, for $60 on PC, Xbox One and PS4, and $70 on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. There&#39;s still one more game mode yet to be revealed, Hazard Zone. We know it&#39;s a &quot;high-stakes squad-based game type never seen before in the Battlefield franchise,&quot; and it&#39;s not a battle royale mode, but that&#39;s about it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-portal-mode-customs-180008313.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a907da5-9322-49ad-8e5b-71cf2c11dce6</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626976424</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T17:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/52c0e730-eb10-11eb-baae-76bbf060524b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042 - Battlefield Portal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next Grid game uses the same virtual set tech as 'The Mandalorian']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/codemasters"><ins>Codemasters</ins></a> offered the first look at the next Grid game during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html"><ins>EA Play Live</ins></a>. <em>Grid Legends</em> features a story mode that mashes together live-action performances and in-game action.

In fact, he&#39;s so optimistic about the cryptocurrency, he reckons it could bring about a more peaceful planet. The billionaire suggested bitcoin could help address financial inequalities and allow humanity to concentrate on bigger issues.</p><p>“My hope is that it creates world peace or helps create world peace,” Dorsey said. “We have all these monopolies off balance and the individual doesn’t have power and the amount of cost and distraction that comes from our monetary system today is real and it takes away attention from the bigger problems.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“All these distractions that we have to deal with on a daily basis take away from those bigger goals that affect every single person on this planet and increasingly so,&quot; he said, as <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/jack-dorsey-hopes-bitcoin-will-help-bring-about-world-peace.html"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes. &quot;You fix that foundational level and everything above it improves in such a dramatic way. It’s going to be long-term but my hope is definitely peace.&quot;</p><p>He made the comments during a panel called <a href="https://www.thebword.org/c/track-2-Bitcoin-As-A-Tool-For-Economic-Empowerment">&quot;bitcoin as a tool for economic empowerment&quot;</a> at a virtual conference called The B Word. Tesla CEO and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doge-musk-233459058.html">crypto market mover</a> Elon Musk and Cathie Wood, chief executive of Square stakeholder ARK Invest, also took part in the discussion.</p><p>Dorsey <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years">spoke in 2018</a> of his belief that bitcoin would become the planet’s “single currency&quot; within a decade. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-033027788.html">Square confirmed plans</a> to make a bitcoin hardware wallet. Dorsey also said last week the company is building a “decentralized financial services” business that aims to replicate monetary systems like banks and exchanges with cryptocurrency.</p><p>There are many hurdles standing between the current state of crypto and the potential for it leading to world peace, such as unreliable internet access in many regions. The power consumption required for bitcoin mining and to process transactions are also at odds with Dorsey’s vision, given the environmental impact of many cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Musk said Tesla would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-221708146.html">stop taking bitcoin payments</a> for vehicles because it was &quot;concerned about rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for bitcoin mining and transactions.&quot; However, he noted during this week&#39;s conference that Tesla may resume such payments. &quot;I wanted a little bit more due diligence to confirm that the percentage of renewable energy usage is most likely at or above 50%, and that there is a trend towards increasing that number, and if so Tesla would resume accepting bitcoin,&quot; <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/tesla-will-most-likely-restart-accepting-bitcoin-as-payments-says-musk-1.5518909">he said</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-world-peace-171030828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">790cfefc-3664-4539-9fac-c0d5dcebfb20</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:10:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626982201</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T19:30:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8a042e00-8e36-11eb-9b3b-ed25a3476562" width="974" height="548" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8a042e00-8e36-11eb-9b3b-ed25a3476562" width="974" height="548" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies during a remote video hearing held by subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on "Social Media's Role in Promoting Extremism and Misinformation" in Washington, U.S., March 25, 2021.

If you’re going to get both, it makes more sense to just get the Playdate and Cover bundle, which is priced at $199. As for the recently announced Playdate Stereo Dock, however, that isn’t ready for pre-orders just yet as it’s still in development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a press release, Panic said that the first batch of Playdate units, which should be around 20,000, will start shipping by the end of this year. After selling this initial allotment, it will then ship subsequent orders in 2022. The company also wanted to assure customers that the Playdate will never “sell out;” you’ll just have to wait in line, as the production is adjusted based on demand.</p><p>Pre-orders will require payment upfront, but Panic says it can be cancelled at any time for a full refund. Orders are limited to two units per person. The Playdate will ship initially to the following countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. It’s also looking into selling the devices in Malaysia, where the factory is located (if you’re in Malaysia, you can fill out <a href="https://panic-inc.typeform.com/to/dyaeItXv">this form</a> so Panic can keep you posted). International shipping costs will include any duties or taxes.</p><p>If you still can’t get enough Playdate, Panic also announced that it’s debuting a new Playdate-focused podcast next week that will give you a lot more background and information about the little handheld gaming console.

The company recently announced that the Playdate will be <a href="http://play.date/">available for pre-order</a> on July 29th for $179, with a ship date of later this year. I’ve been playing with a “press preview” version of the Playdate for the past couple of weeks, and while it’s not perfect, I still think it’s an incredibly charming handheld with a lot of potential. The question is whether there’ll be enough interest — from both developers and consumers — to keep it going for the long haul.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f2756935-7bec-48db-aff9-d8139c2d00e7"/><p>For the uninitiated, the Playdate is not just Panic’s first-ever gaming handheld; it’s also the company’s first piece of hardware, period. Panic made its name making Mac software like Transmit and Coda, and has recently ventured into publishing indie games such as <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> and the yet-to-be-released <em>Nour: Play With Your Food</em>. From its inception, Panic wanted Playdate to be a different kind of handheld; instead of something mainstream like Nintendo’s Switch, it was supposed to be more like the Game &amp; Watch devices of yore, but with a modern twist. “We didn’t want it to be too cool, but we didn’t want it to be too goofy,” said Cabel Sasser, Panic’s co-founder.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thanks to a design collaboration with Teenage Engineering, known mostly for making quirky audio gear, the Playdate certainly fulfills that brief. The hardware is tiny; about the size of a stack of Post-It notes (76 x 74 x 9 mm), and has a black-and-white screen. But its most unique design feature is its fold-out crank, which acts as an additional game controller. It’s this combination of silly and adorable that adds to the Playdate’s charm, and I’ll fully admit that I fell for it the first time I tried a prototype back in 2019.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17733a20-eac0-11eb-bd7b-d2a821ab0f00" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="13493ee1-697d-35d0-8f05-2b4aff147182"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The aforementioned preview unit I have on-hand is the final hardware, though the software isn’t quite there yet. Everything is similar to how it was two years ago. The button placement is the same, with the D-pad and A and B buttons under the display, the menu button on the right, and the lock button sitting on the top (you activate the Playdate by pressing the lock button twice; pressing it again will enable standby mode). All the controls feel responsive enough, with a pleasant clickiness. On the side is the mono speaker, which is surprisingly loud and clear given its size. Underneath is a 3.5mm headphone jack plus a USB-C charging port.</p><p>Most important to me, however, was that crank, which is housed on the Playdate’s right side. To access it, simply flip it open to reveal a small rotating yellow handle, which you can then use to rotate the arm backwards or forwards. The whole contraption feels a lot more solid than I remember; the rotation feels silky smooth, but it isn’t so loose that it continues to spin when I let go. This is a good thing, as it allows for more precise control, which turns out to be quite important in certain games. Internally, the Playdate has a 180 MHz Cortex M7 CPU, 16MB of RAM, 4GB of Flash storage, Bluetooth, and 802.11 bgn 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>The Playdate is molded from what Panic says is an extremely durable engineering thermoplastic, and the screen is laminated to a hardened glass face. That aforementioned crank is also pretty solid; it’s made out of stainless steel, and the handle is plastic with a stainless steel core. The Playdate will likely survive the occasional jostle in your pocket or bag. But if you want to keep it completely free of blemishes, Panic does offer a cover for $29 (You could also purchase the Playdate bundled with the cover for $199).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d7efed0-eac0-11eb-bbfd-b5d151f35301" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="53cdb6d1-7a94-31fd-bfff-edcd79eb95d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>While I do like the hardware for the most part, I have to admit I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the screen. One of the reasons Panic chose to go with a Sharp Memory LCD was because of its super-sharp pixels that use very little power (Pebble aficionados might recall that its eponymous smartwatch used Sharp Memory LCDs as well). I agree that the black and white images do look very crisp, especially in bright sunlight. However, the Playdate lacks any kind of backlight or front light, which means it’s terrible in dim environments. Maybe it’s because I live and work in a relatively dark room, but I found this rather annoying. At one point I had to position a book light underneath the Playdate just to play a game on the couch.</p><p>I should note that the Playdate does last a long time in between charges. I’ve left it unplugged for nearly two weeks now, and even though I’ve played a few hours every day, it still has over half of its battery life left.</p><p>I also noticed an “Upside Down” mode in the Settings menu, which turns the screen, well, upside down. When asked, Sasser said that this is an experimental mode for left-handed users who want to use the crank with their left hands. He did say, however, that this is feature is still subject to change.</p><p>As wonderful as the hardware is, the real value of the Playdate is the content. Though the device costs $179, it will now come with 24 different titles instead of the initial 12 (it’ll also ship with 4GB of storage instead of 2). My preview unit only came with four games however: <em>Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure</em>, <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, <em>Saturday Edition </em>and <em>Whitewater Wipeout</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4bd93a80-eac0-11eb-bfed-b43cad792d9e" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="851100a8-7ddc-3935-a581-cfc68142cdd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I had already played <em>Crankin</em>’ a couple of years ago when I tried the Playdate for the first time. Designed by Katamari Damacy’s Keita Takahashi, the only controller in this game is the crank, which you’ll use to hurry Crankin along his path to meet his girlfriend, Crankette. Spinning it forward will move him forward, while spinning it backward will get Crankin to do the same. The trick is that you have to navigate various obstacles like bees and birds, which exist outside the flow of time. So as you rush along, you have to position Crankin in such a way that he can avoid them. For example, you’ll want Crankin to bend down to smell the flowers exactly when the bees fly overhead.</p><p>That might seem like a relatively easy premise, but the obstacles get more complicated as the levels progress, forcing me to replay them several times before I can get them right. Currently, I’m stuck on level five despite multiple attempts. Guess I’m not going to see Crankette any time soon.</p><p>I much prefer <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, which was designed by Sweet Baby Inc &amp; Friends. In this game, a girl named Prota is going to work for a cat scientist named Marbels (no that’s not a typo), but unwittingly brings her dog Minty along on her first day. Let’s just say that things don’t go well, and Minty eventually goes missing. Somehow, Prota also, uh, loses her “marbles” in the process. As Prota goes around town trying to find her dog, you answer questions by using the crank to roll a marble around an obstacle-filled construction, making sure that the marble hits the answer you want (It’s not explicitly said, but my guess is that the marble puzzle here represents Prota’s brain).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63dab4b0-eac0-11eb-bd9d-cdf334d8b531" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="eaa6c4e4-69ab-3756-9a65-ee24b76690f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I found it a little tricky to control the marble, so I ended up picking a lot of what I thought were incorrect answers. But I soon found out that there’s really no such thing as the wrong answer in this game. That’s because the weirder the answer, the more hilarious the story becomes. For example, when you’re picking the photo for Minty’s missing dog poster, one of the options is for her butt. I didn’t mean to select it, but I did so accidentally. I know this all sounds incredibly silly, and it is, but I also found the whole thing very amusing.</p><p><em>Saturday Edition</em>, on the other hand, is a lot more serious, at least on the surface. Developed by Chris Makris, this is a point-and-click style adventure game which doesn’t use the crank at all. Instead, all navigation is done via the D-pad and A and B buttons. In this game, you play the character of John Kornfield who’s had a long history with aliens, but is currently on Earth.</p><p>The game opens with him in his apartment, and the cops are knocking on the door. Using the controls, you’re able to interact with various elements in the apartment like listening to the answering machine or opening the microwave. The game suggested to me that it’s a lot wiser to exit the apartment via the fire escape instead, so I did. I’ll admit that I haven’t gotten very far in this game — I’ve so far only been to his office and the nearby shopping mall. I do find the story quite intriguing so far, but I’m going to have to sink in a few more hours before I uncover all the game’s secrets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98354360-eac0-11eb-bdf8-066e86715df8" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="4618d6d3-b649-3954-9e80-33235a5bfc54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Last but not least is <em>Whitewater Wipeout, </em>by Chuhai Labs. All you have to do here is surf for as long as possible, performing tricks along the way to earn points. Like <em>Crankin</em>, the only controller here is the crank, which you’ll use to move the surfboard. The highest score I’ve achieved so far is 35, which is not great at all. There will eventually be a global leaderboard which you can use to compare your skills to others.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, my favorite games are the ones with a heavy story element, such as <em>Lost Your Marbles</em> and <em>Saturday Edition</em>. I am not very good with hand-eye coordination, so <em>Crankin</em>’ and <em>Wipeout</em> are not really my thing. I’ll also add that after a week or so of playing the same four games over and over, I got bored pretty quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, however, the Playdate will definitely be getting more games. As part of its $179 price, the console actually comes bundled with a season’s worth of titles — 24 games in total. The first two games will start downloading the moment you activate your Playdate, and then you’ll get two games every Monday thereafter for 11 weeks.</p><p>That is, fundamentally, the sticking point with any console like this — as quirky and glorious as the hardware is, it’ll live and die in the amount of new games you can add to this on a regular basis. The indie gaming community has already embraced the Playdate wholeheartedly — tens of thousands of developers have already expressed interest in making games for it — and the company announced that they’ll be able to sell software and games that can be sideloaded to the device.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Playdate is a fairly niche device — it’s an indie handheld made for indie games — and that’s the very thing that is so appealing about it. But it’s unclear if interest in the Playdate will last beyond its initial release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/playdate-preview-170047433.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e1ecfbc-7157-4e42-93dd-f60cf005936c</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626972399</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T16:47:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Large chunks of the internet went down due a DNS issue]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you can&#39;t access online services like Sony&#39;s PlayStation Network and Steam, as well as websites like Airbnb, you&#39;re not the only one.

The attacks made it so that people in the US and parts of Europe couldn&#39;t access websites like Amazon, GitHub, PayPal and Reddit for almost an entire day.

Still, that leaves many devotees without a path to Wear OS 3 short of buying new wristwear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update will also be opt-in for a reason. The &quot;extent of changes&quot; in Wear OS 3 will require that you reset your watch to factory settings — not surprisingly, Google wants to ask nicely before wiping your device. While this reset won&#39;t be as huge a setback as it would be if it were your phone, you&#39;ll want to think carefully before moving forward.</p><p>The hardware cutoff isn&#39;t a complete shock. Many Wear OS watches on the market are using the three-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-10-qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-3100.html">Snapdragon Wear 3100</a>, and even the much-improved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Wear 4100</a> has been around since 2020. Google might have needed to limit Wear OS 3&#39;s features to support aging processors. Whatever the rationale, this could result in a bumpy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-20-microsoft-unveils-windows-phone-7-8-for-legacy-devices.html">Windows Phone 8-style</a> transition where existing owners have to make difficult choices about when (or if) they replace their devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7914731-4bc9-4b73-8228-90eabee62952</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626960499</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:28:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing Engadget’s 2021 back-to-school gift guide!]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We know you may not be ready to go back to school just yet — but being prepared for the inevitable return can’t hurt.

Created by Nirav Patel, formerly of Oculus, the machine aims to demonstrate that there is a better, more sustainable way of doing things. It shouldn’t be that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-09-google-repair-ads.html">if your tech fails</a>, you either have to buy a new model, or let the manufacturer’s in-house <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/complete-control-apple-accused-of-overpricing-restricting-device-repairs-1.4859099">repair teams charge $700</a> for a job that should&#39;ve cost $50. After all, if we’re going to survive climate change, we need to treat our tech more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-08-apple-battery-iphone-warning.html">sustainably</a> and keep as much as possible out of the landfill.</p><p>It says so much about how consumer technology has changed over the last two decades that Framework even exists. The idea that a repairable, modular laptop is somehow a radical proposition is outrageous given what lurks inside. And some corners of the tech world may think that users will need to put up with agricultural performance and looks in exchange for longevity. That’s why the best word I can use to describe Framework’s first, eponymous, machine is <em>uncontroversial</em>. The only time you’ll need to understand that this machine is repairable, is if it breaks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e9c61-e940-11eb-9d3f-57263f2cba67" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b46a62c5-47e9-36ae-9f0d-1ef30a9337aa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that Framework hasn’t invented the repairable laptop, or even the idea of modular expansion ports. The latter was common in laptops through to the late ‘00s and, even today, many enterprise laptops from the likes of HP and Lenovo have clear, detailed repair guides and easy-to-access spare parts. Framework isn’t claiming credit that it doesn’t deserve, but it is here, much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-plus-hands-on-090004841.html">Fairphone</a>, to show everyone that we shouldn’t tolerate the default.</p><p>There’s nothing spectacular, eye-catching or otherwise attention-seeking about the design of the first Framework laptop. Walk past it in a hurry and you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for any other 13-inch notebook made in the last half a decade. The aluminum body (made with up to 50 percent post-consumer recycled aluminum) makes it look like an old-school MacBook. From the front, it’s unmistakably a Windows laptop, but again, there are no steampunk flexes here. It’s only when you’re looking at it off-angle that you can tell something’s different.</p><h3>I/O</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2731-e940-11eb-b3ef-de2f3923b996" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="cb038618-09d2-3ff9-a873-0ddaa896604d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Rather than having ports stacked tight at the top of the mainboard, each side of Framework’s deck has two wide voids. Peer inside and you’ll see a USB-C port just visible buried deep in the machine’s guts. These voids are designed to house four “expansion cards” which can be swapped in depending on your need (so long as you press the release button on the bottom).</p><p>Each card offers a single port, connecting to the laptop over USB-C, and is designed to eliminate the need for a dedicated dongle. In the standard setup, you’ll get a quartet of USB-C cards — and you’ll need at least one for charging — but there are a number of others available. That includes options for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI and a microSD Card reader. You can also order an expansion card with additional external storage, with 250GB costing $69, and 1TB setting you back $149. Framework says that users can lobby for different cards in future, so all of those folks grousing for a full-size SD-card reader can get cracking.</p><p>Nestled between the ports is a small, white LED which lets you know when the machine is connected to power. Oh, and there’s a dedicated 3.5mm audio jack.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c1-e940-11eb-baf3-f6841a03021f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b3b6e59e-f180-3b0c-b419-2709465e1c36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>My one complaint about the look of this thing is that the sides of the deck artificially taper in to make it look thinner than it really is. Because the base flares out underneath almost immediately, it looks a bit like it’s cheating. It would have been nicer if Framework had embraced the pleasant squareness of its design, rather than trying to disguise it.</p><p>In terms of build quality, the only thing to add is that the machine has a lot more flex than its contemporaries. This is, broadly speaking, the one benefit of these all-in-one, glue-heavy machines which are difficult to repair. The Framework, by comparison, squeaks and creaks when you twist the case, and you can see the dividing line between the keyboard and the rest of the deck as you do so.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display is lovely, and I feel like these days displays are so hard to mess up that there’s little more you can say about them. The backlight will push up to 400 nits, which is certainly the standard you’d expect from laptops in this class. Given that this machine is designed for productivity work you’re not going to come away with bleeding eyes if you stare at this for hours each day.</p><h3>Keyboard and Trackpad</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d05ac0-e940-11eb-ad9b-d6d7a343aa3f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="c2aac9ca-63ca-379f-833f-4d25aee5b17a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework, from the outset, made it clear that it wanted to nail the fundamentals of what makes a good laptop. Naturally, a good keyboard is key, especially given how much time people will be spending on this thing each day. Here we’ve got an old-fashioned, uncontroversial chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and a soft (ish) landing. This was the standard for a good keyboard a decade ago, and little has changed, although the landing here is a little bit<em> too</em> soft. Clearly, this is a machine that won’t irritate other people when you’re typing on the train, but the quiet key presses come at the expense of some sharpness.</p><p>The trackpad, meanwhile, is similarly standard-issue, it’s a good size, with a satisfying click when you push it down and it’s reactive when you tap it. It couldn’t be much bigger given the size of the laptop’s deck, nor is it obtrusively placed. This is a satisfying thing to use, and I found myself defaulting to it rather than to my mouse, which almost never happens.</p><h3>Webcam and Audio</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd3-e940-11eb-bf4f-94c96dc9c062" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="dbe24dd1-00df-3258-8bd5-2b334bdeb321"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Framework laptop is equipped with a 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view, and it’s one of the best built-in webcams I’ve seen. Founder Nirav Patel told me that he had always intended to use a high-quality webcam, and felt vindicated by the pandemic. And either side of the webcam are hardware privacy switches to disable both the webcam and the microphone. These are “soft” switches that cut power to those components rather than physically obscuring the lens, and putting them on the top bezel is a strong flex, but not one I’m opposed to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d48c37f0-e940-11eb-9f5e-e706411fb739" alt="ISNT HE SMOULDERING " data-uuid="8400f32d-c48e-3355-ac63-fa417b3ef3e0"><figcaption>Isn&#39;t he smouldering?</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I have fewer nice things to say about the side-firing 2W speakers that are broadly, generically, sort-of okay. The sound coming out of them is tinny, weak and muddy, with bass so weak that Budweiser seems strong in comparison. If you’re going to be using this as the center of your audio/visual world, then invest in a decent pair of speakers or headphones.</p><h2><strong>Performance and Battery Life</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c3-e940-11eb-9f7b-ef8ec241bd38" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="4c3e443a-fff9-3208-ab03-8073a17669f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The model that I’m testing is the $1,399 “Performance” model, which is packing Intel’s Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. All of the models, no matter the price, come with Intel’s Iris Xe graphics with no option for adding a discrete GPU. And certainly, in the week I used it, I don’t think I saw any lag or stuttering, and it handles undemanding games well enough. Benchmarks don’t tell the whole story, but in PC Mark 10’s standard score the machine averaged at 4927, outperforming a machine like the Surface Laptop 4.</p><p>As for battery life, I certainly didn’t find myself dashing for the nearest outlet while using this machine. In our standard rundown test, with display brightness set to 65 percent and an HD video looping, the Framework lasted 7 hours 46 minutes on its 55Wh battery. That’s enough to get you through a working day, but I would have vastly preferred it to crawl past that eight hour mark. A lot of machines in the 13-inch category can now get closer to 10 hours, and Intel’s Evo program insists upon it if your laptop has an HD-only display. The higher res screen probably offers Framework enough of a pass, but it’s something to bear in mind.</p><p>In terms of real-world performance, I spent about a week using Framework as my primary machine. Knocking around with Spotify open, several Chrome tabs and Slack all at once and I didn’t feel things dragging too much. A title like <em>Fortnite</em>, runs buttery-smooth on Medium settings and feels about right for this sort of work-first machine. Certainly, if you’re looking for a machine that can do work and (light) play, this will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with many ultrabooks in its class.</p><h2><strong>DIY</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2730-e940-11eb-a3fb-a6620b2122ff" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2310a383-67c9-39fa-8e8b-417809582170"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Like the modular, repairable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-3-plus-repair-camera-swap-153053319.html">Fairphone</a>, Framework ships with a Torx T5 screwdriver in the box, and every screw uses that same head. Five screws are all that connect the top of the laptop’s deck, containing the fingerprint sensor, keyboard and trackpad, to the rest of the base. Pull that off, and you can then gently pry off the display bezel, which is attached to the screen with a series of magnets.</p><p>Once inside, you’ll spot that every component is labeled, with a QR code which links to friendly, iFixit-style repair guides. Construction isn’t vastly different from any other laptop, the company hasn’t left big pockets of space to aid repairability. In many ways, this is the best thing that this machine can do: Show consumers (and manufacturers) that making laptops easy to repair is very easy… if you try.</p><p>Framework shipped with its default US keyboard but, in a separate package, the company sent over a UK-format keyboard and top deck. I didn’t need to change it, and ordinarily I wouldn’t start disassembling a review laptop, but Framework said people should feel free to “poke around in the guts of the project.” So, with a sense of giddy empowerment, I thought I might as well swap units to see how easy, and safe, it was to swap the keyboards.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d00ca0-e940-11eb-bfe6-54df372db068" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="38c017d9-cab2-3aec-aacf-e0d6b443c625"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Armed with my screwdriver and the documentation, I was able to unscrew the mounting bolts which hold the top deck to the rest. Once lifted off, I had to unplug one clearly labeled ribbon cable, pop the replacement keyboard back on and screw everything back together. This process took me three minutes and 54 seconds, which would have been half the time had I realized sooner that the screws were captive, and so were designed to be held inside the laptop’s body.</p><p>I have never felt more confident that I could repair this machine, and that this should be the default for all consumer laptops. Imagine, for instance, when a very famous laptop maker decided to use a different keyboard technology for its most popular machines. A keyboard technology that was found to be notoriously unreliable despite a number of revisions. Now imagine how many machines wouldn’t need to be sent back for repair, and the countless hours of working time lost to them, if it was this easy to replace the keyboard at home.</p><p>More crucially, if your laptop does get too slow for you to use, you can (with patience) swap out the mainboard, which houses the CPU (and, by extension, the integrated graphics). The idea being that in several years’ time, if your speakers, display, keyboard and everything else are working fine, why replace them. Unfortunately, buying this machine does require you to trust that the company will be around long enough to make good on that promise.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Price and the Competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd1-e940-11eb-be7c-34478b8923f6" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="8b9b39ad-f5c6-387b-ad08-404f9d76825e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework is releasing four versions of this machine, a $749 DIY edition which lets you choose a wide number of specs yourself, or provide your own. In the ready-to-use category, however, you have a $999 base model with a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. Then there’s the Performance model, which for $1,399 gets you a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Topping the chart is the $1,999 Professional edition, with a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd0-e940-11eb-b3fd-d97cb4ee49b5" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2328f502-2fcd-38df-a506-9e8f140345d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Given what Framework is offering here, it doesn’t make sense to just compare this machine to others at those $999, $1,399 and $1,999 price tiers. Instead, I checked <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/laptop-repairability">iFixit’s</a> chart of laptops which scored well on the repairability charts. One of the best performers was HP’s EliteBook 840 G7, which scored 9/10, and has a common screw format and easy to replace components. The 2021 version of that machine, the <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-840-g8-notebook-pc-p-360w8ut-aba-1">G8</a>, will set you back $1,879 for a 14-inch FHD display with a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD (or it would, but it’s out of stock).</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd4-e940-11eb-bbff-160533111ae9" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="d81d5d36-000e-39b4-8892-c935a668967b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One problem with reviewing this machine is the desire not to bang on too much about The Context. We need to be able to judge this thing on its merits and, in that regard, it’s a pretty good laptop, certainly at this price and with this performance. What will motivate you to buy one, at least right now however, is the idea that you may be able to run this thing for years. If a component breaks that isn’t on the mainboard, you should be able to find a replacement. And you should be able to swap it in without any soldering or other such expertise. Many of the other parts are standard and easily removed, so when you need more RAM, a bigger SSD or faster WiFi, that should be an easy job. And, really, that’s what you’re paying for: The hope that you can use this device without complaint not just for the next few years, <a href="https://frame.work/">but maybe the next decade</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47d17f5b-e2ac-4042-8ad0-858394371dda</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626983782</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T19:56:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Framework Laptop Hero Image]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Framework Laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
