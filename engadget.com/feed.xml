Like with any of the social network&#39;s experiments, it will only be available to a limited number of accounts. But those who do get access to the test will be able to call friends on the platform without having to fire up the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>As the publication notes, this looks like a move Facebook is exploring to further streamline its services that include Messenger, which became a separate app in 2014, and WhatsApp. Connor Hayes, director of product management at Messenger, told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it&#39;s meant to reduce the need to jump back and forth between the company&#39;s main app and its Messenger service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook already has plans to unify its messaging apps. In September 2020, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chat-across-instagram-and-messenger-120049504.html">enabled the ability</a> to chat and send messages between Instagram and Messenger, and the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-30-facebook-will-let-users-chat-across-messenger-instagram-and-wha.html">previously said</a> that WhatsApp would also get inter-app messaging capabilities. The company tested putting a simpler version of Messenger within the main app last year, as well. That&#39;s something the social network been considering since at least 2019 when Jane Manchun Wong found an experimental feature that takes users straight to a &quot;Chats&quot; section when they tap on the messaging icon. Currently, doing so automatically opens the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>Hayes told the publication that Facebook now considers Messenger as a service instead of a standalone app. We may see more of its technologies across the company&#39;s other apps in the future — in fact, Instagram, Oculus and Portal devices already use Messenger&#39;s technology for voice and video calls. &quot;You’re going to start to see quite a bit more of this over time,&quot; he said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-test-voice-video-calls-main-app-101603664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1a0cf5d-d2aa-420b-9707-dc8ce49b0ed3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 10:16:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629800174</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T10:16:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[May 26, 2019 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters located in Silicon Valley (1 Hacker Way);]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oculus update lets Quest headsets auto-sync VR media to mobile]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Oculus">Oculus</a> is rolling out an update to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-oculus-quest-pro-vr-headset-164646103.html">Quest</a> VR headsets that includes several tweaks and improvements.

The video game giant has announced that it&#39;s making a Patents Pledge, which gives rival developers free access to any of its accessibility-related technologies. While not all gameplay mechanics are patented, some companies have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/patents-on-video-game-mechanics-may-strangle-innovation/">taken to</a> making sure competitors aren&#39;t legally allowed to use their technologies. Critics condemn the practice, <a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/the-orcish-patent-how-do-video-game-patents-work-and-should-you-be-protecting-your-ideas/">accusing</a> the companies of stifling creativity and innovation in the industry. EA at least won&#39;t be suing anybody that incorporate its accessibility features in their games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-31-gaming-irl-apex-legends.html">Apex Legends&#39;</a> &quot;ping&quot; system.</p><p>The feature gives players in the same team a way to communicate with each other without using voice chat. They can simply tap buttons to tell their teammates where they are on a map, to alert others of a threat or to tag targets. Supposedly, Epic Games borrowed <em>Apex&#39;s</em> ping system for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-28-fornite-season-eight-apex-legends-sea-of-thieves-theme.html"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. The Patents Pledge also covers at least four more EA features, three of which make video games more accessible to players with vision issues. Those technologies, already in use in the <em>Madden NFL</em> and <em>FIFA</em> franchises, can automatically detect colors and then modify their brightness and contrast to make them more visible.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last patent in the five EA specifically mentioned covers a technology allowing players with hearing issues to modify or create their own music. EA says it will add any future accessibility patents to the pledge and that it hopes the move can &quot;encourage others to build new features that make video games more inclusive.&quot;</p><p>Chris Bruzzo, EA&#39;s EVP of Positive Play, Commercial and Marketing, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At Electronic Arts, our mission is to inspire the world to play. We can only make that a reality if our video games are accessible to all players. Our accessibility team has long been committed to breaking down barriers within our video games, but we realize that to drive meaningful change, we need to work together as an industry to do better for our players.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first. We welcome collaboration with others on how we move the industry forward together.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ea-patents-pledge-accessibility-070041114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e1badee-113e-480e-b823-f45cfe026e00</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 07:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629788282</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T06:58:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c03b1a20-04a0-11ec-bfec-c97d5123a528" width="1454" height="818" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c03b1a20-04a0-11ec-bfec-c97d5123a528" width="1454" height="818" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apex Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apex Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX has already shipped 100,000 Starlink satellite internet terminals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html">Starlink</a> has already shipped 100,000 satellite internet terminals before it has even achieved global coverage.

The terminal itself isn&#39;t included in the monthly fee: Starlink sells its starter kit with the user terminal or antenna dish, its stand and power supply, as well as a WiFi router for an additional $499, which customers will have to pay up front. You can see what the terminal looks like in the image above, showing a dish installed on the roof of a school in Chile.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Starlink was designed to serve customers in remote locations where internet options are typically limited or even non-existent. Perhaps that&#39;s why customers are willing to pay the rather steep upfront cost. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/23/elon-musk-spacex-has-shipped-100000-starlink-terminals.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the company reported having 90,000 users in July, indicating that it signed up 10,000 more customers within just a few weeks.</p><p>The service uses thousands of small satellites in orbit to provide internet connection to its customers. SpaceX already deployed almost 1,800 satellites for the Starlink constellation, but it has plans to launch up to 42,000 small internet satellites in the future. Company president Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">previously said</a> that Starlink will be able to offer continuous global coverage once all the deployed satellites reach their operational orbit, which could happen as soon as September.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">959284fd-12c1-4ccf-926e-b25ef0535c53</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 05:18:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629782303</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T05:18:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b992cf80-0494-11ec-bfef-80438b1ca9c0" width="2970" height="1980" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b992cf80-0494-11ec-bfef-80438b1ca9c0" width="2970" height="1980" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PABLO COZZAGLIO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[View of an antenna of the Starlink satellite internet at the Jhon F.

In hopes of making those more useful for everyone, Google plans to make <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/08/making-ratings-and-reviews-better-for.html">two tweaks to the Play Store</a>.</p><p>Starting in November, the ratings you see will be based on where you live. So, for example, if your device is registered to Japan, you will first see what other Japanese users think of the app you’re about to download. Then, sometime early next year, Google plans to further tweak Play Store ratings to better reflect the device you’re using, be that a phone, tablet, foldable, Chromebook or smartwatch. “This will give users a better impression of the experience that they can expect for the device they’re using,” the company says of the change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In part, Google is making these tweaks to help developers.

The Playdate has a 180MHz CPU supported by 16MB of memory and 4GB of flash storage.

According to iFixit, Panic and Teenage Engineering embedded a cylindrical magnet into the shaft of the component. That magnet works in conjunction with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect">Hull effect</a> sensor to trigger an input from the crank. It&#39;s a simple but effective design that should last. &quot;One thing this crank won&#39;t do? Drift.

A charming sticker iFixit found upon opening the device said &quot;breaking,&quot; not removing, the components would void the warranty. Many of the internals most likely to fail first, including the battery and headphone jack, were either modular or easily accessible.

Before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twelve-minutes-cast-daisy-ridley-james-mcavoy-191952478.html">gained an all-star cast</a> including Daisy Ridley, James McAvoy and Willem Dafoe, it was an intriguing indie point-and-click adventure with a Groundhog&#39;s Day-esque time loop and a unique, top-down perspective. Its interactive narrative, combined with a wealth of cinematic influences, made it seem as if developer Luis Antonio was crafting something meant just for me.</p><p>That&#39;s pretty much how I felt at the beginning of the game. You play as a man who comes home to a small apartment. Your wife has some special news, which you celebrate over a romantic dinner. All of a sudden, a cop starts pounding on the door and accuses her of murder. Things go downhill fast, and in an instant you&#39;re right back to the beginning of the night. Your mission: Figure out what the hell is happening.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0d6446c6482a408d8891f65e0f13afa2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uob80LBVgzA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Sounds like a solid thriller, right? But after spending six hours with the game, I was furious. What started out as a fun mystery devolved into a repetitive slog. I was forced to abuse my seemingly lovely wife. Sometimes I had to watch her be repeatedly tortured by that sadistic cop. And I became a murderer myself, several times over. Making things even worse, my reward for that hellish journey was an array of twists so convoluted, so mind-numbingly <em>dumb</em>, I was angry about it for days. Say what you will about the works of M. Night Shyamalan, but at least his twists feel original. (And yes, I know those twists occur less often than you may think.)</p><p>I won&#39;t spoil where <em>Twelve Minutes</em> ultimately goes. And, to be honest, I&#39;m hesitant to even point out that a story has twists at all. But for a mystery like this, I figure that&#39;s to be expected. All of this time looping detective work just has to lead to something truly dramatic! And it&#39;s clear that Luis Antonio genuinely wants to blow your mind. It&#39;s just a shame almost everything falls flat at the end.</p><p>That&#39;s not to say <em>Twelve Minutes</em> isn&#39;t worth playing. The game&#39;s early hours set up a fascinating mystery box. Your small apartment has a cramped kitchen and living space, a bathroom, a bathroom and a closet. That&#39;s it. Everything you need to complete the game is there (or gets there later). Some of those puzzle pieces feel organic, like the mugs that you can fill with water, or the large knife tempting you in the kitchen. Some of them, like the light switch that can electrocute people on cue, are hilariously convenient.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d6e036d1a5e446f7a62a31d9bc3567f9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2324c80-0448-11ec-acba-508673d807a5" alt="Twelve Minutes" data-uuid="431ab93f-06b2-3e4b-8c48-f58f7e007ec2"></section><p>I realized <em>Twelve Minutes</em> was doing something special early on when it managed to work its way into my subconscious. I thought of new things to try during long walks and after sleeping on a particularly annoying problem. That&#39;s a sign that, for a while at least, I was genuinely invested in the story. It helps that <em>Twelve Minutes </em>also has some solid voice work, which goes a long way toward connecting you to the characters. You don&#39;t get a full look at anyone&#39;s face (even if you try to scope out the cop through your front door&#39;s peephole), so it&#39;s nice to have some human performances grounding the story. If you’ve got Xbox Game Pass, it’s worth checking out the game just to experience its first few hours.</p><p>After the novelty wears off, though, the game quickly takes a turn for the worse. Eventually, you&#39;ll have to complete a long series of tasks over and over until you figure out your next step. And sometimes that can mean doing the same five tasks dozens of times. <em>Twelve Minutes</em> gives you a few easy ways to speed things up, like a single dialog option that can prove you&#39;re actually going through a time loop and that she&#39;s genuinely in danger. But a few more narrative shortcuts would make the game&#39;s rough last act more tolerable.</p><p>One major moment gives you only a few seconds to show one character a specific item. It&#39;s easy to miss that&#39;s something you can even do. And even when I <em>knew</em> what I had to do, after looking up a few guides, I still failed to trigger the right interaction several times. At that point, the game began to feel less like a puzzle I needed to solve and more like a <em>Saw</em> trap that I needed to escape from.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b22ddfb0-0448-11ec-bcde-748f758bb26b" style="height:844;width:1522;" alt="Twelve Minutes" data-uuid="5df6e309-561c-3b55-9a33-53ffba2f763a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Annapurna Interactive</div></figure><p>I suppose these issues could be overlooked if <em>Twelve Minutes</em> had a better script, but even in that respect it fails. It&#39;s stronger toward the beginning, but like a J.J. Abrams story, it has no clear idea where to go at the end. Characters start to act in completely different ways, which is hard to swallow after seeing them in one light for several hours. A sympathetic turn for Dafoe&#39;s cop feels particularly out of place, after seeing multiple loops where he kills you and your wife, and that’s even <em>after </em>getting the MacGuffin he&#39;s looking for. You don&#39;t need to have an ACAB tattoo to call him a monster.</p><p>I wouldn&#39;t write off <em>Twelve Minutes</em> a bad game, but based on where the story goes, it’s ultimately disappointing. Luis Antonio and his team spent over seven years working on the game, and it&#39;s a shame to see my enthusiasm for it fall apart in six hours.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twelve-minutes-review-game-200045769.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6e1dc40-7d9a-4fb0-ae09-723769734ca0</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 20:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629748386</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T19:53:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2275000-0448-11ec-ae7b-1592bff081c5" width="1849" height="986" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b2275000-0448-11ec-ae7b-1592bff081c5" width="1849" height="986" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Annapurna Interactive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twelve Minutes]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twelve Minutes]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku revives former Quibi original 'Most Dangerous Game' for a second season]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this month, Roku released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-adds-more-quibi-shows-to-original-144530038.html">last of the TV shows</a> and movies it acquired when Quibi shut down at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-shut-down-155124687.html">end of 2020</a>.

At the start of July, a copy of <em>The Legend of Zelda </em>went for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-legend-of-zelda-auction-193914155.html">$870,000</a><em>. </em>Days later, a mint version of <em>Super Mario 64 </em>sold for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-mario-64-record-auction-110510247.html">$1.56 million</a>. Now another Nintendo collectible has set a sales record, but this one is a bit different.</p><div id="db06779491604c5296c1e145b9949df7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">About this Game &amp; Watch, yes it is extremely rare, and comparred to some other recent video game prices, the final price paid is very low. This piece is museum level (1/3) <a href="https://t.co/aKsDgbMDcP">https://t.co/aKsDgbMDcP</a></p>— Beforemario (@beforemario) <a href="https://twitter.com/beforemario/status/1429224778347524099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Over the weekend, a special commemorative edition of a Game &amp; Watch system sold for approximately $9,100 on Yahoo Japan. As most Nintendo fans know, the Game &amp; Watch predates the far more successful <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-21-nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary.html">Game Boy</a>. What makes this unit unique is that it was commissioned by Game &amp; Watch creator Gunpei Yokoi after Nintendo sold more than 20,000 million units of the handheld. Before this weekend, this version of the console had never come on the market before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What’s unclear is just how many units of the commemorative edition Game Nintendo produced. <a href="https://twitter.com/beforemario/status/1429224778347524099?s=20">According to Beforemario</a>, a <a href="http://blog.beforemario.com/">blog</a> devoted to games and toys the company made between the 1960s and 1980s, the unit is “extremely” rare. “If I had to guess, I would say there were more than three made [one for each of the individuals pictured on the plaque], but again, just a guess,” John Hardie, the director of the <a href="http://nvmusa.org/">National Videogame Museum</a> in Fresco, Texas, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/rare-nintendo-game-watch-unit-fetches-9000-at-auction/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social">told Ars Technica</a><em>.</em></p><p>Given the current state of the video game collectibles market, what seems like a one-of-a-kind historical artifact selling for so little is surprising. Part of that could be the result of the Game &amp; Watch market. As <em>Ars Technica</em> points out, you can find common versions of the handheld for about $50. Rarer variants like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYSJ33UpFrs&amp;ab_channel=BalloonFightWiki">Ballon Fight</a> one can go for as much as $2,000 if they’re in good condition.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/commemorative-game-and-watch-auction-sale-174356767.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf23becf-7a56-4ec4-8ad8-6f6837bf04ce</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:43:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629740640</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T17:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5bfdeb90-0438-11ec-8ebf-b6ece5500ae1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5bfdeb90-0438-11ec-8ebf-b6ece5500ae1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Beforemario]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Game & Watch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Game & Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data leak exposed 38 million records, including COVID-19 vaccination statuses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Around 38 million records from north of a thousand web apps that use Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-first-gpt-3-feature-coding-business-apps-122557556.html">Power Apps portals platform</a> were left exposed online, according to researchers. The records are said to have included data from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19">COVID-19</a> contact tracing efforts, vaccine registrations and employee databases, such as home addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers and vaccination status.</p><p>Data from some large companies and institutions was exposed in the incident, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed/#"><em>Wired</em></a><em>,</em> including American Airlines, Ford, the <a href="https://events.in.gov/event/state_notifying_hoosiers_about_improper_access_of_contact_tracing_information">Indiana Department of Health</a> and New York City public schools. The vulnerability has mostly been resolved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers from security company Upguard started looking into the issue in May. They found data from many Power Apps portals that was supposed to be private was available for anyone to access if they knew where to look.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/">Power Apps service</a> aims to make it easy for customers to make their own web and mobile apps. It offers application programming interfaces (APIs) for developers to use with the data they collect. However, Upguard found that using those APIs makes the data obtained through Power Apps Portals public by default, and manual reconfiguration was required to keep the information private.</p><p>Upguard <a href="https://www.upguard.com/breaches/power-apps">says</a> it sent a vulnerability report to the Microsoft Security Resource Center on June 24th, including links to Power Apps portals accounts on which sensitive data was exposed and steps to identify APIs that enabled anonymous access to data. Researchers worked with Microsoft to clarify how to reproduce the issue. However, an Microsoft analyst told the firm on June 29th that the case was closed and they “determined that this behavior is considered to be by design.”</p><p>Upguard then started notifying some of the affected companies and organizations, which moved to lock down their data. It raised an abuse report with Microsoft on July 15th. By July 19th, the company says that most of the data from the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/overview">Power Apps portals</a> in question, including the most sensitive information, had been made private.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft provided us with the following statement after this story was first published: &quot;<em>Our products provide customers flexibility and privacy features to design scalable solutions that meet a wide variety of needs. We take security and privacy seriously, and we encourage our customers to use best practices when configuring products in ways that best meet their privacy needs.&quot;</em></p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/important-changes-deprecations#table-permission-changes-for-forms-and-lists-on-new-portals">said</a> Power Apps portals apps will keep data private by default when developers harness the APIs. In addition, it released <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/admin/portal-checker-analysis">a tool</a> for developers to check their settings.</p><p>There&#39;s no indication as yet that any of the exposed data has been compromised. Among the most sensitive information that was left in the open were 332,000 email addresses and Microsoft employee IDs that are used for payroll, according to Upguard. The company also says that more than 39,000 records from portals related to Microsoft Mixed Reality were exposed, including users&#39; names and email addresses.</p><p>The incident underscores the fact that a misconfiguration, no matter how seemingly minor, could lead to serious data breaches. That doesn&#39;t appear to be the case here, thankfully. Still, it goes to show that developers should probably triple check their settings, especially when plugging in an API they haven&#39;t designed themselves.</p><p><strong>Update 8/23 3:45PM ET: </strong>Added a statement from Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Update 8/23 4:30PM ET:</strong> Clarified that the issue concerned Power Apps portals, and not Power Apps as a whole.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c324299-0375-4afb-a07d-6062c8e522ce</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 16:54:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629750927</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T20:35:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01cf42d0-0439-11ec-8f3d-30c7cc737ca4" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01cf42d0-0439-11ec-8f3d-30c7cc737ca4" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images/iStockphoto]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Broken red lock security concept on a wall with blue padlocks in a row composed of a rectangle pattern]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Broken lock security concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Poly Network says it has recovered all $610 million it lost in cryptocurrency heist]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most unusual cryptocurrency heists in recent memory has come to a close.

Verizon (Engadget&#39;s parent company) has offered free subscriptions to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-22-verizon-disney-plus-12-months-free.html">Disney+</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-16-verizon-unlimited-apple-music.html">Apple Music</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/verizon-amc-plus-bonus-offer-142542376.html">AMC+</a> recently, while T-Mobile has long offered its customers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-06-t-mobile-family-plans-include-free-netflix.html">free Netflix access</a>. Today, T-Mobile is <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005377/en/T-Mobile-is-Giving-Customers-One-Year-of-Apple-TV-on-Us/">adding another freebie</a> to its offerings: Apple TV+. Starting on August 25th, customers on the carrier&#39;s Magenta or Magenta Max plans (as well as some Sprint legacy plans) will get one year of free Apple TV+ access.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re already paying for Apple TV+, you can still take advantage of this deal. It&#39;ll just add a free year of access and pause billing until the trial is up. If you haven&#39;t used Apple TV+ yet, it is naturally available on basically all current Apple hardware, but it&#39;s also available on a pretty large number of third-party set-top boxes, gaming consoles and TVs, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This move comes as Apple itself has cut back on the length of its Apple TV+ free trials. Ever since the service launched, Apple offered a year free to basically anyone who bought new hardware from the company, and it extended that free period multiple times. But lately, people have noticed that Apple is finally charging them for the service, and the free trial period has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-reduced-july-1-105546762.html">cut down to three months</a>. That&#39;s still quite generous, but all these changes indicate Apple is keen to start collecting money for Apple TV+. Unless, of course, you&#39;re a T-Mobile subscriber, in which case it&#39;s a perfect time to start your <em>Ted Lasso</em> binge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-apple-tv-plus-free-year-subscription-150820950.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c42ffa9-455c-4c8b-9fea-83481578b1c1</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:08:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629731303</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T15:08:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7de29310-0423-11ec-9fd7-da06f23899fc" width="5000" height="3231" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7de29310-0423-11ec-9fd7-da06f23899fc" width="5000" height="3231" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kevin Winter via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - JULY 15: Jason Sudeikis attends Apple's "Ted Lasso" season two premiere at Pacific Design Center on July 15, 2021 in West Hollywood, California.

The third-person shooter has <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-believes-outriders-xbox-game-pass-launch-has-paid-off/"><ins>become a hit</ins></a> for the publisher (though that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/outriders-copies-sold-royalties-square-enix"><ins>hasn&#39;t been reflected in royalties for the developer</ins></a>, People Can Fly.) It&#39;s easy to see why: the core gameplay is bags of fun, especially when you’re playing with friends.</p><p>However, it doesn&#39;t quite stick the landing. A by-the-numbers story and limited replayability drag things down a bit. As such, before you pay full price, it might be worth checking out <em>Outriders </em>on Xbox Game Pass first.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ace63731452346789c3f2333100b31d8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPongqgu4H0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>You play as an Outrider, an elite soldier who helps prepare another planet for what&#39;s left of humanity to colonize it, but something goes drastically wrong. Get past the middling first couple of hours (and some iffy writing and acting), and <em>Outriders</em> kicks into a higher gear once your character becomes mutated. You can select one of four classes, each with their own set of unlockable abilities.</p><p>The powers and weapon abilities are a blast to play around with, especially when you team up with a friend and combo your special moves. There are a vast number of potential loadouts and character builds you can run with. You can also switch up your gear, abilities and skill tree at any time. The cover system works well enough, but it&#39;s better to play aggressively, since you&#39;ll only heal by killing enemies.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/08100920-01c0-11ec-ade7-a1d693248958" alt="Outriders" data-uuid="be59a1ac-5dc7-3d5c-8130-3e0433f9f508"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">People Can Fly/Square Enix</div></figure><p><em>Outriders</em> looks good, with a grimy tone that’s more <em>Gears of War</em> than <em>Destiny</em>. There are a bunch of different biomes, each with a distinct aesthetic, though many parts of levels are just tunnels that funnel you from one encounter to the next. It’s easy to make comparisons with <em>Destiny 2</em>: Both games are futuristic shooters in which you can mow down waves of enemies and constantly hunt for better gear.</p><p><em>Outriders </em>isn’t a live service game, though, nor can you battle other players. It has a focused story, with side missions and endgame challenges you can go on after you finish the campaign. They do get repetitive, though. At a certain point, grinding for better items means little more than seeing higher numbers on your weapon stats and floating above enemies when you attack them. It might have actually been better as an ongoing game with frequent content additions.</p><section data-eng-breakout="dc0b86cfacef4665888090f737855b56" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0811b6d0-01c0-11ec-afdf-3009a210e3a6" alt="Outriders" data-uuid="4a9e6638-e0ee-3ee5-8771-789e44fef402"></section><p>Still, there&#39;s nothing to lose by checking out <em>Outriders</em> on Xbox Game Pass, where it has been available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/outriders-xbox-game-pass-release-date-163532612.html"><ins>since its launch day</ins></a>.</p><p>For at least the last year or so, there’s been a common refrain about Xbox Game Pass: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-xbox-games-gamepass-150012014.html"><ins>it’s one of the best deals in gaming</ins></a>. There’s definitely some merit to that, as the service includes a ton of major first-party games, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-182723995.html"><em><ins>Microsoft Flight Simulator</ins></em></a>, as well as Bethesda titles and a bunch of killer indies for a single monthly fee. Offering players easier access to Game Pass <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-could-gaming-ios-web-215045999.html"><ins>on more devices</ins></a> through the cloud sweetens the deal.</p><p>Big third-party games are an important aspect of the service as well, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-november-10-december-135548415.html"><ins>a bunch of EA titles games</ins></a> and, of course, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/outriders-xbox-game-pass-release-date-163532612.html"><em><ins>Outriders</ins></em></a>, which is practically a perfect fit for Game Pass.</p><p>Square Enix and People Can Fly deserve props for putting out a lengthy <em>Outriders</em> demo that’s long enough for you to get a good sense of each classes’ powers. If you have Game Pass Ultimate, though, you can keep going without having to pay extra.</p><p><em>Outriders </em>is solid. It&#39;s exactly the kind of thing Microsoft could use more of on Game Pass, a fun, big third-party game you might be interested in, but don&#39;t want to spend $60 on. Sure, the library has plenty of far better games, but whenever you and a couple of buddies are in the mood for some relatively mindless alien-murdering carnage without having to fire up <em>Destiny 2</em> yet again, <em>Outriders</em> hits the spot.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/outriders-xbox-game-pass-irl-150014907.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d7f0749e-b6c5-4748-8d07-7af3ac6f3f7b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629728082</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T14:14:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/081894a0-01c0-11ec-97fd-04efd3f69068" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/081894a0-01c0-11ec-97fd-04efd3f69068" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[People Can Fly/Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Outriders]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Outriders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virgin Orbit is going public to fund its space satellite program]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/virgin%20orbit"><ins>Virgin Orbit</ins></a> has announced plans to go public on the Nasdaq stock exchange through a special purpose acquisitions company (SPAC) merger.

In July, it sought fans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-pro-lab-182246111.html">test an upcoming model</a> without disclosing too many details. Fast forward a few weeks, and the company has formally revealed the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:OnePlus Buds Pro" href="https://fave.co/3Ba807L">OnePlus Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>OnePlus has adopted a different design from the original Buds, which it released last year. The Buds Pro boast adaptive noise cancellation (ANC), which filters out background sound levels of up to 40dB. You can lower that to a maximum of 25dB to keep closer tabs on your surroundings. There&#39;s a scene detection feature too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Each earbud has a trio of microphones. OnePlus says the mics work in concert with its noise reduction algorithms and a mechanical design intended to tamp down wind noise. All of those features are included with the aim of delivering clearer audio.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also a feature called OnePlus Audio ID, a sound profile that customizes each song based on the wearer&#39;s sensitivity to different sounds, as established by a listening test. You can expect Dolby Atmos support too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bb545d10-fa09-11eb-bebd-29cec944b194" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro" data-uuid="1cc9a813-8f3d-3769-b389-50c394e74d13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>You&#39;ll get up to seven hours of use on a single charge, and five hours if ANC is enabled, OnePlus says. The charging case can add up to 31 hours of playback time, and an extra 23 hours if you use ANC. Fast charging adds 10 hours of playback after 10 minutes of charging time via a USB-C cable. The case is also Qi-certified for wireless charging.</p><p>The earbuds are IP55-rated for water and sweat resistance, while the charging case is IPX4-rated. Other features include low latency for gaming on certain OnePlus phones (around 94ms), fast pairing, voice assistant support, automatic pausing when you take the buds out of your ears and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">Zen mode</a> that can play white noise.</p><p>The original $79 OnePlus Buds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-hands-on-specs-price-availability-143007708.html">didn&#39;t exactly blow us away</a>. Engadget Senior News Editor Billy Steele found the AirPods-style earbuds delivered muddy audio and were uncomfortable to wear. Here&#39;s hoping OnePlus has upped its game this time around.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:OnePlus Buds Pro" href="https://fave.co/3Ba807L">OnePlus Buds Pro</a> will go on sale in the US and Canada on September 1st in two colors: Matte Black and Glossy White.

To celebrate the Rover’s ninth — <em>ninth!</em> — year surveying the red planet, the clip shows off where the Rover has been, where it’s going, and what we’ve learned in the last decade. This includes the breathtaking fact that, on a clear winter’s day when there’s no dust in the air, you can see close to 20 miles.</p><div id="680d6f1ca7b242f6a4ae37463eb8e777"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8DZl56tS9ko?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The panorama, as reported by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/go-on-a-panoramic-video-tour-of-mars-with-the-curiosity-1847533377"><em>Gizmodo</em></a>, shows Curiosity’s journey up the side of Mount Sharp, and the detour it had to take in order to avoid a large sheet of Martian sand. As the rover has journeyed up the side, the composition of the rocks had changed from a clay-rich base to one full of sulphide. As Deputy Project Scientist Abigail Fraeman explains, researchers are hoping to learn a little more about how Mars lost its water (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-08-nasa-mars-gale-lake.html">Gale Crater used to be a lake</a>, after all) and how long it took before it became the dry desert planet we see before us.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-jpl-curiosity-rover-gale-crater-panorama-085647064.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a82cf889-6bfd-4634-8b50-36041035284d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 08:56:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629721226</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T02:31:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/68ec5480-040c-11ec-a75e-03fa1240867f" width="703" height="469" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bf9ce3c0-03ef-11ec-bb7e-38db556d5881" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image taken from a JPL video showing off the interior of the Gale Crater, as shot by the Curiosity Rover.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Excerpt from the Gale Crater ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp could soon have an iPad app for the first time]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Part of WhatsApp&#39;s end-to-end encryption scheme is a requirement for users to set up the service with a phone as the &quot;main&quot; device for an account.
