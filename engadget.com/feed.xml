The company just has to pay administrative fees to secure the patent.</p><p>In a <em>Politico</em> interview, Clearview founder Hoan Ton-That claimed this was the first facial recognition patent involving &quot;large-scale internet data.&quot; The firm sells its tool to government clients (including law enforcement) hoping to accelerate searches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might imagine, there&#39;s a concern the USPTO is effectively blessing Clearview&#39;s technology and giving the company a chance to grow despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-dhs-letter-225404725.html">widespread objections</a> to its technology&#39;s very existence. Critics are concerned Clearview is building image databases without targets&#39; knowledge or permission, and multiple governments (including Australia and the UK) believe the facial recognition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-fined-17-million-for-breaching-uk-data-protection-laws-102806507.html">violates data laws</a>. The tech could theoretically be used to stifle political dissent or, in private use, to stalk other people. That&#39;s not including worries about possible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-amazon-rekognition-facial-analysis-gender-race-bias-mit.html">gender and race biases</a> for facial recognition as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>Ton-That maintained Clearview has no plans to sell to anyone besides government clients, and that it was &quot;important&quot; to have unbiased systems. However, the patent left the door open to non-government purposes, like learning more about a dating partner or business client. Clearview is aware of the problematic path its technology might take, even if it doesn&#39;t intend to head in that direction.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-patent-222347603.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35aa06ac-9b5a-4597-96c2-bffc9d0b8af8</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 22:23:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638656631</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T22:24:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/8c36d6a0-60fc-11e9-bff3-cafa68905d76" width="4909" height="3273" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/8c36d6a0-60fc-11e9-bff3-cafa68905d76" width="4909" height="3273" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Peter / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People walk past a poster simulating facial recognition software at the Security China 2018 exhibition on public safety and security in Beijing, China October 24, 2018.

As <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leaks-revealing-spider-man-1848161056">learned</a>, the game&#39;s official Polish YouTube channel briefly <a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealGalaxyBoi/status/1467063354745257985">shared</a> a Chapter 3 trailer revealing many of the planned changes to the battery royale brawler. You can expect a new island (and new characters, including <em>Gears of War</em>&#39;s Marcus and Kait as well as Spider-Man ‚Äî there even appears to be web-swinging like you&#39;ve seen in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html">Insomniac&#39;s Spider-Man games</a>, not to mention locales like the Daily Bugle.</p><p>Chapter 3 will add some new mechanics on top of fresh weapons and items. You can slide (seen in the Chapter 2 finale), and set up camps to both heal your squad and stash items you can carry over to future matches. And there&#39;s even a degree of star power: The Foundation, a character voiced by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-original-movies-2021-trailer-sizzle-reel-170145846.html">Dwayne Johnson</a>, will carry over from the Chapter 2 shutdown.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear when Chapter 3 debuts. However, Epic wasn&#39;t afraid to repeat history and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-13-fortnite-the-end-event.html">kick players out</a> of <em>Fortnite</em> as the previous chapter came to an end. Chapter 2 closed in dramatic fashion, with The Foundation helping to defeat a Cube Queen invasion and flipping the entire island upside-down. If you stuck with the event, you were left treading water and with no option but to quit the game. Clearly, Epic is betting this dramatic ploy will work a second time.</p><div id="286b7d388e0a45629f96f1de7c7cd644"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW FORTNITE CHAPTER 3 TRAILER LEAKED ONLY WATCH IF YOU WANT TO!! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FortniteChapter3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FortniteChapter3</a><a href="https://t.co/N0SBoJaF4I">pic.twitter.com/N0SBoJaF4I</a></p>‚Äî GalaxyBoiüéÑ‚ùÑÔ∏è (@DaRealGalaxyBoi) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaRealGalaxyBoi/status/1467063354745257985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2021</a></blockquote></div><div id="981815f1b983410b95fb6feec8befe03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Rasl5UwwNY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-chapter-3-trailer-leak-spider-man-213150967.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">059c26c1-8755-45ed-a734-8c8276bcd650</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 21:31:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638712757</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T13:59:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/102928c0-5545-11ec-af9b-8103a5ce5734" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/102928c0-5545-11ec-af9b-8103a5ce5734" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Epic Games/GalaxyBoi, Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spider-Man in 'Fortnite' Chapter 3 leaked trailer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spider-Man in 'Fortnite' Chapter 3 leaked trailer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter mistakenly suspended users after extremists abused its private image policy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you were worried people might abuse Twitter&#39;s new policy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-private-photos-videos-personal-information-privacy-145228097.html">banning non-consensual image sharing</a>, your fears were well-founded. The social network <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-admits-error-in-account-suspensions/">told</a><em>The Washington Post</em> it suspended the accounts of 12 journalists and anti-extremism researchers by mistake after far-right activists and white supremacists sent a &quot;coordinated and malicious&quot; flurry of bogus reports attempting to silence critics. It wasn&#39;t clear how many reports had been sent beyond a &quot;significant amount.&quot;</p><p>The company said it was already reversing bans and had begun an internal review to make sure the policy was used &quot;as intended.&quot; More data on the volume of false accusations would come later. Some of the extremists&#39; targets were still banned as of the <em>Post</em>&#39;s story.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The rule bars users from sharing private photos and videos without the subject&#39;s permission.

Critics were already concerned the measure was too vaguely worded to prevent misuse. It might stifle amateur investigators sifting through readily available data, for instance. While Twitter might not want to overhaul its policy, it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if there were clarifications or tweaks to limit potential abuses going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-private-image-policy-abused-203117985.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d45adf0-6cc9-47e7-b287-9491af493fa0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 20:31:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638649913</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T20:31:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1351b9f0-553a-11ec-bb5f-49c12683dec2" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1351b9f0-553a-11ec-bb5f-49c12683dec2" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2020/10/14: A man wearing a face mask walks past a Twitter logo outside their New York City headquarters.

The missing albums come from stars like Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish and John Mulaney.</p><p>As with earlier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-08-spotify-secret-genius-songwriters.html">songwriter disputes</a>, this latest fight revolves around compensating more than just the performance. Spoken Giants wants its artists to receive royalties as the joke writers, not just for their time behind the microphone. The rights firm started talking to online services in the spring, but learned just before American Thanksgiving that Spotify would pull comedians&#39; work until there was an agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify defended itself in a statement to the <em>Journal</em>. The company said it paid a &quot;significant&quot; amount of money for the comedy material and would &quot;love&quot; to keep paying, and that distributors and labels also had a say regarding payouts. Some material remains from those comedians on Spotify as of this writing, but much more of it is available through rivals like Apple Music.</p><p>It&#39;s not surprising that Spotify would clash with Spoken Giants. If Spotify also had to pay writing royalties, the service would either have to pay more overall (clearly Spoken Giants&#39; ideal outcome) or set aside some of the existing share for distributors and labels. Either could hurt Spotify&#39;s bottom line, and it doesn&#39;t have much breathing room when its average revenue per person was about $4.91 <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/streaming/spot/spotify-earnings-why-the-stock-spiked-on-q3-results">last quarter</a>.</p><p>At the same time, though, the dispute and removal come at a particularly sensitive time. With live standup still far from what it was before the pandemic, some comedians are still highly dependent on albums and other digital releases. They&#39;re clearly eager to improve that income, and may feel some extra pain when they lose the support of a streaming heavyweight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-pulls-comedians-albums-over-royalty-dispute-180042056.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8faa665-6266-45cb-a32f-dc252e922ef0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 18:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638640847</ingested><modified>2021-12-04T18:00:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3311d060-ceb5-11eb-9fff-9dacb49eed6d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3311d060-ceb5-11eb-9fff-9dacb49eed6d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dimitrios Kambouris via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNCASVILLE, CT - OCTOBER 14:  Headliner Kevin Hart performs stand-up comedy at Mohegan Sun as part of the 20th Anniversary Comedy All-Star Gala event at Mohegan Sun on October 14, 2016 in Uncasville, Connecticut.

Steve Dent and a licensed drone pilot toured the French countryside with the help of the DJI Mavic 3 drone, while Terrence O‚ÄôBrien played with the Animoog Z app, a sequel ten years in the making. Also, Cherlynn Low played around with Android 12 to check out its new Material You design.</p><h2>The Mavic 3 is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-review-cinematic-power-at-a-price-150029600.html">easiest DJI drone to fly</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/792be770-5475-11ec-84ff-19101d72dfea" alt="DJI Mavic 3" data-uuid="d1d4c64d-89d1-34e1-8d26-548eaf071023"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent spent some time with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:DJI Mavic 3" href="https://fave.co/3IlHZXa">DJI Mavic 3</a> and a licensed drone pilot in the French countryside to see what the new device is capable of. He reports that not only is the Mavic 3 the easiest DJI drone to fly, but the large 4/3 sensor and dual camera system produce incredible footage ‚Äì and the 46 minutes of range is double the time that the previous model could capture. He tested the standard model in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$3,000 Fly More combo package" href="https://fave.co/3xRgHDm">$3,000 Fly More combo package</a>, which includes three batteries, a charging hub, one set of ND filters and a carrying bag. The Mavic 3 is also available in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cine mode" href="https://fave.co/3IudRcz">Cine mode</a> with a built-in 1TB SSD and Apple ProRes 422 HQ video support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Mavic 3 was easier to maneuver thanks to its improved obstacle avoidance, it was also easy to fold the 899-gram drone into a more compact size for storage and travel. Steve says the camera and video specs are impressive: the primary camera was built in collaboration with Hasselblad and has a 24mm f/2.8-f/11 lens with a color profile for accurate hues. The video camera can shoot 5.1K at 50fps or 4K at 60fps; Steve says the larger sensor provides better low light performance, more detail and great dynamic range. However, there are some downsides ‚Äì namely the price, but also that the additional features that DJI promised (like ActiveTrack5 and QuickShots) aren&#39;t available now but will be released in January. Overall, Steve says the Mavic 3 delivers, but is best for professions and prosumers.</p><h2>Google‚Äôs Material You design gives Android 12 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html">much-needed visual update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/175165c0-5475-11ec-b3e6-937a05f6bfec" alt="Android 12" data-uuid="51bb46ca-3f29-39fe-ae68-c9c126372361"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low knows that the many versions of Android make a review of the core features a bit difficult, but the upgrades on the operating system‚Äôs most recent release make for a refreshing experience and provide more transparency over data and privacy. That‚Äôs largely thanks to the new Material You design that has decluttered the UI and enlarged buttons and sliders, among other things. Cherlynn particularly liked the Privacy Dashboard that informs users when their camera and mic are activated, along with which apps require them. Android 12 also has new indicators for when the camera or mic are actively being used.</p><p>Cherlynn did note some aspects that disappointed her, namely the default way to summon the Google Assistant, and the confusing charts and graphs in the battery and privacy dashboards. She was also excited to try the audio-coupled haptic feedback, but wasn‚Äôt able to find any apps that supported it. Overall, she said that the visual updates in Material You and increased privacy tools made the system feel drastically different ‚Äî in a good way.</p><h2>The Animoog Z app is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-animoog-z-i-os-softsynth-music-app-170019893.html">a proper sequel that took ten years to make</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ced04d20-5474-11ec-affb-662506c56596" alt="Moog Animoog Z" data-uuid="b4d70e70-8332-3705-8173-22918befe6fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O‚ÄôBrien was looking forward to testing out <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/animoog-z">Animoog Z</a>, the follow up to Moog‚Äôs original software instrument which used wavetable synthesis. This sequel to the app has largely the same core Anisotropic Synth Engine, consisting of dozens of waveforms that you can choose from, ranging from samples of analog saw waves to more digital sounds. However, the new release adds a third dimension to the X/Y axis of the original ‚Äî a Z axis that notes can move along.</p><p>Terrence says this gives the new app a bit more depth and room to evolve. He found that certain presets took advantage of the additional modulation path to make more complex and unique sounds. There‚Äôs also a new effects section with a looper, delay, filter and an arpeggiator, plus MPE support. Additionally, Terrence says the redesigned look that the new app has makes it feel more modern and easier to navigate. After testing, he declared the Animoog Z a worthy successor to the groundbreaking original. A limited version is available as a free download, with the full featured version going for a flat $10.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-check-out-android-12s-visual-refresh-170059195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">666717d6-70f3-4172-8c42-33499bdd3325</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638564138</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T20:42:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA will give SpaceX more crewed flights to cover for Boeing's delays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boeing&#39;s continued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-starliner-test-flight-delayed-2022-164715835.html">Starliner delays</a> have prompted NASA to hedge its bets. <em>SpaceNews</em><a href="https://spacenews.com/nasa-to-award-spacex-three-more-commercial-crew-flights/">reports</a> NASA <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/12/03/nasa-to-secure-additional-commercial-crew-transportation/">plans to order</a> as many as three more crewed SpaceX flights to ensure &quot;uninterrupted&quot; US trips to the International Space Station as soon as 2023.

Starliner plays a key role in Boeing&#39;s commercial spaceflight program and, unofficially, serves as proof the transportation veteran can compete with a fast-moving &#39;newcomer&#39; like SpaceX in the private space race.

These patterns can be thought of as questions: Why does a particular pattern occur? Why when one releases a ball does the ball fall and fall faster the farther it has fallen? Explanations of those raw patterns come a level below in the hierarchy, and can be thought of as answers to those questions: Galileo‚Äôs sixteenth-century explanation of the observed distance-versus-time pattern was that the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time. But this answer, or explanation, becomes itself another question: Why do the velocities of falling balls increase linearly with time? This question begs a deeper explanation, a deeper answer: Newton‚Äôs explanation was that gravity is a force, that uniform forces cause uniform acceleration, and that uniform acceleration causes linear increases in velocity. Scientific understanding is always incomplete, of course, so there is always a point at which we have no deeper explanation. This in no way detracts from the power of the explanations that do exist: science seeks proximate whys but does not insist on ultimate whys. The general theory of relativity explains Newton‚Äôs laws of gravity, even if its own origin is yet to be explained.</p><p>In technology, at the top of the hierarchy are human-desired functions. These functions present problems that are solved by forms below them in the hierarchy. Forms fulfill functions, but those forms present new problems that must be solved at successively deeper levels. Shifting from the problem-solution nomenclature to the equivalent question-answer nomenclature, we can say that the iPhone represented a technological question: How do we create an Internet-capable cellular phone with a software-programmable interactive display? A partial answer came in the form of multi touch capacitive surfaces, opening up a significant design space for user interaction when multiple fingers are used simultaneously. But the opaqueness of existing multitouch surfaces itself became a question: How do we make multi touch surfaces transparent so that the display is visible? The multi touch transparent surface display provided an answer.</p><p>In other words, science and technology are both organized into hierarchies of question-and-answer pairs, with any question or answer having two ‚Äúfaces.‚Äù One face, pointing downward in the hierarchy, represents a question to an answer just below it in the hierarchy. The other face, pointing upward in the hierarchy, represents an answer to a question just above it in the hierarchy. We emphasize that our depiction of questions as ‚Äúabove‚Äù answers and answers as ‚Äúbelow‚Äù questions is arbitrary ‚Äî it does not signify relative importance or value but is simply intended to be consistent with common usage. In science, an explanation is deeper and more ‚Äúfoundational‚Äù than the fact it explains, especially if it generalizes to explanations of many other facts. Special relativity is, in that sense, deeper than the constancy of c because it answers the question of why c is constant; it also answers the question of how much energy is released during nuclear fission and fusion. In technology, forms are deeper and more ‚Äúfoundational‚Äù than the functions they fulfill, especially if they have been adapted to fulfill many other functions. The multi touch transparent surface display is more foundational than the iPhone because it not only helps answer the question of how to create the iPhone, but also helps answer the question of how to create human-interactive displays in general. Rubber is more foundational than a bicycle tire because it not only helps answer the question of how to create a bicycle tire, but also helps answer the question of how to create a myriad of other kinds of tires.</p><h3>The Network Is Modular: Facilitating Exploitation and Exploration</h3><p>Closely related scientific questions and answers are organized into what we might call scientific domains, which we will refer to as scientific knowledge modules. Closely interacting technological problems and solutions are organized into engineered components, which we will refer to as technological knowledge modules.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/038d8cb0-545e-11ec-b0af-f970a83638da" style="height:463;width:735;" alt="fig 2-2" data-uuid="c9083205-5dc8-3e86-a418-93e62299de7a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard University Press</div></figure><p>Closely related scientific questions are often answerable within a scientific knowledge domain, or scientific knowledge module, drawing on multiple subdomains nested within the larger domain. A question related to some electron transport phenomenon in a particular semiconductor structure lies in the broad domain of semiconductor science but the answer might require an integrated understanding of both the subdomain of electron transport physics as well as the subdomain of the materials science of the synthesized structure. The subquestion associated with electron transport physics might require an integrated understanding of the subdomain of electrons in various kinds of structures (bulk materials, heterojunctions, nanostructures, coupled nanostructures) and of the sub-subdomains of interactions of electrons with phonons in those structures. The subquestion associated with the materials science of the synthesized structure might require an understanding of the sub-subdomains of substrates and epitaxy, thin films, or post materials synthesis fabrication. In other words, we can think of scientific knowledge domains as a modular hierarchy, and think of its subdomains as submodules and sub-submodules.</p><p>Closely related technological problems, likewise, are often solved by key technological components, or technological knowledge modules, perhaps integrating multiple subcomponents nested within the larger components. An iPhone is a component itself composed of many subcomponents, and each subcomponent is similarly subdivided. We can think of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of the iPhone as a component that is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù by its subcomponents ‚Äî an enclosure, a display, a printed circuit board, a camera, and input / output ports. We can think of the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of a printed circuit board as a subcomponent that is ‚Äúsolved‚Äù by sub-components that include low-power integrated circuit chips. Conversely, an iPhone is also a component that is itself nested in a hierarchy of use functions. An iPhone might be used as a solution to the problem of ‚Äúrunning‚Äù a text-messaging app; a text-messaging app might be used as a solution to the problem of sending a mass text message to a friend group; the mass text message might be used as a solution to the problem of organizing the friend group into a protest in Times Square; and the protest in Times Square might be part of a solution to the problem of organizing a wider social movement for some human-desired social cause.</p><p>One might ask: Why is scientific and technological knowledge modular? They are modular because they are complex adaptive systems ‚Äî systems sustained by and adapted to their environment by complex internal changes ‚Äî and virtually all complex adaptive systems are modular (Simon, 1962). Complex adaptive systems both exploit their environments and explore their environments to improve that exploitation. Modularity enables efficiency, both in the exploitation of existing knowledge about the environment and exploration of that environment to create new knowledge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-genesis-of-technoscientific-revolutions-narayanmurti-tsao-harvard-press-163025911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fcee4b1-e8d0-4f63-b108-17c5b1e039e5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 16:30:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638553332</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:42:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20f16f90-5460-11ec-8f31-64a31fc82b7c" width="5316" height="3534" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 10: Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller talks about the new iPhone 11 Pro during a special event on September 10, 2019 in the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's Cupertino, California campus.

In the wake of a <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/">report</a> raising questions about Activision Blizzard&#39;s involvement at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/game-awards-nominees-2021-180501577.html">2021 Game Awards</a>, producer Geoff Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264">confirmed</a> the publisher wouldn&#39;t have a role at the show outside of the nominations chosen by influencers and media. There&#39;s &quot;no place&quot; for abuse and harassment anywhere, Keighley <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008291582537732">said</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;He <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008292660527105">added</a> that the industry needed to &quot;work together&quot; to create a more inclusive space for developing games. The focus was on celebrating games and the people who made them, <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467008293860429825">according</a> to the founder. Keighley already said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-diablo-4-212039519.html"><em>Diablo IV</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em></a> wouldn&#39;t appear during the presentation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear if the scandal had a direct impact on Activision&#39;s presence, but it&#39;s a contrast from 2020.

We saw a bunch go on sale for Black Friday, but now Wellbots is having a sale on one of Roomba&#39;s most advanced models. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Roomba s9+</a> is $200 off right now when you use the code <strong>ENGADGET200</strong> at checkout, so you&#39;ll end up paying $899 for the machine ‚Äî that&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen it and even cheaper than it was last month during Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm" id="dc1aea0b3953401b946029fd82d9c642" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Roomba s9+ at Wellbots - $899</a><p>The s9+ is even more advanced than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">new Roomba j7+</a> that came out recently, although it does not have Precision Vision Navigation like the latter. Instead, the S9+ has the most suction power of any Roomba along with dual multi-surface brushes and Direct Detect technology, the latter of which helps the vacuum focus on the dirtiest spots in your home until they&#39;re fully clean. &quot;Power-lift suction&quot; also helps it deep clean carpets and suck up pet hair. It has sensors to help it move around objects like chairs and tablets and, thanks to its mapping technology, you can have it clean only certain rooms or areas of your home if you wish.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This model also has the clean base that comes with other more expensive Roombas. After each job, the s9+ will automatically return to its base for a recharge, and it will empty its bin into the clean base, which is basically an attached garbage can. That means you don&#39;t have to fuss with the vacuum every time you run it, and you&#39;ll only have to empty the clean base once every 60 days. That combined with the robot&#39;s easy-to-use companion app makes it a premium convenience machine ‚Äî if you use iRobot&#39;s mobile app to start or schedule cleanings, you may not even have to touch the s9+ for weeks at a time while it does its job.</p><p>Even on sale, the Roomba s9+ is a big purchase ‚Äî but it may be worth it for those who hate vacuuming and want their homes to be as clean as possible without having to do much themselves. There are plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget options</a>, though, if you&#39;d rather save a good chunk of money and still get the benefits of a robot vacuum. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3EuUai0">Roomba 694</a> is a good option, as well as the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker RoboVac 11S" href="https://amzn.to/3ogWvaP">Anker RoboVac 11S</a>. The former can be controlled via a mobile app while the latter comes with a remote that lets you maneuver the vacuum like a toy car in addition to setting schedules and the like.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-s9-plus-vacuum-with-clean-base-is-200-off-right-now-150049330.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2debba16-749f-4ea9-8e66-f7b10c2311e3</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2021 15:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638475947</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T20:12:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/03538f70-3591-11eb-9f3b-ab8c466c220a" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s Roomba s9+ vacuum with clean base is $200 off right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tour the White House's Christmas decorations on Google Street View]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now take a tour of the White House&#39;s halls decked with Christmas trees and other decor fit for the season ‚Äî virtually, that is.

A report from <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/03/twitter-agrawal-restructuring/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> states that Agrawal announced a &quot;major reorganization of the company&quot; today, including exits by Michael Montano and Dantley Davis, who led <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikemontano">engineering</a> and design, respectively.</p><p>Twitter confirmed the reorganization to Engadget. A spokesperson said &quot;Parag is focused on operational excellence and setting Twitter up to hit its goals; these changes were made with that in mind.&quot; The changes include moving to a &quot;General Manager model&quot; for teams in the product and technology organizations, which will mean having one person lead the work in those divisions. &quot;This will allow us to operate more cross-functionally and enable faster, more informed decision-making,&quot; the spokesperson added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Davis earlier today <a href="https://twitter.com/dantley/status/1466636819383025666">tweeted </a>a picture from a team offsite, saying: &quot;It was the highlight of the past two years at Twitter for me.

The company is planning to merge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20plus/">PlayStation Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20now/">PlayStation Now</a> into a new offering, which is expected to debut this spring, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>The service, which is codenamed Spartacus, would likely be available on PS4 and PS5 for a monthly fee. It&#39;s unclear whether players would be able to access it on other devices, though the report notes Sony is putting more resources into cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate allows players to delve into more than 100 Xbox titles via the cloud on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html"><ins>consoles</ins></a>, PC, phones and tablets. Microsoft plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html"><ins>make game streaming sticks</ins></a> for TVs too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It seems Sony will kill off PlayStation Now, but keep the PlayStation Plus branding. Sony may not yet have finalized how Spartacus will work, but there could be three tiers to the service. According to documents viewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the lowest tier would effectively be PlayStation Plus as it is now. The second level would add a &quot;large catalog&quot; of PS4 titles, with PS5 games joining later. The third and highest tier would include cloud gaming, expanded demos and, akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html"><ins>Nintendo Switch Online</ins></a>, a bunch of older PS1, PS2, PS3 and even PSP games. However, those plans may not be set in stone.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear whether Sony plans to bring its first-party exclusives to the service on their release date, as Microsoft does on Game Pass. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console"><ins>said last year</ins></a> that the company wouldn&#39;t &quot;go down the road of putting new release titles into a subscription model. These games cost many millions of dollars, well over $100 million, to develop. We just don&#39;t see that as sustainable.&quot;</p><p>But the landscape has shifted since Ryan&#39;s remarks. For one thing, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">Microsoft bought Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media</a> this year. All of Bethesda&#39;s games (save for a couple of timed PS5 console exclusives like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Deathloop/"><em><ins>Deathloop</ins></em></a>) are on Game Pass, and future Bethesda titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/starfield/"><em><ins>Starfield</ins></em></a> might not come to PlayStation at all.</p><p>Although Game Pass would likely be Sony&#39;s biggest competitor in the game subscription market, it&#39;ll be up against several other major companies. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ea%20play/"><ins>EA</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-game-streaming-amazon-luna-google-stadia-160227004.html"><ins>Ubisoft</ins></a> have subscription services, Amazon launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20luna/"><ins>Luna</ins></a> last year and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-iphone-ipad-ios-182421405.html"><ins>Netflix added games</ins></a> to its existing plans. As for cloud gaming (a category Luna also falls into), there&#39;s NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce Now and Google Stadia, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-cloud-gaming-platform-smart-tv-155226529.html"><ins>Samsung has cloud gaming ambitions</ins></a>.</p><p>PlayStation Now was one of the earliest major game subscription services when it debuted in 2015, but it had a fairly tepid response. Players were only able to access PS Now games via the cloud until 2018, when they were able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-20-playstation-now-ps4-ps2-game-downloads.html"><ins>download some PS4 and PS2 titles</ins></a> to their console.</p><p>One of the biggest complaints we had about the service when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-playstation-now-re-review.html"><ins>we reviewed it again in 2019</ins></a> was the lack of notable games. Since then, Sony has brought some big games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-playstation-now-fallout-76-final-fantasy-163716243.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us Part II</ins></em><ins> to PS Now</ins></a> for a limited time.</p><p>By the end of Sony&#39;s 2020 financial year, there were <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2021/GNS_E.pdf"><ins>only 3.2 million PS Now subscribers</ins></a>. Microsoft <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-game-pass-subscriber-growth-missed-microsofts-annual-target/"><ins>announced</ins></a> in January that it had 18 million Game Pass members. For that reason and many others, it&#39;s a smart idea for Sony to go back to the drawing board and create a more robust subscription service.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like Microsoft, Sony has started looking beyond PlayStation consoles to bring its games to new audiences. Over the last year or so, it released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-000029472.html"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/days-gone-pc-release-date-steam-epic-games-store-trailer-140746800.html"><em>Days Gone</em></a> on PC. A bundle of <em>Uncharted 4 </em>and <em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-4-and-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-coming-to-ps-5-and-pc-211007741.html">coming to PC in early 2022</a>, as is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-god-of-war-pc-january-14-153911186.html">the 2018 reboot of <em>God of War</em></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-xbox-game-pass-subscription-sparatcus-175650996.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06679f6d-8491-4265-8efe-92f5568e7eaa</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:56:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638556254</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T04:45:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle is on sale for $55 with three months of Kindle Unlimited]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed Amazon&#39;s standard e-reader when it was on sale for $50 on Black Friday, you have another shot to grab it for less.

It may be a bit more expensive than it was one week ago, but the added bonus of Kindle Unlimited sweetens the deal a bit ‚Äî and you&#39;re still getting the device for $35 less than usual.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EgIzmN" id="988fe6a23bd6473baba378be7f54984e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $55</a><p>Amazon updated the Kindle in 2019 and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">score of 91</a> when we reviewed the e-reader. The base model gave the previous-generation Paperwhite a run for its money thanks to its new front-lit display with better contrast and its smaller, sleeker design. It also comes with 8GB of storage, which is plenty of space to hold thousands of titles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The differences between the standard Kindle and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:new Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/31kd8tq">new Kindle Paperwhite</a> will be more apparent, and they should be considering the latter costs $140. The new Paperwhite&#39;s 300ppi screen is slightly larger and 10 percent brighter, and page-turning is said to be about 20 percent faster. The higher-end model also has Audible support, so you can listen to audiobooks when you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones connected, and it&#39;s water-resistant as well.</p><p>If you can live without those extra perks, it&#39;s hard to beat the standard Kindle when it&#39;s on sale like this. It would make a good stocking stuffer for the book-lover in your life, or a convenient gadget if you plan on trying to read more in the new year. And with Kindle Unlimited for a couple of months, you&#39;ll get access to thousands of titles to read at your leisure at no extra cost. Just remember that the subscription will renew at the standard $10-per-month rate after the first three months are up.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-is-on-sale-for-55-with-three-months-of-kindle-unlimited-173203718.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f83312-ac9a-4863-a494-cffed7db6f17</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:32:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638552725</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:32:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird expands its electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals to San Diego]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bird/">Bird</a> is bringing its electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters to more cities.

Like anybody can edit.
