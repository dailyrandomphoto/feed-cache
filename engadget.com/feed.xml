It&#39;s arguably the best and most practical version of a Samsung foldable yet, and now it&#39;s been discounted by $150 on Amazon as part of the deals-focused event dubbed Samsung Week. That brings the final price down to $850, which is a record low.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3vuUUjO" id="0c6b626e6f0543c39061222045125e5b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Z Flip 3 at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YX01NT" id="a36805dddf5f45a0b93ccfe892627043" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Samsung Week deals</a><p>We gave the Z Flip 3 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">score of 82</a> in part because Samsung fixed a few things about its predecessor with this smartphone. First off, it seems to be more durable than the last — it doesn&#39;t scratch as easily and now is IPX8 water resistant. The main 6.7-inch AMOLED display runs at a 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and supports 120Hz refresh rates. Yes, you will notice its crease, but it doesn&#39;t hinder readability — you&#39;ll notice is more so because you&#39;re probably not used to a screen that folds in this way. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch external screen to get small bits of information like the weather and calendar events, as well as quickly access features like Samsung Pay and media controls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Flex Mode kicks in when you half-fold the device, and it&#39;ll split the screen in half when in certain apps. When watching a YouTube video, for example, the video player will be on the top half of the screen while the video&#39;s details and comments section will be on the bottom. It&#39;s a clever way to ensure that the entirety of the main screen is useful even when the device is partially folded, although we&#39;d like to see a greater variety of apps support Flex Mode sooner rather than later.</p><p>The Z Flip 3 runs on a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, and it has a dual camera setup on the back along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera. The two 12MP rear cameras took colorful, detailed shots, and even nighttime photos looks very similar to those taken by competing phones from Apple and Google.</p><p>The biggest sacrifices you&#39;ll have to make with the Z Flip 3 are in durability and battery life. The former is a bit of a toss up — we only used the Z Flip 3 for a short period of time when we reviewed it, so it&#39;s unclear how well its foldable screen will hold up after months and years of use. As for battery life, it will depend on how much you use the external display. The Z Flip 3 lasted more than a day in our testing, but that figure dropped to around 11.5 hours when the external display was in always-on mode. If those sound like acceptable trade-offs to you, Amazon&#39;s sale on the Z Flip 3 is the best way we&#39;ve seen so far to get the foldable at a more affordable price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-drops-to-850-at-amazon-samsung-week-deals-143712131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">15cb0fb7-c072-4cc2-b4bd-550dea88a652</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 14:37:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634567835</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T14:37:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c99b2be0-00f5-11ec-b6ff-6e47595e29c3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c99b2be0-00f5-11ec-b6ff-6e47595e29c3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 half folded and set up on a table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon accused of lying about its business practices to Congress]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Members of Congress have accused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> executives of misleading or lying to an antitrust committee about its business practices, following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-india-products-copy-search-results-manipulation-174030250.html">recent reports</a> that the company uses third-party seller data to copy products and promotes those versions in search results.

David Cicilline, Ken Buck, Pramila Jayapal, Jerrold Nadler and Matt Gaetz asked Amazon to provide &quot;exculpatory evidence” to back up testimony from executives )(including former CEO Jeff Bezos) to the subcommittee in 2019 and 2020, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/members-of-congressional-committee-question-if-amazon-executives-misled-congress-11634551201"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>.</em> Bezos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-hearing-third-party-sellers-201126053.html">told the committee last year</a> that the company doesn&#39;t allow employees to use data from individual sellers to bolster its own product lines, though &quot;couldn&#39;t guarantee&quot; that the company hasn&#39;t misused such data.

The representatives said the reporting directly contradicts sworn testimony from Bezos, from whom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-final-date-174948346.html">Jassy took over in July,</a> and other executives.</p><p>“We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. &quot;At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon&#39;s representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law.&quot;</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has been looking into this issue <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-13-us-asks-apple-google-facebook-and-amazon-for-docs-in-antitrust.html">since 2019</a> as part of a broader investigation of competition in digital markets. The representatives gave Jassy until November 1st to respond to the letter. &quot;We’re giving Amazon one last chance to come clean about how they abuse other seller’s data and unfairly advantage their own products,&quot; subcommittee chair Cicilline <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcicilline/status/1450097641472368648">wrote on Twitter</a>. &quot;We cannot continue to allow Big Tech to destroy small businesses.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Like other retailers, we look at sales and store data to provide our customers with the best possible experience,&quot; Amazon told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. &quot;However, we strictly prohibit our employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch. While we don’t believe these claims are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation.&quot;</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question. As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer’s policy that we’re aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action. In addition, we design our search experience to feature the items customers will want to purchase, regardless of whether they are offered by Amazon or one of our selling partners.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-seller-data-house-judiciary-committee-142110829.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a95aab2-2dc7-4e17-9f2a-f957357306a1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634567042</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T14:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/4c92d490-bd70-11eb-91ff-aa70026e20e7" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/4c92d490-bd70-11eb-91ff-aa70026e20e7" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Ryder via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, WA - MAY 20: A sign is seen outside of an Amazon Go store at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters on May 20, 2021 in Seattle, Washington.

First and foremost, you&#39;re getting all of the benefits of OLED, which means better colors, great contrast and deep blacks. It plays 4K HDR content, supports Dolby Vision and it includes the company&#39;s Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker built-in, giving you more immersive sound quality. The set runs on Android TV, which means you can call upon the Google Assistant to play content and otherwise control the system — but it also supports Alexa voice commands too, if you prefer to use that. On top of all that, it has a dedicated Game Mode for smoother gaming sessions and it supports AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those not set on OLED for their next TV should consider the 2020 Sony X950H sets on sale — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:55-inch model" href="https://amzn.to/3jcLXXq">55-inch model</a> is down to $950 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:65-inch set" href="https://amzn.to/3C77gRL">65-inch set</a> is on sale for $1,200. While the picture quality won&#39;t be the same as the OLED set, these TVs do have local dimming LED backlighting as well as many of the advanced features present in the A9G. You&#39;ll get the Android TV operating system, Google Assistant and Alexa support, Game Mode, plus AirPlay 2 and HomeKit compatibility.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-oled-led-smart-tvs-daily-deal-amazon-132918061.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">460a53d0-088c-418a-90ef-83a34d48fee1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 13:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634563761</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T13:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8360ebd0-d06a-11eb-9faf-a3228bef42d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8360ebd0-d06a-11eb-9faf-a3228bef42d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[65-inch Sony XBR-65A9G Master Series Bravia 4K OLED TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[65-inch Sony XBR-65A9G Master Series Bravia 4K OLED TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's Streambar returns to record low of $100 ahead of the holidays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As November inches closer, we&#39;re starting to see even more early Black Friday deals on gadgets crop up across the web.

Now there&#39;s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-annoucement-130016539.html">lower-tier RX 6600</a> and the story is pretty much the same — except, you know, worse. I suppose the existence of an &quot;XT&quot; card implies a more mainstream version eventually. But after testing out the RX 6600 for the past week, I&#39;m still wondering who this card is for.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6a86ccaa-3ad0-4d77-9e47-506bdd685cc1"/><p>Of course, that&#39;s a tough question to answer when the GPU market is so volatile and card prices vary wildly. AMD says the RX 6600&#39;s suggested retail price is $329, compared to $379 for the 6600XT. But given the global chip shortage and resellers hungry for more GPUs, those prices are purely conceptual. In the real world, the 6600XT now sells for upwards of $600 (and in some cases close to $800!). The 6600 is also competing against the RTX 3060, which also has an MSRP of $329, but is now selling between <a href="https://www.newegg.com/gigabyte-geforce-rtx-3060-gv-n3060vision-oc-12gd/p/N82E16814932401">$800 and $1,020</a>. So much for budget GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AMD, a company with a reputation for creating budget-friendly cards that packed a decent punch, probably wanted to stay true to its roots. But unless it can guarantee a price close to MSRP, the RX 6600 just seems out of place in today&#39;s gaming landscape. As you&#39;ll see in our testing, it&#39;s a capable 1080p gaming card. But its ray tracing performance is terrible, and it can&#39;t take advantage of NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology, which uses AI to boost performance.</p><p>I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t really expect much from the RX 6600 from the start. Under the hood, its RDNA 2 architecture is powered by 28 compute units and 1,792 stream processors, a noticeable step down from the 6600XT&#39;s 32 CUs and 2,048 stream processors. There&#39;s also a serious speed difference: the cheaper card has 2,044 MHz game clock and 2,491 MHz boost, compared to 2,359 MHz while gaming on the 6600 XT and a 2,589 MHz boost. Both cards have 8GB of GDDR6 RAM, but the 6600&#39;s memory bandwidth is 34 GB/s slower at 224 GB/s.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>3DMark TimeSpy</p></td><td><p>Destiny 2</p></td><td><p>Hitman 3</p></td><td><p>Port Royal (ray tracing)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 6600</p></td><td><p>8,521</p></td><td><p>1080p: 110-120 | 1440p: 75-85</p></td><td><p>1080p: 138 | 1440p: 94 </p></td><td><p>3,846/17fps</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</p></td><td><p>9,872</p></td><td><p>1080p: 130-150 | 1440p: 85-105</p></td><td><p>1080p: 146 | 1440p: 110 </p></td><td><p>4,5824/32.22fps</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</p></td><td><p>11,198</p></td><td><p>1440p: 75-100fps</p><p>4K: 50-75fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>5,920/27.4fps</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NVIDIA RTX 3060 Ti</p></td><td><p>11,308</p></td><td><p>1440p: 85-110fps</p><p>4K: 45-60fps</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>6,989/32.36fps</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Given those specs, I predicted the RX 6600 would be a decent 1080p card and not much else. And for the most part, that&#39;s what my testing proved: It reached a solid 120FPS in <em>Destiny 2</em> while playing in 1080p with maxed out graphics. Once I pushed the game to 1,440p, though, it fell to 80fps. That pattern held true for pretty much everything I tested. <em>Hitman 3&#39;s </em>benchmark reached a respectable 138fps in 1080p with graphics settings cranked to the maximum, but only 94fps in 1,440p.</p><p>If you&#39;ve got an AMD Ryzen 5000 CPU (or some 3000 models), the RX 6600 will be a slight upgrade thanks to Smart Access Memory. That&#39;s a feature that basically lets your CPU directly address all of your video card&#39;s RAM, and it&#39;s something you can&#39;t use at all if you&#39;ve got an Intel CPU. I had SAM enabled on my testing rig, which was powered by a Ryzen 7 5800X and 32GB of RAM, in case you were wondering.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8efa040-2d75-11ec-95bf-50b9487f96b4" alt="AMD Radeon RX 6600 rear case" data-uuid="620679ca-8589-34be-b016-f63b9f1aa6c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Both the Radeon RX 6600 and 6600 XT had a hard time competing against their NVIDIA counterparts in our benchmarks. The RTX 3060 Ti reached 11,308 in 3DMark Time Spy, whereas the 6600 XT hit 9,872 and the 6600 trailed behind with a score of 8,521. I didn&#39;t have an RTX 3060 on-hand to test, but <a href="https://www.3dmark.com/search?_ga=2.119508300.436475288.1634243470-148067295.1634243470#advanced?test=spy%20P&amp;cpuId=2759&amp;gpuId=1375&amp;gpuCount=0&amp;deviceType=ALL&amp;memoryChannels=0&amp;country=&amp;scoreType=overallScore&amp;hofMode=false&amp;showInvalidResults=false&amp;freeParams=&amp;minGpuCoreClock=&amp;maxGpuCoreClock=&amp;minGpuMemClock=&amp;maxGpuMemClock=&amp;minCpuClock=&amp;maxCpuClock=">3DMark&#39;s verified benchmarks with similar systems</a> show scores of around 10,000.</p><p>Ray tracing was also a lost cause with the 6,600 — just flipping on ray traced reflections in <em>Control</em> slowed the game to a meager 35fps. Without ray tracing, it was at least playable in 1080p, hitting between 60 and 70fps. Now <em>Control</em> is a notoriously tough game on GPUs, but at least NVIDIA cards let me get decent framerates with ray tracing thanks to DLSS, which uses AI processing to upscale the game from a lower resolution. AMD&#39;s alternative technology, FidelityFX Super Resolution, isn&#39;t supported in <em>Control</em> yet. That solution is also cross-compatible with NVIDIA cards, so you won&#39;t need a Radeon GPU to take advantage of it — which again makes me wonder, why would you get the RX 6600 instead of the 3060?</p><p>I could see it being a worthwhile card for a very specific gamer: Someone who has a small case and doesn&#39;t want to upgrade beyond a 450 watt power supply. The RX 6600 has a total board power demand of 132 watts, compared to 170 watts on the RTX 3060. That&#39;s a major reason why it runs so cool, reaching only around 70 celsius under load (the 3060 typically runs between 70 and 75 celsius when stressed). Still, I can&#39;t imagine that someone who wants to shell out $329 for a GPU (and realistically <em>much</em> more), would limit themselves based on a weak power supply.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8f76870-2d75-11ec-8dff-8a6a272e8489" alt="AMD Radeon RX 6600 on a table" data-uuid="9a03dde4-bf76-3a6f-a606-ca437b870ffb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>A good PC upgrade is one that&#39;ll last you for years, and, unfortunately, I can&#39;t imagine that&#39;ll be true of the RX 6600. Solid 1080p performance is a nice feature to have today, but 1,440p monitors are getting cheaper and games are becoming more demanding. Who knows if the 6600 will be able to handle a flagship title in a few years even at 1080p. And if you end up upgrading to a 1,440p, ultrawide, or 4K screen over the next few years, you&#39;ll have to upgrade immediately.</p><p>The Radeon RX 6600 could be a decent contender if the GPU market stabilizes and AMD pushes the price below $300. But for now, it’s a misfire that only makes sense if you can’t get your hands on an RTX 3060.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-gpu-120013965.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24858178-664d-4401-8307-bfff2daadb45</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634321669</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T18:14:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8f76870-2d75-11ec-8dff-8a6a272e8489" width="2000" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8f76870-2d75-11ec-8dff-8a6a272e8489" width="2000" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD Radeon RX 6600 on a table]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD Radeon RX 6600]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Apple's Mac and Google's Pixel events, previewed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s second fall product event kicks off later today at 1 PM ET.

The company said it is &quot;no longer the new kid in town&quot; when it comes to EVs, and aims to develop a business worth up to $NT 1 trillion, or around $36 billion per year.</p><p>Foxconn developed the EV prototypes under the Foxtron brand in collaboration with Taiwan&#39;s Yulon Motor. The latter has its own brand (Luxgen) and manufactures Nissan and Mitsubishi vehicles for the local market. The prototypes include a luxury sedan, SUV and transit bus, labeled the Model E, Model C and Model T, respectively.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0d74b3291db5454793b27fc96277dee3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UGukbUZgoKI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The vehicles are based on Foxconn&#39;s open software and hardware platform, MIH Consortium. They&#39;re essentially designed as kits, serving as reference designs that EV brands can mass produce to their own specifications.&nbsp;</p><p>The Model T bus could hit roads as early as next year (hopefully under a different name), with a projected range of 400 km and top speed of 120 km/h (75 MPH). It also includes technology like pedestrian warnings, advanced temperature management and high crashworthiness, according to <a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4318102"><em>Taiwan News</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Foxtron&#39;s Model C is an electric SUV that will be available in Taiwan by 2023 with high efficiency and zippy 3.8 second 0-to-62 MPH speeds. It&#39;s expected to cost below $NT 1 million ($35,700), said Foxconn chairperson Young Liu. The Model E, a luxury performance sedan designed in partnership with Pininfarina, will enter the market at a later, unspecified date. It will offer 750 horsepower and deliver a 0-62 MPH time of 2.8 seconds, along with a 750 km range. Yulon will be among the first EV makers to use the designs, said chairperson Lilian Chen.&nbsp;</p><p>Foxtron said it aims to capitalize on a trend of producing EVs close to the markets where they&#39;re sold in order to keep costs down. The company plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/foxconn-electric-vehicle-factories-us-thailand-141124688.html">build EV factories</a> in the US, and recently <a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/green-cars/a37851210/lordstown-selling-plant-to-foxconn/">announced</a> that it would acquire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">troubled</a> Lordstown&#39;s Ohio manufacturing plant. It aims to manufacture Lordstown&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-endurance-race-truck-214135593.html">Endurance pickup truck</a> at the plant, and build Fisker EVs in the complex by late 2023.

The technology should help minimize touch during the pandemic, but is mainly meant to speed up transaction times. That could be important when you may have roughly 25 minutes to serve an entire school of hungry kids.</p><p>Both the schools and system installer CRB Cunningham argued the systems would address privacy and security concerns. CRB Cunningham noted its hardware wasn&#39;t using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-06-uk-police-arrest-automatic-facial-recognition.html">live facial recognition</a> (actively scanning crowds), and was checking against encrypted faceprint templates. Schools were already using fingerprint readers, too, so this was more of a shift in biometric technology than a brand new layer of security. There were also concerns about fraud using conventional PINs — facial recognition is theoretically safer. North Ayrshire&#39;s council added that 97 percent of children or parents had offered consent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That won&#39;t satisfy some critics, though. Big Brother Watch and England&#39;s Biometrics Commissioner both maintained that facial recognition was arbitrary. There was a concern that school rollouts might normalize face scanning and numb students to privacy concerns. If you grow up with this technology, you might not object when it crops up at airports or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-17-download-festival-face-scanning.html">music festivals</a>.</p><p>You might not see this spread to the US and other countries given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-temporary-ban-facial-recogniton-schools-144320708.html">mounting opposition</a>. However, it&#39;s safe to say many will be watching the UK school rollout to gauge both the viability of facial recognition and its real-world pitfalls.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-school-facial-recognition-cafeteria-canteen-200457972.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce59361b-0c66-4836-9585-46720f0be940</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 20:04:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634560290</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T12:31:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Schools]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07e02e80-2f7e-11ec-be9d-09411fc21014" width="5333" height="3555" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07e02e80-2f7e-11ec-be9d-09411fc21014" width="5333" height="3555" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[monkeybusinessimages via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[High School Students Wearing Uniform Being Served Food In Canteen]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[High School Students Wearing Uniform Being Served Food In Canteen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla starts delivering refreshed Model X to customers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla delivered its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-redesign-interior-221606865.html">redesigned Tesla Model S interior</a> in early 2021, and now Model X buyers are finally getting their turn. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/16/refreshed-tesla-model-x/"><em>Electrek</em></a> and TMC forum member <a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/refreshed-2021-model-x-lr-plaid-waiting-room.219586/page-227#post-6021857">Sunnyvaletree</a> report that Tesla has <a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla/status/1449731354103529476">started delivering</a> the revised Model X to customers, holding at least one event to mark the occasion.

Integrity VP Guy Rosen has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/">posted</a> a defense of the social network&#39;s anti-hate measures where he argued the declining visibility of hate speech mattered more than the mere existence of that content. The &quot;prevalence&quot; (aka visibility) of hate on Facebook has dropped nearly 50 percent in the past three quarters to 0.05 percent of content viewed, Rosen said, or about five views out of every 10,000.</p><p>The executive contended it was &quot;wrong&quot; to focus on content removals as the only metric. There were other ways to counter hate, Rosen said, and Facebook had to be &quot;confident&quot; before it removed any material. That meant erring on the side of caution to avoid mistakenly removing content, and limiting the reach of people, groups and pages that will probably violate policies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There is a degree of truth here. Facebook has occasionally run into trouble for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-myanmar-coup-restore-post-china-164304497.html">mistakenly flagging content</a> as hate speech, and an aggressive removal system might lead to further accidents. Likewise, hate will only have limited impact if few people ever see a given post.</p><p>However, there&#39;s little doubt Facebook is engaged in some spin. Haugen in her testimony asserted that Facebook can only catch a &quot;very tiny minority&quot; of offending material — that&#39;s still an issue if true, even if only a small fraction of users ever see the material. Rosen&#39;s response also doesn&#39;t touch on Haugen&#39;s allegations that Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">resisted implementing safer algorithms</a> and other efforts to minimize hateful and divisive interactions. Facebook may be making significant strides in limiting hate, but that&#39;s not Haugen&#39;s point — it&#39;s that the social media firm isn&#39;t doing enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6de46c72-17f4-428b-8aad-7bff10329dd1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 17:01:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634511207</ingested><modified>2021-10-17T22:53:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/25d7ebc0-2f66-11ec-96fc-9dbc12a7aa03" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/25d7ebc0-2f66-11ec-96fc-9dbc12a7aa03" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 06: In this photo illustration, the logo of social media application Facebook is seen through a magnifying glass on October 06, 2021 in Paris, France.

This applies across multiple colors, charging case options and Active variants.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FSBs5h" id="8dde6d6f1ce544308848496b53e2f802" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Jabra Elite 75t Earbuds">Buy Elite 75t on Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3APkOjc" id="907ee4b30aa544eda43a586e038d36ec" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Jabra Elite 85t Earbuds">Buy Elite 85t on Amazon - $180</a><p>The Elite 75t and 85t share a common recipe for success: they&#39;re comfortable, offer solid (though not always stellar) sound quality and last a long while on battery. These may be your picks for lengthy studying sessions and arduous hikes. The 75t is a relatively no-frills design, while the 85t adds perks like active noise cancellation and optional wireless charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They have their catches. The Elite 75t is relatively plain at a time when many $100 earbuds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">offer ANC</a>, and their on-bud controls take practice. The Elite 85t is feature-packed, but it sounds merely average for the money. Don&#39;t overlook the importance of comfort, though — and Jabra&#39;s platform independence might be a plus if you aren&#39;t tied to any one device ecosystem.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-75t-85t-sale-amazon-155042486.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78fe52ea-fb3f-466b-b86f-04a5eb6c69ec</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 15:50:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634485842</ingested><modified>2021-10-17T15:50:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2b9f590-2f5b-11ec-bfeb-90b074686c1a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2b9f590-2f5b-11ec-bfeb-90b074686c1a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85t wireless earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85t wireless earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's new MacBook Pro chips may be called the M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Leaks are still pouring in just a day before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">Apple&#39;s &quot;Unleashed&quot; event</a> kicks off. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/m1-pro-and-m1-max-chip-names-app-log/">According</a> to <em>MacRumors</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-10-17/when-will-new-apple-aapl-macbook-pro-launch-as-soon-as-monday-kuvjbbne">Mark Gurman</a> understands the chips for the widely expected 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models have surfaced in developer app logs under the names &quot;M1 Pro&quot; and &quot;M1 Max.&quot; It&#39;s not certain Apple will use these names for its high-end silicon, but they suggest Apple won&#39;t go with M1X or otherwise echo the naming scheme used for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-apple-ipad-pro-12-9-review-2020-lidar-trackpad.html">souped-up A-series chips</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier rumors have hinted at two processors destined for the new MacBook Pros. Both would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">include 10 cores</a> (eight high-performance, two high-efficiency). An &#39;entry&#39; version would include a 16-core GPU, while the higher-end model would pack a 32-core GPU. This roughly lines up with the M1 Pro and M1 Max naming schemes. Other rumors have pointed to a direct sequel to the base M1, the M2, arriving sometime in early 2022 alongside a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gurman also reiterated the changes he and others expect from the MacBook Pro redesign. Both laptops would include mini-LED displays with higher resolutions. They may bring back welcome connectors like a MagSafe power port, HDMI and an SD card slot. You might also see support for up to 64GB of RAM and the death of the Touch Bar.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be shocking if Apple brought its Pro and Max naming schemes to computer CPUs. If Apple is going to replace all Intel chips with in-house processors, as planned, those clearer names might be necessary to help buyers understand performance differences between models. If Apple does use the M1 Pro and M1 Max names, that will speak volumes about its likely chip name strategy going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-m1-pro-m1-max-leak-145253589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04cb5fc6-f453-4aec-ba15-757c0dff80e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 14:52:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634507722</ingested><modified>2021-10-17T21:55:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c3f773a0-b7e5-11eb-bfff-8865a6ff63da" width="1600" height="1033" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c3f773a0-b7e5-11eb-bfff-8865a6ff63da" width="1600" height="1033" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
