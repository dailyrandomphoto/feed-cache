The company just sent out invites to Galaxy Unpacked for August 11th at 10am ET, and the event will be held online only.&nbsp;</p><p>In years past, Samsung&#39;s hosted August launches for its Note series of high-powered phones. This time, though, multiple reports have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-note-2021-report-185555313.html">indicated that there won&#39;t be a new Note</a>. That&#39;s become a more likely possibility now, after the company brought Pen support to its Galaxy S21 flagships this year.

Starting today, you can watch the pilot episodes of select series, including <em>Game of Throne</em>s, <em>Lovecraft Country</em> and <em>Gossip Girl</em>, <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-brings-free-episodes-snapchat-new-app-co-viewing-experience">on Snapchat</a> and do so while chatting with up to 63 other people.</p><p>The ability to watch HBO Max content through Snapchat comes courtesy of the Minis functionality <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-mini-apps-174530579.html">Snap introduced last June</a>. The tool allows third-party developers to offer pared-down versions of their apps within Snapchat. So far, some of the more popular developers to offer Minis include Headspace, but HBO Max is the first major streamer to use the feature to let people view its content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can start the HBO Max Mini by tapping on the rocket icon in chat or using the search feature to find it. Before you can see a list of available episodes, the app will ask you to verify your age. You don&#39;t need an HBO Max subscription to watch any of the pilots, but the Mini will prompt users over the age of 18 to sign up for the service. Once a session is underway, up to 63 other people can join one, and you can chat with everyone else watching the episode and share Bitmoji reactions.</p><p>HBO Max isn&#39;t the first streaming service to use another platform to attract users. Before its all too predictable death, Quibi let people watch pilots of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-originals-available-youtube-173238029.html">originals on YouTube</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-hbo-max-mini-223803217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d9c43a9-a7a3-49ee-ac40-f272baf9a7d8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 22:38:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626819500</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T22:18:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2e764d40-e9a6-11eb-9b8f-bc9ad81e6fca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2e764d40-e9a6-11eb-9b8f-bc9ad81e6fca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WarnerMedia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO Max Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO Max Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube’s Super Thanks tipping feature rolls out to more beta users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, YouTube streamers have used third-party plugins to allow their fans to donate to them. Starting this week, however, YouTube is taking a step toward making that functionality something that’s built into the platform. While it’s still in beta, the company says its new “Super Thanks” feature is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-newest-member-supers-family-super-thanks/">rolling out to “thousands” of additional creators in 68 countries</a>. By the end of the year, it plans to make it available to everyone in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>When you decide to give your favorite creator a Super Thanks, you’ll have four options before you. The amounts will vary by market, but in the US you can donate $2, $5, $10 or $50 at one time. Once you complete the payment process, you’ll see an animated GIF of balloons float across your screen, and YouTube will highlight your comment, as well as the amount of money you sent. As with the other monetization tools YouTube offers to streamers, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-12-youtube-super-chat-comments-are-a-new-way-to-support-livestrea.html"><ins>Super Chat</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-youtube-animated-stickers-streamers-twitch-mixer.html"><ins>Super Stickers</ins></a>, the company will take a 30 percent cut of all donations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adding more ways for creators to earn money is important for YouTube, even if it’s one the company is late to offer. Long gone are the days where it&#39;s the only video platform of note. The company faces competition from Twitch, TikTok and others, particularly as those platforms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html"><ins>look for ways</ins></a> to keep their most prolific creators invested in making content only for their respective apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-super-thanks-213222316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">489087fd-62b9-4bc4-9cc3-001ec97c7f6b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 21:32:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626813815</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T20:43:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c15954d0-e998-11eb-a7eb-67aebffb3cc2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c15954d0-e998-11eb-a7eb-67aebffb3cc2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube Super Thanks]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube Super Thanks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix says its gaming push will begin with mobile]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A report last week hinted at some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html">Netflix&#39;s gaming ambitions</a>. In <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">its Q2 2021 earnings report</a>, the company confirmed some things. First, Netflix says it &quot;will be primarily focused&quot; on mobile at first, looking to expand on its interactivity projects like <em>Black Mirror Bandersnatch </em>and its Stranger Things games. The upcoming titles will be available at no additional cost as part of your subscription and the company was clear it will keep up the pace on movies and television.</p><p>&quot;We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,&quot; the company said in a letter to its shareholders.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>2020 was a big year for Netflix. With everyone stuck at home and movie theaters closed, the streaming service attracted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">16 million new customers in three months</a>. As expected, in 2021 that pace has dramatically slowed and the new customer numbers continue to be a struggle. In its earnings report, the company says it added 1.5 million subscribers in Q2, which was actually a bit better than its forecast mark of one million. However, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html">lower than Q1 2021</a>, which saw the company tack on 3.98 new customers globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says it forecasts new customer additions to hit 3.5 million in Q3 2021, up from 2.2 million during the same three-month a year ago. If it does so, the company explains that would bring the total new subscriber tally to 54 million over the last two years. The pace may have slowed for Netflix, but overall it&#39;s doing just fine. Revenue was still up 19 percent year-over-year at $7.3 billion for the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Netflix&#39;s own numbers, <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was a popular series this quarter, streaming to over 55 million &quot;member households&quot; in less than a month. The show has already been renewed for a second season based on those numbers. <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>a series based on a DC comic, was streamed by 60 million households the first month it was available. Unscripted series like <em>Too Hot to Handle </em>and <em>The Circle </em>were popular selections as well, as was true crime docuseries <em>The Sons of Sam. </em>In terms of movies, Zac Snyder&#39;s <em>Army of the Dead </em>hit 75 million households in the first month. Netflix also explained that <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines </em>is now its biggest animated film to date, streaming to 53 million households.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says COVID-related production delays led to a &quot;lighter&quot; first half of 2021 in terms of content, but the pace will pick up throughout the rest of the year. The company&#39;s Q3 lineup includes new seasons of <em>La Casa de Papel</em> (<em>Money Heist</em>), <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Virgin River</em> and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> in addition to live action films like <em>Sweet Girl</em> (Jason Momoa), <em>Kissing Booth 3 </em>and <em>Kate</em> (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Plus, there&#39;s the animated film <em>Vivo</em>, which will feature new music from Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q2-2021-earnings-204531144.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8db2f676-b5cb-4171-aaa0-9c979f32642a</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 20:45:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626813934</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T20:45:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/081a1ca0-e995-11eb-b57f-ad1c34547a82" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/081a1ca0-e995-11eb-b57f-ad1c34547a82" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos swung by space and has some thoughts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos, a 57-year-old dad from New Mexico, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">flew to the edge of space</a> and back again today. He wasn&#39;t the only person aboard the rocket, which was the first-ever crewed flight from private space company Blue Origin, but he&#39;s the one that camera crews flocked to once the 10-minute trip was done. Maybe they were drawn in by his smile. Maybe they thought he was the winner of a sub-orbital Lex Luthor lookalike contest. Maybe his bulbous, pale cowboy hat caught their eye.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality of course, it was because Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin and Amazon, and considered to be the richest person in the world. This wealth not only gives him the opportunity to build, run and then ride his own rocket ships, but it also makes people really interested in what he has to say, regardless of his relationship to the matter at hand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Bezos stepped back onto Earth after spinning around in zero-gravity for a few minutes, the cameras descended and his cowboy hat answered a handful of questions about the experience. The world&#39;s richest man shared his thoughts about space, pollution and wage depression, likely just before taking an SUV caravan to his private jet and heading to one of his global luxury estates.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three of the most centibillionaire things Bezos said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/jeff-bezos-says-spaceflight-reinforced-commitment-solving-climate-chan-rcna1467">after his Blue Origin flight</a> today:</p><p><strong>“We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry, and move it into space. And keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is.”</strong> In this same interview, Bezos discussed his plans to expand Blue Origin&#39;s space tourism business over the coming decades, a venture that has the potential to pump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions">massive amounts of carbon and other chemicals</a> into the atmosphere. Unlike ground-based emitters like cars or coal-powered plants, rocket emissions are expelled directly into the upper atmosphere, where they linger for years. Additionally, Amazon has threatened <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-amazon-employees-protest-climate-communications-policies.html">to fire employees</a> for speaking up about the company&#39;s support of the oil and gas industries.</p><p><strong>&quot;We need unifiers, not vilifiers. When you look out at the planet, there are no borders. There&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s one planet and we share it and it&#39;s fragile.&quot;</strong> As the CEO of Amazon, for years Bezos fought against company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">efforts to unionize</a>, even amid credible reports of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-200-million-prime-subscribers-165713430.html">inhumane, exploitative conditions</a> for Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers.&nbsp;</p><div id="8fdead6a8e424ddaa7586aadb74bb974"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffBezos</a> speaking truth after successful <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueOrigin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlueOrigin</a> flight: <br><br>“I also want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all of this.” <a href="https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs">https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs</a><a href="https://t.co/3CueAOX9M8">pic.twitter.com/3CueAOX9M8</a></p>— Dan Linden (@DanLinden) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanLinden/status/1417513266050445312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Bezos, who amassed more than $70 billion in personal wealth last year and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">regularly pays $0 in federal income taxes</a>, then thanked those same Amazon employees for paying for his trip to space.

A major expansion is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-endwalker-november-23rd-214301453.html"><ins>scheduled to arrive in November</ins></a>, and players may be returning or picking the game up ahead of <em>Endwalker</em>&#39;s arrival.</p><p>However, the game&#39;s servers are struggling to handle the influx of players. Producer and director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c2d7b35d55577879086b64cfde0acb6c23ccd07f"><ins>wrote that</ins></a> many players in North America and Europe have had trouble logging in or creating characters recently because of &quot;server congestion.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some North American servers were at maximum capacity for up to seven hours at some points last weekend, and the average queue times were around 10-20 minutes. On the European servers, players had to wait for up to 40 minutes.</p><p>Square Enix has revealed some measures to tackle <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online</em>&#39;s server issues. It has accelerated plans to boot out players who stay idle for too long. That feature is typically enabled when a new expansion arrives to help the systems cope with a surge in player numbers, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22585359/final-fantasy-14-streamer-popularity-afk-timer-developer-statement"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, but Square Enix is bringing it back early. Yoshida also asked players to log out and free up spots if they&#39;re inactive.</p><p>The publisher says the game&#39;s North American data centers were recently upgraded. As of this week, the game supports up to 18,000 simultaneous logins in that region — up to 750 players per world server. The European data centers are in line for a similar upgrade soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yoshida noted the global semiconductor shortage has slowed delivery of servers to some data centers. Travel restrictions related to COVID-19 have prevented the server infrastructure team from visiting data centers too.</p><p>It&#39;s fascinating to see a game that&#39;s been around for eight years have such a massive, sudden increase in popularity, four months out from the next expansion. Still, it once again highlights the impact that streamers have on gaming culture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-final-fantasy-xiv-servers-plan-193317600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7111623-d43e-40ff-b1b6-fa5cb106a36e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 19:33:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626809860</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T19:37:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropbox makes automatic camera uploads available to all free users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox is introducing a variety of <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-features-to-keep-you-organized-at-work-and-home"><ins>new features across its product stack</ins></a>.

Notably, these features come after Google recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-free-unlimited-storage-end-date-133058166.html"><ins>stopped offering unlimited free uploads to its Photos service</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7c85f10-e986-11eb-9cff-c2828555fcec" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Dropbox interface" data-uuid="528f6895-a43f-39cf-b5f4-a123fe0c1def"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dropbox</div></figure><p>In its web client, meanwhile, Dropbox is introducing several interface tweaks. The most significant of those changes is the addition of a new tool that allows you to convert files to different formats without leaving the client, with JPEGs to PNGs as one example. Elsewhere, Dropbox says a redesigned details pane makes it easier to see important information about your files. The company claims it has also made it faster to jump between different folders with a new side navigation bar.</p><p>As part of today’s update, Dropbox is also introducing a handful of new features to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-passwords-vault-130030637.html"><ins>password manager</ins></a>. Available to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-passwords-free-for-all-users-130012723.html"><ins>free users as of earlier this year</ins></a>, the tool can now store debit and credit card information. Dropbox has also added support for password sharing. Oh, and you can now download a free browser extension, making it easier to input and save passwords when you’re browsing the web on your computer. On their own, the changes Dropbox detailed today are small, but when you add them up, they make for a more compelling service.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-automatic-camera-uploads-free-users-183521936.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">928d03b5-67b2-408b-a3c3-f7d2f32c7524</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 18:35:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626805645</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T18:27:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b597dc50-e986-11eb-9b76-a3fb69f6b928" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b597dc50-e986-11eb-9b76-a3fb69f6b928" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dropbox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dropbox photo uploads]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dropbox photo uploads]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TweetDeck could soon look much more like Twitter’s web app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tweetdeck"><ins>TweetDeck</ins></a> is a secret weapon for Twitter power users.

By tapping the lock icon in the address bar (pictured above), you&#39;ll be able to see if you&#39;ve granted a website access to your location, microphone, camera and other sensitive information, and easily toggle those on and off. In the coming weeks, Google also plans to add an option here that will allow you to delete a webpage from your browsing history.

First introduced last year, they&#39;re commands you can type into the address bar to quickly access a feature. For instance, you can write &quot;delete history&quot; to clear your browsing data. A new &quot;safety check&quot; command will tell Chrome to conduct an audit of your passwords, as well as scan for malicious extensions. Chrome will also soon allow you to type &quot;manage security settings&quot; and &quot;manage sync&quot; to access the relevant controls mentioned in those commands.</p><p>Rounding things off, Google has updated Chrome&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-google-chrome-67-site-isolation.html">Site Isolation feature</a> to cover a broader range of websites and extensions. Phishing protection is also improved, with Google claiming it&#39;s 50 times faster and uses less battery life.

Following similar announcements from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-google-messages-212527575.html">T-Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-google-messages-rcs-default-174512924.html">AT&amp;T</a> earlier in the year, Verizon (Engadget&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-messaging-services-android">said today</a> it&#39;s working with Google to bring the next-generation SMS replacement to all of its customers.</p><p>By the end of the year, existing Verizon subscribers who use the carrier&#39;s Message+ app will get full access to the RCS suite, including real-time typing indicators and read receipts. Then, starting next year, all of the company&#39;s phones will come with the <a href="https://messages.google.com/">Messages by Google</a> app preinstalled. Once that happens, RCS perks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-global-rcs-end-to-end-encryption-161130685.html">end-to-end encryption</a> for one-on-one conversations and the ability to send full-resolution photos will be an app away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To say today&#39;s announcement is a significant milestone for Google would be an understatement. The company has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-19-google-chat-rcs-sms-messages-android.html">pushing RCS for years</a>, and at times it seemed like the project was fated to languish like so many of Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-google-allo-messenger-goodbye.html">past mobile messaging efforts</a>. Due to the need for carrier buy-in, the protocol didn&#39;t &quot;just work&quot; like iMessage, at least not initially.&nbsp;</p><p>In the early years, even if you went out of your way to download Google Messages, there was no guarantee you would get any of its promised benefits. That&#39;s because, more often than not, it was likely the person you were texting didn&#39;t have an RCS-capable app installed on their phone, nor were they with a carrier that was onboard with the platform. That meant most Android chats defaulted to SMS. With Google Messages now the default on most new Android phones in the US, that&#39;s a situation that should be the exception, not the norm. Today&#39;s announcement also leaves Apple in an odd position. Once an innovator in the space, the company is now on the outside looking in at a more broadly adopted ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-verizon-rcs-partnership-161912204.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb3062d5-9639-4d64-9d55-1442de08e704</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:19:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626797607</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T16:13:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a3b4e60-e974-11eb-a6ff-944d16bfad7e" width="3000" height="1604" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a3b4e60-e974-11eb-a6ff-944d16bfad7e" width="3000" height="1604" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['District 9' director Neill Blomkamp is helping make a new 'AAA' game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>District 9 </em>director Neill Blomkamp never did get to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-neill-blomkamp-would-still-like-to-do-that-halo-movie-actually.html"><ins>his </ins><em><ins>Halo </ins></em><ins>movie</ins></a>.

Email Protection is now available in beta. It’s a free forwarding service that strips tracking pixels from your emails with the aim of shielding your personal data.</p><p>Around 70 percent of emails contain trackers, DuckDuckGo notes. These can be used to tell the sender when you opened an email, the device you accessed it with and even where you are when you read it. The company notes that trackers can be used for ad targeting as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To use the Email Protection service, you’ll need to sign up for a nifty, free @duck.com email address. DuckDuckGo will extract any trackers from emails sent to that address and forward the messages to your regular inbox. The company says its systems will <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/email/privacy-guarantees">never save emails</a> — not even the sender or recipient&#39;s email address. When you get the email, you&#39;ll be able to see which trackers, if any, DuckDuckGo yanked.</p><p>You can also generate randomized addresses to stop companies from tracking you by email. This part of the service is similar to Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-siri-on-device-app-privacy-181525551.html">Hide My Email</a> option. DuckDuckGo’s approach works across platforms though its app and browser extension.</p><p>If you think a site or app might pummel you with spam or share your email address elsewhere, you can create a disposable address. This could come in handy when you&#39;re signing up for a free trial, for instance. It will also provide a level of protection if that email address is leaked in a data breach. No one would know what email address you use for other services. DuckDuckGo says it’ll be a cinch to deactivate a Private Duck Address if you want to stop receiving any emails through it.</p><p>DuckDuckGo has opened a waitlist for the Email Protection beta and you won’t need to provide any personal information to sign up. You’ll claim your spot in line with a timestamp that’s saved on your device, and you’ll receive a notification when you can snag your @duck.com email address. To register, open the DuckDuckGo iOS or Android app, then go to Settings, Beta Features and Email Protection, then tap the Join the Private Waitlist option.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-email-protection-tracking-pixels-privacy-151024634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8254cf2e-6271-492d-b1ab-0b9e603cb9c7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 15:10:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626805469</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T18:24:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/05b89480-e96a-11eb-bd6e-1588c9a26b9d" width="1590" height="847" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/05b89480-e96a-11eb-bd6e-1588c9a26b9d" width="1590" height="847" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo Email Protection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo Email Protection]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best dorm room essentials for college students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Colleges are returning to their pre-pandemic normal this year, which also means a return to dorm room living. Since this is the first time many of you will be away from home, it’s a good idea to stock up on a few items for your new tiny abode. Not all of our recommendations will be strictly tech-related here because, while tech is important in college (of course), we also wanted to cover the other  essentials that will bring you the comforts of home to your dorm and hopefully make student life less stressful.</p><p>Examples include kitchen items like an adjustable-temp electric kettle, a weighted blanket for reducing anxiety, and a mattress topper that will make that dorm bed much more comfortable. At the same time, you might not want to be in your room forever, which is why we’ve also recommended a few items that could improve your social life, such as a portable Bluetooth speaker for parties and a couple of casual board games. Whether you just want to chill out or make a few friends, we hope this list will help you settle into dorm life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Linenspa foam pillow</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56203-df46-11eb-bdef-485d039d449f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Comfort is key to dorm living, which is why we recommend an oversized reading pillow like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this one from Linenspa" href="https://amzn.to/2VgBPUq">this one from Linenspa</a>. It helps change up your seating position so you’re not in your desk chair all the time, plus it’s a lot more comfortable than just piling up bed pillows against the wall.

It can make a strong, full-bodied cup in just a few minutes, and its plunger-driven design is so simple that even a coffee beginner can use it. It’s small and compact enough for travel and it doesn’t require any electricity, which makes it ideal for camping trips. On top of that, there’s minimal cleaning involved. Equally important, it’s quite affordable at around $30.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Aeropress at Amazon - $32" href="https://amzn.to/2Uz4dAU">Buy Aeropress at Amazon - $32</a></p><h2>Black+Decker Dustbuster Pivot Vac</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cf6e91-df46-11eb-9a56-67435f107a15"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>One of the first lessons you’ll likely learn as a college student is that you’ll have no one to clean up after you. That means doing your own laundry and yes, cleaning your own room. The easiest way to do so is with a handheld vacuum, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Black+Decker 20V Max" href="https://amzn.to/3ACJtbT">Black+Decker 20V Max</a>. It only weighs three pounds so it’s lightweight enough for you to clean your whole room without a lot of fuss. It has a pivoting nozzle which makes it ideal for getting around tight corners and hard-to-reach shelves. Its high-performance motor provides plenty of suction and its 15-ounce capacity is large enough for most dorm rooms. The bowl and filter are removable so you can give them a good wash in between uses. It’s also overall easy to use and fairly affordable, two things you can’t often say about fancy, expensive vacuums.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Black + Decker handheld vacuum at Amazon - $90" href="https://amzn.to/3ACJtbT">Buy Black + Decker handheld vacuum at Amazon - $90</a></p><h2><strong>Anyday Medium Deep Dish</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cf6e90-df46-11eb-bedb-0a4b4cfe01bc" alt="Anyday Medium Deep Dish for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="03230302-0c20-3bc8-bcff-9bd82e3a03af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>You’re probably not allowed to have an Instant Pot in your dorm room, but one kitchen appliance that almost always gets the thumbs up is a microwave. Sure, you can use it to heat up frozen dinners, but why not try it to cook actual dishes as well? <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Anyday&#x002019;s line of microwave cookware" href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">Anyday’s line of microwave cookware</a> lets you do exactly that. Everything is microwave safe, including the stainless steel rim (its smooth and curved shape prevents electrical arcing). Its primary feature is its lid, which has a knob that can vent excess steam when it is lifted. Thanks to this innovation, you can make everything from mac and cheese to a breakfast burrito using only your microwave. For college students, we recommend the medium dish set — they’re sized just right for solo diners.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Medium cookware set at Anyday - $55" href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">Buy Medium cookware set at Anyday - $55</a></p><h2>Bearaby Cotton Napper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d031e0-df46-11eb-97de-a85a909dd10f" alt="Bearaby Cotton Napper for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="31151283-a735-3388-b362-ed94a5f72e43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bearaby</div></figure><p>If you’re like most college students, you’ll probably have your fair share of stress throughout the semester, which can make it harder to get enough sleep.

Unlike other weighted blankets that are filled with tiny glass beads, it’s handmade with a heavy chunky-knit material that feels like a warm hug when wrapped around you. Another bonus is just how gorgeous they look: They come in a variety of luscious colors — from Midnight Blue to Butternut Bliss — and their knit design makes them far more stylish than most weighted blankets on the market. They’ll go well in any decor and are sure to garner plenty of likes on Instagram.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Cotton Napper at Bearaby - $250" href="https://fave.co/3k5P2dd">Buy Cotton Napper at Bearaby - $250</a></p><h2>Lenovo Smart Clock Essential</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d4ecd0-df46-11eb-aa79-6dac8cc0ac61" alt="Lenovo Smart Clock Essential for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="50018997-cb93-3b29-97d2-52133160a42a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Even though you could use your phone as an alarm clock, it’s still useful to have a dedicated device for the task.

Sure, it isn’t nearly as advanced as the Echo Show 5, but if all you want are the alarm clock features, then the Essential should more than suffice. The clock’s 4-inch LED screen shows time in bold digits, and you can ask the Assistant to play music, set timers or create reminders. The integrated nightlight is also a nice touch for those who don’t like to sleep in complete darkness.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Smart Clock Essential at Best Buy - $50" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yRyZWv">Buy Smart Clock Essential at Best Buy - $50</a></p><h2>Lunya Organic Pima sleep mask</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56201-df46-11eb-bb54-60d47704d019" alt="Lunya Organic Prima sleep mask for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="6a12fa34-c1d0-38ff-b202-ce383e01d915"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Roommate pulling an all-nighter with the lights on?

This specific model is especially useful for those who like pour-over coffee due to its gooseneck spout. There’s also a built-in timer to keep track of your brewing process.

For example, if you wanted your team to guess the words “costume,” “web,” and “spider,” you might say “Peter, 3” to indicate that there are three clues on the board that match that word. There are also clues you have to avoid, which makes the game a little harder.

The in-booth layout included a soundbar, subwoofer and two rear satellite speakers. Today, the company announced the first gear that will allow you to actually create something similar at home. The company&#39;s new <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/hta7000">HT-A7000 flagship soundbar</a> offers Dolby Atmos in addition to 360RA and the option to tack on sub and/or extra speakers can accommodate any space. If you&#39;re not so much into soundbars but still want the sensation of immersive audio, Sony also introduced <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/hta9">the HT-A9</a>: a set of four speakers and a control box equipped with new 360 Spatial Sound Mapping tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The HT-A7000 is a 7.1.2-channel soundbar packed with Sony&#39;s X-balanced speakers, side beam tweeters, up-firing drivers for Dolby Atmos and dual subwoofers. Thanks to a Virtual Surround Engine (overhead) and S-Force Pro Front Surround (horizontal), the A7000 can simulate immersive audio on its own so you can take advantage of DTS:X in addition to Atmos. The soundbar is equipped with Sound Field Optimization that uses built-in microphones to calibrate the speaker to a room by detecting the height and width of the space as well as the position of a wireless subwoofer and any rear speakers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="72f06060-abb4-4ccc-babc-6f7049155e08"/><p>When it comes to music, the A7000 accommodates High-Resolution Audio and 360 Reality Audio. In fact, this is the first Sony soundbar to support 360RA and just the third speaker from the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">to do so</a>. The A7000 also has Sony&#39;s DSEE Extreme technology that Sony has leveraged for its headphones. That feature restores some of the compression from streaming services in real time, giving you something akin to lossless audio without the massive file sizes or the need for a wired setup.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of connectivity, the A7000 has HDMI 2.1 with eARC and both 8K and 4K/120fps passthrough — plus Dolby Vision support. The soundbar works with Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect, so you have options when it comes to streaming music from your phone or another device. When used with compatible Bravia TVs, the A7000 works with Sony&#39;s Acoustic Center Sync that allows you to employ your television&#39;s speakers as additional center audio for things like speech clarity. The new soundbar can be controlled by a Google Assistant device at launch and Sony plans to add Alexa compatibility in a future update. Lastly, the company says optional wireless subwoofers and rear speakers will connect automatically to the A7000 when you power them on.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-07-sonys-flagship-soundbar-kicks-out-room-filling-audio.html">the HT-ST5000</a> that it&#39;s replacing, the HT-A7000 soundbar doesn&#39;t come with a subwoofer. Sony says it unbundled the pairing based on customer feedback. Some people wanted the company&#39;s top-of-the-line soundbar, but they weren&#39;t necessarily interested in the sub. It&#39;s a beast in terms of both size and sound, so it&#39;s not ideal for apartments on any room where space is limited. Instead, Sony is offering two subwoofer options — <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw5">the SA-SW5</a> and <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw3">SA-SW3</a> — along with <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sars3s">a pair of rear satellite speakers (SA-RS3S)</a> as separate purchases. All of the add-ons connect to the HT-A7000 wirelessly, with the SW5 offering 300 watts of low-end tone via a 7-inch driver and the SW3 packing 200 watts of bass with a 6-inch speaker.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="593796ae-7a85-46f9-bc14-e17b759a666e"/><p>With the A9 &quot;home theater system,&quot; four cylindrical speakers offer what Sony describes as a &quot;flexible layout&quot; option that&#39;s meant to blend in with your living room decor. Thanks to Sound Field Optimization and built-in mics, the A9 can calibrate itself to any space — just like the tech does for the A7000. A key difference here is that the A9 is also equipped with Sony&#39;s new 360 Spatial Sound Mapping Technology. This feature not only lets you place the four units as you see fit, but it also offers a broad soundstage the company says is more immersive than &quot;traditional&quot; soundbars. Sony explains that the A9 gives users the sensation that the audio is &quot;coming from beyond their walls&quot; by creating up to 12 &quot;phantom&quot; speakers with just the four units. Of course, this is something we&#39;ll have to put the test to double-check the claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Each speaker houses X-balanced front and up-firing speakers along with a tweeter and bass duct. The four devices connect wirelessly to a control box that has HDMI in/out (eARC output) with 8K and 4K/120 passthrough alongside Dolby Vision. The A9 is compatible with immersive formats like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, 360 Reality Audio and High-Resolution Audio. It also works with Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect and you can leverage voice control by pairing the set of speakers with a Google Assistant (at launch) or Alexa (via future update) device. If you need a boost in the center channel, you can use the A9 with compatible Bravia TVs and Sony&#39;s Acoustic Center Sync to employ the speakers from the display. Lastly, both of Sony&#39;s new subwoofers can be paired with the A9 speakers for fuller sound.</p><p>All of Sony&#39;s new home theater gear is set to arrive in &quot;September/October,&quot; according to the company. The HT-A7000 soundbar is $1,300 while the HT-A9 speaker set is $1,800. The SA-SW5 and SA-SW3 subwoofers are $700 and $400 respectively, while the SA-RS3S satellite speakers are $350. That means if you&#39;re expecting to grab a complete setup with the A7000, a soundbar and rear speakers, you&#39;ll need to hand over at least $2,050.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb6bcbd5-02de-43de-b014-ee3965ee3c83</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626783534</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T12:19:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16aba220-e904-11eb-8eef-dbf21f9eb5f7" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16aba220-e904-11eb-8eef-dbf21f9eb5f7" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku sale on Amazon knocks the Streambar down to $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;ve been fans of Roku streaming devices for a long time thanks to their power, versatility and support for most major streaming services. Those looking to make an old TV in their homes smarter, or upgrade an aging streaming gadget, can do so for less now that many Roku devices are on sale at Amazon. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Streambar for $99" href="https://amzn.to/3kD56Du">Roku Streambar for $99</a> — that&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen the compact soundbar that also has built-in 4K streaming capabilities. Also discounted are the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Express" href="https://amzn.to/3eyj0mk">Roku Express</a>, now $25, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Express 4K+" href="https://amzn.to/3wPeBBL">Roku Express 4K+</a>, now $29, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Streaming Stick+" href="https://amzn.to/3xRZRUd">Roku Streaming Stick+</a>, now $39.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Streambar at Amazon - $99" href="https://amzn.to/3kD56Du">Buy Roku Streambar at Amazon - $99</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Express at Amazon - $25" href="https://amzn.to/3eyj0mk">Buy Roku Express at Amazon - $25</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Express 4K+ at Amazon - $29" href="https://amzn.to/3wPeBBL">Buy Roku Express 4K+ at Amazon - $29</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon - $39" href="https://amzn.to/3xRZRUd">Buy Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon - $39</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-review-133013675.html">Roku Streambar</a> is one of those multipurpose gadgets that succeeds at everything it&#39;s designed to do. It&#39;s a soundbar that&#39;s roughly the size of a carton of eggs, which should make it easy to fit into most TV setups. And despite its small size, it packs a punch when it comes to sound quality. The Streambar makes for a solid upgrade for anyone relying on built-in TV speakers, plus it supports Dolby Audio and works as a Bluetooth speaker as well.</p><p>While you could invest in the Streambar purely for its audio chops, it also has built-in Roku 4K streaming technology — that means it&#39;ll act as both your soundbar and set-top box. If you&#39;re not happy with your current smart TV or you have an old, &quot;dumb&quot; TV set that you don&#39;t want to replace just yet, the Roku Streambar is a good (and affordable) way to make it feel new again.</p><p>Those on tighter budgets may find something even better suited for their setup in Roku&#39;s other discounted devices. The Streaming Stick+ has been a favorite of ours for many years because it gives you 4K HDR streaming in a sleek, portable package. If you can compromise on things like long-range wireless connectivity and remote capabilities, the Express or the Express 4K+ are both inexpensive ways to add streaming features to your TV.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-99-deal-amazon-roku-streaming-devices-sale-134034742.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6a0454e3-eb5d-4470-8825-83747d7d1493</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626786719</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T13:12:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9ef272e0-1794-11eb-bffd-21e2290ccd64" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9ef272e0-1794-11eb-bffd-21e2290ccd64" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Streambar soundbar on a white table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Streambar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin completes its first crewed spaceflight with Bezos onboard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin just joined the ranks of private companies that have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">taken people to space</a>.

The New Shepard rocket also touched down in what appeared to be a picture-perfect landing.</p><p>The flight broke multiple records. It included both the oldest-ever astronaut (Funk, 82 years old) and the youngest (Daemen, 18 years old). And while Virgin Galactic did enter space first by NASA&#39;s definition, Blue Origin was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">more than a little keen</a> to point out that its flight was the only one of the two to cross the Kárman line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX was the first of these companies to take people to space through its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-splashdown-record-144301622.html">Crew-1 mission</a>, although it won&#39;t fly an all-civilian crew until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html">later this year</a>. Its space tourism plans so far focus on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-who-is-yusaku-maezawa-spacexs-first-lunar-tourist.html">trips around the Moon</a>, although those aren&#39;t expected to start until 2023.</p><p>The flight clearly involved a large share of bragging rights — it&#39;s yet another instance of a billionaire paying his way into space and marketing his space tourism business. It did represent an important transition for Blue Origin to commercial service after years of uncrewed test flights, though. More importantly, it showed that private human spaceflight is becoming increasingly common. Blue Origin, Virgin and SpaceX were just the vanguards. It&#39;s now just a question of how quickly the industry grows.</p><div id="9f2608b268f74f95b3cc0803abbe8e6a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMHhXzpwupU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64a8a147-b3a9-47e3-b92c-0592ee8d542f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:29:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626812822</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T20:27:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3f6a880-e95d-11eb-afef-b43a9f3d264d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3f6a880-e95d-11eb-afef-b43a9f3d264d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Blue Origin New Shepard capsule touchdown after first human spaceflight]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blue Origin New Shepard capsule touchdown after first human spaceflight]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Arcade's upcoming additions include 'Tetris' and 'Monster Hunter' games]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple Arcade is expanding its game selection, and it once again includes a mix of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-fantasian-interview-apple-arcade-150022942.html">brand new (if familiar) originals</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-arcade-expansion-app-store-greats-131859755.html">well-established classics</a>. The all-you-can-play service will &quot;soon&quot; add <em>Tetris Beat</em>, an Arcade original from N3twork that blends Alexei Pajitnov&#39;s line-clearng puzzles with rhythm game elements. The more you keep to the rhythm, the larger your combos get. The soundtrack includes well-known names like Alison Wonderland and Hannah Diamond, among others, so you might enjoy it just for the music.</p><p>The other upcoming title, <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> (below), will be more than a little familiar — it&#39;s a years-old adaptation of the turn-based Capcom RPG that made its debut on the 3DS. The game flips the usual premise on its head by making you a &quot;rider&quot; that forms ties with some monsters rather than hunting them down.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5c158be0-e955-11eb-be3e-52cf76d3382b" style="height:887;width:1920;" alt="&#39;Monster Hunter Stories&#39; from Apple Arcade on iPhone" data-uuid="6c61c9df-6450-38b6-8332-7b84d6c7a00c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p>Two more veteran games will join the mix.

Like past additions, these latest entries are more about making a stronger overall case for Apple&#39;s $5 per month service — you might be more likely to sign up (or get it as part of an Apple One bundle) if you know titles like <em>Tetris Beat</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> are just a quick download away.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-arcade-tetris-beat-monster-hunter-stories-132138969.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">724b4b11-b192-4b4c-8719-3587ded03e99</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:21:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626787301</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T13:22:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f9737f00-e955-11eb-bdf2-3bd131d11f76" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f9737f00-e955-11eb-bdf2-3bd131d11f76" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[N3twork]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Tetris Beat' from Apple Arcade on an iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Tetris Beat' from Apple Arcade on an iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max drop to $455 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-max-sale-100-off-adorama-184943075.html">Adorama&#39;s sale</a> on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods Max" href="https://amzn.to/3hRsV8x">AirPods Max</a> wireless headphones may have come and gone, but Amazon&#39;s latest sale is almost as good. Every color of Apple&#39;s high-end headphones except for space gray are down to $455 at Amazon right now, and that&#39;s about $94 off their normal price. It&#39;s also only $5 more than a sale we saw at Adorama at the end of last week, so if you missed that chance to grab a pair, you have another opportunity today.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy AirPods Max at Amazon - $455" href="https://amzn.to/3hRsV8x">Buy AirPods Max at Amazon - $455</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of our biggest gripes with the AirPods Max is their price. Normally $550, these are the best headphones Apple has to offer — but despite how much we liked them, we still thought they were on the steep side. We recommend waiting for a sale before taking the plunge as AirPods Max are a much better buy when discounted like this.</p><p>They earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">score of 84</a> from us in part due to their excellent sound, solid ANC and reliable touch controls. AirPods Max have more balanced sound than competitors, with bass that comes through nicely but isn&#39;t overpowering. The active noise-cancellation on these cans holds its own against that of Bose and Sony devices, even if we slightly prefer the latter two for that feature. The Max also have Transparency Mode, allowing you to easily hop in and out of conversations when necessary. And you&#39;re getting spatial audio support on iPhones, iPads, Macs and soon, Apple TV as well.</p><p>All of that plus the Max&#39;s unique yet elegant design make them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html">solid wireless headphones</a>, but features brought by their built-in H1 chip make them even better for those living in the Apple ecosystem. In addition to hands-free Siri, you&#39;ll also get quick pairing and switching between all your Apple devices. While still expensive at this sale price, the AirPods Max are a good option for Apple lovers that want a pair of wireless headphones that both sound great and work seamlessly with their devices.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-max-deal-455-amazon-125146678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f45377e8-7967-4a42-acae-af260c64868d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:51:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626784932</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T12:42:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0d1209b0-e955-11eb-9bf6-9f7105bc098b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0d1209b0-e955-11eb-9bf6-9f7105bc098b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple&#39;s AirPods Max drop to $455 at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best budget TVs and streaming gadgets for students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Listen up, students: You can do better than watching movies on your laptop in bed.

A year after the release of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-17-louis-vuitton-true-wireless-earbuds.html">$1,000 earbuds</a>, the French fashion house&#39;s latest stab at audio is as eccentric as they come. The new LV Horizon Light Up Speaker looks like a spaceship sculpted by aliens to resemble a sawn-off spinning top. What&#39;s more, it costs $2,890, but you knew it wouldn&#39;t come cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by its Toupie handbag, the speaker lights up to accentuate the brand&#39;s flower insignia and a spelled out Louis Vuitton around the center. There&#39;s also a top ring light with 23 LEDs that puts on a rainbow color show. The neons combined with the black perforated and embossed leather is best described as cyber-chic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/51d1ca00-e954-11eb-9eee-f35ca07b8f5b" alt="Louis Vuitton" data-uuid="8b659fa7-7d75-3d9f-80b3-5b9115e1e05b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Louis Vuitton</div></figure><p>But, if you&#39;re going to splurge just shy of $3,000 on a speaker, you probably want it to sound good. The Horizon features a 3-inch woofer paired with two 0.75-inch tweeters that LV says combine to offer 360-degree sound. Though, the jury&#39;s out on whether it can match the immersive audio touted by the likes of the $700 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-srs-ra5000-review-150011735.html">Sony SRS-RA5000</a>. If the mid-range Qualcomm QCS 404 chipset inside is anything to go by, it may not offer the big sound you&#39;d associate with its price tag. It also comes with three mics in case you want to take calls on the glowing mothership on your desk.</p><p>The conical shape means the speaker sits on its side, which doesn&#39;t impact the sound as it can apparently &quot;adapt to its orientation.&quot; Just don&#39;t leave it on a sloping surface. To avoid any (expensive) accidents, the Horizon comes with an accompanying dock that you can rest it in. Being wireless, it works with Bluetooth and supports Apple AirPlay to boot.

The company claims to be North America&#39;s largest e-bike brand with 350,000 riders on the road. Those figures helped it to secure $150 million in <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/04/rad-power-bikes-raises-150-million-as-electric-bike-sales-boom/">funding</a> from big name investors like Morgan Stanley earlier this year. Naturally, it&#39;s using that cash to do what it does best: Make more e-bikes. Rad&#39;s latest offering is the $1,999 RadRover 6 Plus, an overhauled version of its flagship durable bike.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5127ba40-e947-11eb-8bdd-35e3a72480ef" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="RadRover 6 Plus" data-uuid="62da6efa-de10-393d-93bf-6d406b8f15cb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rad Power Bikes</div></figure><p>The first thing you&#39;ll probably notice are the fat tires, an attribute carried over from the first iteration in 2015. But, look closer and you should spot several noticeable changes. Firstly, there are the all-new hydraulic disc brakes for more stopping power (a first for a Rad bike). The plus-sized RadRover also features a custom geared hub motor that provides 750W of power, compared to 500W on the $999 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rad-power-launches-a-lightweight-ebike-for-999-140004049.html">RadMission Electric Metro Bike</a> and $1,099 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rad-power-bikes-radmission-electric-bicycle-review-120020625.html">RadMission 1.</a> For off-road enthusiasts, that apparently means the bike can climb hills 25 percent faster than its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here, the battery is also semi-integrated instead of external. That effectively allows you to swap it out with the turn of a key. A new two-part display, meanwhile, shows real-time stats such as battery charge status, power output, trip mileage, time and a headlight indicator.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/86aa9c50-e947-11eb-bc7f-4b3aa88da49f" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="RadRover 6 Plus" data-uuid="8677c1d7-9471-38b1-ac4f-219b105857f3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rad Power Bikes</div></figure><p>Overall, Rad pitches the new RadRover as its everyday bike that&#39;s versatile enough for grocery trips, commutes and trails. Which may explain why it costs more than some of its lightweight alternatives. In keeping with its focus on flexibility, the e-bike has two frame sizes (high-step and step-thru) to cater to a wider range of heights. The RadRover 6 Plus is available to pre-order today in the US and Canada.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/radrover-6-plus-ebike-120056788.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da495c4c-04a9-4f99-8f08-e1c978dd48ff</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 12:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626779052</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T11:04:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1df69490-e940-11eb-9737-afa020043d52" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1df69490-e940-11eb-9737-afa020043d52" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rad Power Bikes]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rad Power Bikes]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rad Power Bikes]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Blue Origin’s first crewed spaceflight at 9AM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeff Bezos is about to go to space, along with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-tourist-flight-123407896.html">his brother</a> Mark and the youngest and oldest people to venture above the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">Kármán line</a>.

It&#39;s perhaps most famous for being the watch worn by Ripley and other characters from the 1979 movie <em>Alien</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="35cc8fcdb0034308b396a46fdf5c2577"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YwNRscWmf2w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The A100WEPC reprises that with the same four-button layout. At the same time, the watch face features the Pac-Man and ghost characters, with the center illuminator logo rendered with the Pac-Man font. The face replicates the Pac-Man game screen, while the top watch band is laser etched with a Pac-Man character being chased by ghosts, with the reverse on the bottom band. It comes with special packaging featuring the Pac-Man characters and game score screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Casio&#39;s watch isn&#39;t the first with a Pac-Man theme, as the $79 Timex T80 x Pac-Man also fetes the retro title. However, since Casio pairs it with a watch design from the same period, it&#39;s perhaps a bit more desirable for fans of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>The base AW100WE model, which <a href="https://www.g-central.com/all-new-casio-a100-is-a-tribute-to-the-f-100-watch-from-alien/">came out last month</a>, offers water resistance, a 1/10 second stopwatch, daily alarm, hourly time signal, auto-calendar and LED light. It&#39;s scheduled to be released in August in Japan for ¥12,100, or about $110 — a relative bargain for enthusiastic Pac-Man fans.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/casio-unveils-the-pac-man-edition-a-100-digital-watch-113542602.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2055f840-25e3-4448-955b-32fa9c6c019f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 11:35:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626780746</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T11:32:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4dfa2b90-e948-11eb-96ff-825c767167ab" width="1840" height="953" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4dfa2b90-e948-11eb-96ff-825c767167ab" width="1840" height="953" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Casio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casio unveils the Pac-Man edition A100 digital watch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Casio unveils the Pac-Man edition A100 digital watch]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
