The partnership will kick off with a display debonder, a display rebonder, and a battery cover.</p><p>The models these Microsoft-sanctioned tools are designed for aren&#39;t the friendliest to at-home tinkering.

Whether that&#39;s firmware upgrades for its hardware or feature dumps for its plugins. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-3-free-update-super-synth-vst-hands-on-163304649.html">Pigments</a>, the company&#39;s all original virtual synth (as opposed to its meticulous emulations of classic hardware), has been one of the biggest benefactors of these free updates. Today the company is launching Pigments 3.5 another significant upgrade to what I have said repeatedly is my favorite soft synth at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>While this isn&#39;t quite as large an update as 3.0, it still brings a lot of new features to the table. One of the one most important is that Pigments 3.5 adds compatibility with Apple&#39;s M1 chips. This isn&#39;t exactly a flashy new feature, but it will make many producers very happy who have already jumped on the hype train for the latest MacBooks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c58dc4693cc24d3db241d4099adf7a65"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF2Sts-U8Zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The biggest change to the synth engine itself is probably the addition of a cross modulation feature. You can use either engine one or two as the mod source and dial in results that range from subtle weirdness to full on sonic freak outs. Arturia also fleshed out its comb filter which has three new modes (LP6, BP6 and HP6) that cleans up certain frequencies excelling at plucks and bowed sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Arturia also added a new distortion module to the effects section. While there have been options for adding dirt in Pigments before, this is a lot more versatile of an option. It has 16 different modes with built-in filtering for creating everything from the germanium fuzz of classic guitar pedals, to extreme digital wavefolding or even the soft saturation you&#39;d get from a vintage preamp.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that&#39;s not enough new sound design options for you, there are dozens of new wavetables being added too, plus over 150 new presets that show off the power of the new features.</p><p>Lastly, Arturia made some tweaks to the UI that should streamline the workflow, including one-click sample preview.&nbsp;</p><p>Pigments 3.5 is available now as a free upgrade for current owners. If you haven&#39;t picked up Pigments yet, now is a pretty good time to, since it&#39;s <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/pigments/overview#en">on sale for $99</a> until January 6th. And Arturia is even including three new sound banks for free — Bass Thermal, Trap Chemical and EDM Kinetic.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-free-upgrade-soft-synth-35-m1-support-161634255.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">29a066c9-fd0d-4cb1-bb4d-6751bff3b43d</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:16:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639498599</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T16:16:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/457df450-5cf8-11ec-aeb3-d1934bfe7a95" width="2847" height="1723" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/457df450-5cf8-11ec-aeb3-d1934bfe7a95" width="2847" height="1723" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia Pigments 3.5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia Pigments 3.5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The US Postal Service secretly tested a blockchain mobile voting system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-seattle-area-smartphone-vote.html">Mobile voting</a> hasn&#39;t had much traction in the US, but that apparently isn&#39;t for a lack of trying. The US Postal Service has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/13/usps-built-secretly-tested-mobile-voting-system-before-2020/">confirmed</a> to <em>The Washington Post</em> that it secretly developed and tested a blockchain-based mobile voting system ahead of the 2020 election. The project was purely &quot;exploratory&quot; and was abandoned in 2019 after University of Colorado researchers discovered security flaws, including the risks of impersonation, denial of service attacks and &quot;techniques&quot; that compromised privacy.</p><p>However, it might be the lack of transparency that raises the most concern. The USPS didn&#39;t coordinate with other federal agencies, and it asked the university to sign a non-disclosure deal that prevented them from naming the institution involved. Election security officials just learning of the blockchain voting project were worried it might erode trust in the democratic system already hurt by unsupported claims of significant fraud during the 2020 vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Postal Service has considered electronic voting before, but centered its attention on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-02-west-virginia-disabled-vote-by-smartphone.html">those who can&#39;t easily vote</a>, such as soldiers and people with disabilities. This was a practical exercise that could have applied to a large swath of voters, not just a small group that can&#39;t realistically use mail or in-person balloting.</p><p>The end result was the same with or without the test: the 2020 election continued to rely on paper ballots, and federal agencies focused more on establishing a paper trail to reduce the chances of Russia and other actors from tampering with the vote. The revelation shows there wasn&#39;t a completely united front, though, and suggests vote-by-smartphone efforts aren&#39;t about to take off any time soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-postal-service-blockchain-mobile-voting-test-160914015.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be8b201e-e882-4514-aadc-dd334d3346e6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:09:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639500078</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T16:41:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1c6efec0-5cf2-11ec-b9dd-e0231d4ad05e" width="7834" height="5226" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1c6efec0-5cf2-11ec-b9dd-e0231d4ad05e" width="7834" height="5226" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Election worker Tommy Rose wears protective gear as he collects mail-in ballots at the Registrar of Voters on the day of the U.S. Presidential election in San Diego, California, U.S., November 3, 2020.

Dell said that if it incorporated all the design ideas, it could reduce a computer&#39;s carbon footprint by up to 50 percent compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-17-review-2020-170006738.html">current</a> laptop models.</p><p>A key feature of Concept Luna is the redesigned components and a new, more efficient layout. To start with, the motherboard is 75 percent smaller at just 5,580 square millimeters and has a 20 percent lower component count. Everything is rearranged, with the motherboard close to the top cover to expose it to a larger cooling area. It&#39;s also separated from the battery charging unit in the base, allowing better passive cooling that could eliminate the need for a fan.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7394b270-5cdf-11ec-addf-374dafe61241" style="height:991;width:1800;" alt="Dell Concept Luna recycle reuse repair" data-uuid="00550fca-7136-3867-a19a-e479a685c80d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>The extra efficiencies also reduce power requirements, allowing the designers to use a smaller battery with deep-cycle cells that offer a &quot;long charge that can be maintained across many years of use, increasing refurbishment and reuse beyond the first product life it services,&quot; Dell said.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of making the design more power efficient, Dell designers used less energy-intensive materials that are easier to recycle. The aluminum body, for instance, was processed using hydro power and a more efficient stamped construction. Dell also reduced the number of screws by tenfold, &quot;with just four needed to access internal components.&quot; That not only reduces material count, but repair time (to disassemble, repair and reassemble key components) by around 1.5 hours.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e04e5630-5ce1-11ec-af7a-7fef67ee9d65" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Dell&#39;s Concept Luna shows how future PCs could be easier to repair and recycle" data-uuid="c68353d3-805c-38ec-9df5-7ef6f1ac3cc5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Other features include a palm rest that&#39;s easy to repair and reuse, a keyboard mechanism that can be easily separated for replacement and recycling, and a bio-based printed circuit board (PCB) made with flax fiber in the base and water-soluble polymer as glue. &quot;What&#39;s notable here is that the flax fiber replaces traditional plastic laminates...

Unfortunately, America’s decades-long love affair with performing the absolute bare minimum of basic infrastructure maintenance has left many stretches of the nation’s highway lane markers faded, damaged and obscured. A new pilot program from Honda Research Institute USA could one day help local highway and traffic departments keep a closer eye on the state of the roads in their care, using the cars travelling upon them.</p><p>The Honda Road Condition Monitoring System leverages the cameras and GPS navigation systems already found in many of today’s automobiles to monitor the real-time conditions of roads and detect potential hazards. The onboard system will evaluate each stretch of lane marker as green, yellow, grey and red. Green and yellow denote ideal or good quality lane markers, while red indicates markers in need of repair and grey means that there are no markers present at all (like on city streets or rural roads).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7cc48c26503741b28b213e3c9ff1a95b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5DhN1yCYk0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The system captures road conditions using the vehicle’s cameras and other sensors, coordinating that feed with the onboard GPS to provide exact locations of any hazards or damage and then uploads that data to a secure server. Once the data is in the cloud, local highway and transportation departments will be able to access it through a web portal to see which stretches of roadway need to be repaired or repainted most urgently.</p><p>“We regularly inspect our roadways throughout Ohio and act quickly to address any issues, like faded or damaged pavement markings, that are identified. It’s a labor-intensive process. Good pavement markings are important to the drivers of today and the vehicles of tomorrow,” Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks said in a statement Monday. “We’re excited to work with Honda to improve the process.”</p><p>Honda is working with the Ohio Department of Transportation for its upcoming pilot program, which is slated to begin early next year. During that study, obviously only select Honda vehicles will be recording datam, “to help enhance the efficiency of the road maintenance operation in Ohio,” according to a Monday press release. The research institute is looking to eventually connect entire fleets of Honda and Acura vehicles, allowing them to share data via V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) networks and provide real-time updates to their ADA systems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-is-piloting-a-road-monitoring-system-to-spot-faded-lane-markers-141527660.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9030d567-732b-48aa-bcc1-a68f2de71e72</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 14:15:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639421816</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T18:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Luis Sinco via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - NOV. 24, 2021.

With so much of our lives driven by our devices, gadgets that help keep smartphones and tablets going will be useful to almost anyone. Anker makes some of our favorite mobile accessories and Amazon has a one-day-only sale going on that knocks <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:up to 36 percent off" href="https://amzn.to/3dSiZc6">up to 36 percent off</a> some of the company&#39;s latest devices. A bunch of gadgets in the new MagGo lineup have been discounted, including the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:gray 5,000mAh magnetic battery pack" href="https://amzn.to/3oSJ2GB">gray 5,000mAh magnetic battery pack</a>, which is 25 percent off and down to $45, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:magnetic desktop charging station" href="https://amzn.to/3IODHIg">magnetic desktop charging station</a>, which is also 25 percent off and on sale for $75.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3dSiZc6" id="bb1974bb7eaf460e97b99d3dea85826f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Anker one-day sale at Amazon</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oSJ2GB" id="966b8532a8734c869f2eceb06ad54423" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagGo battery pack at Amazon - $45</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3IODHIg" id="a281d7849751486898fd50a7c90d635b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagGo desktop charging station at Amazon - $75</a><p>All of the accessories in the MagGo collection work with the latest iPhones that have MagSafe, meaning they&#39;ll snap onto the back of the handsets to provide power, extra grip and more. The 5,000mAh battery pack will come in handy for those constantly on the go as it snaps to the back of iPhone 13s and provides up to 17 hours of additional juice. It also has a built-in kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while it&#39;s wirelessly charging. We also appreciate that it doesn&#39;t add much heft to the iPhone, measuring just 12.8mm thick, and that you can use it with MagSafe-compatible phone cases, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you know someone who could stand to clean up their nightstand a bit, Anker&#39;s MagGo desktop charging station could do the trick. It looks similar to Amazon&#39;s now-discontinued Echo Spot, but with a powerful magnetic pad instead of a smart display. The orb magnetically holds on to your iPhone, positioning it at an angle that makes it easy to see and use the screen. On its back, it has a bunch of ports: three AC outlets, two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. That lets you plug in almost any other gadget you have lying around like a tablet or your smartwatch, and it keeps all of your cables mostly out of the way. Its small size and cute design make it a good choice as a catch-all charging device for your nightstand or the desk in your home office.</p><p>While the sale mostly includes magnetic accessories, there are a few standard charging gadgets included, too. Anker&#39;s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nano Pro 20W USB-C charger" href="https://amzn.to/3IShgSG">Nano Pro 20W USB-C charger</a> is 25 percent off, bringing it down to $15, while a pack of 3-, 6- and 10-foot <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cables" href="https://amzn.to/3DRB5Wb">Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cables</a> is 36 percent off, knocking it down to just under $30.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/california-halts-ponyais-driverless-testing-permit-after-accident-2021-12-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the DMV suspended its driverless testing permit on November 19th, a few weeks after a reported collision in Fremont. Based on the report filed with the state&#39;s DMV, a Pony.ai vehicle operating autonomously hit a road center divider and a traffic sign on October 28th.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a single vehicle incident, and there were no injuries and other vehicles involved. As <em>Reuters</em> said, it&#39;s unclear what aspect of the accident prompted the DMV to suspend Pony.ai&#39;s permit, but the company said it immediately launched an investigation and is working with the agency to figure out what caused the collision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Pony.ai won&#39;t be able to test fully autonomous vehicles in California anymore, it can continue its trials with safety drivers behind the wheel. The company has 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles registered for testing and only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/">secured</a> its driverless testing permit six months ago for three cities in the state. It&#39;s the eighth company to receive that kind of permit in California, following the likes of Waymo, Cruise and Baidu. Under the terms of the permit, Pony.ai was given permission to conduct driverless tests in Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine on open roads and with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Further, the vehicles could only operate in clear weather and light precipitation.</p><p>Pony.ai recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005790/en/Pony.ai-Receives-Approval-for-Paid-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Services-in-Beijing">received</a> approval to run paid autonomous taxi services in Beijing, which it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">hoping to achieve</a> in California by 2022. It remains to be seen whether this suspension will delay those plans considerably.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-suspends-ponyai-driverless-testing-permit-122914859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6daaca69-fb69-4900-8613-d50ce4e9e7d7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:29:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639488776</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T13:33:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/32385680-5ce2-11ec-8eff-676c992f1f6d" width="1590" height="903" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/32385680-5ce2-11ec-8eff-676c992f1f6d" width="1590" height="903" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pony.ai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A white Pony.ai autonomous vehicle is seen driving down a roadway with browning fall foliage in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pony.ai autonomous vehicle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Analogue Pocket could be the definitive retro handheld]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After teasing, delaying and just generally riling up retro gamers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-first-look-handheld-gaming-as-good-as-it-ever-was-160050430.html">Analogue’s Pocket</a> is almost here.

Toyota confirmed to <em>The Drive</em> that you&#39;ll need a paid subscription on every 2018 and newer Toyota model to use the function.</p><p>Complicating the situation is that most buyers received a free three-year or 10-year Remote Connect trial depending on whether they had the Audio Plus or Premium Audio trim options. So for at least the first three years of ownership, the remote key fob start method would have worked without a hitch — but it&#39;s now expiring for 2018 models.</p><p>The issue was originally spotted by car shopping site <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/posts/toyota-rav4-remote-start/"><em>CoPilot</em></a> last summer. Owners are particularly irked that Toyota has linked the key fob remote start function to Remote Connect, since the key fob doesn&#39;t require an app in any way. What might be extra galling is that the limitation doesn&#39;t apply to pre-2018 cars, because Toyota didn&#39;t want to update them from 3G to LTE networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota isn&#39;t the first automaker to charge for key features on top of the price of the car. Mercedes also <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/automotive-news/mercedes-benz-eqs-rear-wheel-steer-requires-subscription">requires a subscription</a> in Europe for rear-wheel steering in its new EQS electric car. And after charging buyers a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-bmw-adds-a-80-yearly-subscription-for-apples-carplay.html">monthly fee</a> for Apple CarPlay, BMW <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-04-bmw-apple-carplay-waives-subscription-fee.html">backtracked</a> and included the feature for free.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94790a4c-8b89-4062-b4b4-4659d6123acd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:16:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491117</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:13:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG’s StanbyME is a wireless TV on wheels]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is slated to showcase two lifestyle TVs with unusual designs at CES 2022, one of which is the recently announced premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED Evo TV with motorized cover</a>. The other? It&#39;s a smaller wireless TV with built-in battery called StanbyME that you can roll in and out of any room in your home. The 27-inch display is mounted on a moveable stand with concealed wheels, and you can adjust its height to customize its position for whatever you&#39;re using it for. You can also swivel and rotate its screen to either portrait or landscape orientation.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, LG said that since you can adjust its position as needed, you can use it in your kitchen while cooking or in your bedroom or the sofa while lounging. And you can, unless you&#39;re planning on not getting up for hours to binge on your favorite series — the TV only lasts for three hours of viewing before it needs a recharge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite that limitation, you can use the StanbyME to view whatever content you want using the apps it supports, which include Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video. You can also take advantage of its mobile screen mirroring capability with your Android or iOS phone and NFC. The model has a removable mobile cradle on top, so you can use it to take video calls or attend online classes. Plus, you can use it as a screen for your laptop or PC via wireless connection or by using USB or HDMI.</p><p>The model will come with a remote control you can use for navigation, but it&#39;ll also be able to recognize touch and gesture commands. LG also says that it has a unique US that&#39;s &quot;tailored to the viewer&#39;s personal viewing experience.&quot; The manufacturer didn&#39;t explain what it meant by that, but we&#39;ll find out for sure in January at CES.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868ba710-2568-41b4-906e-1db2b7097d14</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491156</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The other innovation in LGâs new Lifestyle TV lineup, LG StanbyME, is the ideal companion for todayâs TV viewing habits.

Following last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-093038483.html">Oppo AR Glass</a> concept, the new Oppo Air Glass will become available to Chinese consumers in Q1 2022 for a yet-to-be-announced price. It&#39;ll come in two parts: a detachable monocle waveguide device (in black or white) and either a silver half frame or a black full frame. And no, you won&#39;t be able to attach this 30-gram device to your own glasses.</p><div id="f427458c2c774c029fa3ea5e5f2d84ae"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMQUDSk_4B0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Much like Google Glass, Oppo Air Glass is designed to deliver simple information for use cases such as navigation, translation, teleprompter, calendar, weather, fitness tracking and more. Oppo calls this &quot;assisted reality,&quot; which keeps the package portable yet practical and accessible. This is achieved using a power-efficient &quot;Spark Micro Projector,&quot; which comes in at roughly the size of a single coffee bean, and it houses a Micro LED chip to project a bright 640 x 480 image onto a waveguide display — one that&#39;s larger than that of Google Glass.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b4c08b80-5cbb-11ec-bdae-82e193e172f1" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="4337b49e-da54-36c5-b3fc-c29fe8de21a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo Air Glass is driven by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-spaces-ar-xr-platform-163552229.html">Qualcomm</a> Snapdragon Wear 4100, which is similar to the chip inside some of the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a> and TicWatch smartwatches.

However, only Chinese, English and Japanese are supported at the moment, with Korean to follow soon.</p><p>For the navigation app, Oppo worked with Baidu to integrate Baidu Walk &amp; Bike Navigation as well as Explore Nearby. Don&#39;t expect any sophisticated AR graphics here; users will simply see step-by-step navigation based on one&#39;s location and orientation, and voice command is supported (presumably only in Chinese).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6117c000-5cc2-11ec-bfff-b115e4db4904" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="7849d205-bf1d-3b10-98c3-713b96577acc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>An Oppo rep added that the Air Glass is the result of two previous designs, which allowed the company to work with developers to build up an ecosystem. In addition, the Chinese company will soon release a Smart Glass SDK to let more developers — potentially those from overseas as well — into the party.</p><p>Considering how other companies such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-three-new-frames-131152809.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-frames-pacific-blue-quartz-grey-announcement-130020269.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-augmented-reality-spectacles-selfie-drone-190800775.html">Snap</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-review-price-specs-available-now-162556863.html">Razer</a> have been focusing on either audio- or camera-based smartglasses, Oppo&#39;s strategy with its Air Glass is certainly a bit of a surprise. For now, this is all rather experimental for Oppo, as the device will only be launched in China in a limited quantity, with each labelled with a unique edition number on its package.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-air-glass-assisted-reality-wearable-xr-ar-095617424.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06443428-820d-44be-b921-f12f0bc8bd96</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 09:56:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491512</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:18:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oppo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV may lose ESPN, ABC, FX and other Disney channels this week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube TV has warned viewers that channels including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-22-espn-lost-two-million-subscribers.html">ABC, ESPN, FX</a> and others may disappear by 11:59 PM on December 17th if it can&#39;t come to terms with Disney over carriage fees.

Now, the footwear and sports apparel giant has acquired a startup called RTFKT (pronounced &quot;artifact&quot;) that will help the company accelerate its &quot;digital transformation.&quot; RTFKT was founded in early 2020 and has since made a name for itself designing and creating what it calls &quot;Metaverse-ready sneakers and collectibles&quot; — all digital goods people pay very real money for.&nbsp;</p><p>The market for virtual goods is booming, and it&#39;s expected to continue growing as we move towards the metaverse, the future vision for the internet wherein people can interact in a virtual world with digital avatars. To that end, Nike seems to have big plans for RTFKT and its team, which will be joining the company. John Donahoe, Nike&#39;s President and CEO, said: &quot;We&#39;re acquiring a very talented team of creators with an authentic and connected brand.

In 2022, Amazon reportedly plans to bring the service to the US and the majority of Europe.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the specifics of its plans but did share a statement with Engadget. “Our focus is on providing Amazon customers the best possible experience when it comes to grocery delivery whether that is from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, or one of our local stores like Bartell’s in Seattle, Morrison’s in London, or Monoprix in Paris,” a spokesperson for the company said. “Partnerships with other grocers enable more customers to shop online and allow us to provide Amazon Prime members with more choice, value and convenience while our partners benefit from increased visibility for their selection and service.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the service does come to the US, it wouldn’t be Amazon’s first foray into the grocery delivery market.

The company has also more broadly experimented with food delivery. The most notable example was in 2015 when it launched Amazon Restaurants, allowing Prime members to order food from their favorite local spots.

Depending on the battery size and drive type, prospective buyers should expect to pay between $39,700 and $54,500 for one of their own.</p><p>The Ioniq 5 will be available in three trim levels — SE, SEL, and Limited — and come with either a 77.4kWh pack, which is rated for 303 miles of range using RWD (256 miles with AWD), or a smaller 58-kWh battery with 220 miles of range.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don&#39;t expect to see any of the smaller battery models on US roads to start. Hyundai is initially focusing on producing units with the larger battery pack and saving the 220 mile, 168 HP SE Standard Range until spring 2022. The 303-mile, 225HP rear motor SE starts at $43,650 ($47,150 for the 320 HP, AWD version, the RWD SEL will cost $45,900 ($49,500 for AWD) and the top of the line Limited will go for $50,600 as an RWD ($54,500 for AWD). Optional features and a $1,225 freight charges are of course extra.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyundai&#39;s pricing point puts the Ioniq 5 on par with the 2021 Kia Niro EV, which starts at $39,090, and the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 with its $39,995 MSRP — even if you splurge for the Ioniq&#39;s higher trim levels, you&#39;ll only begin to stray into, say, the Mach-E&#39;s introductory price range ($42,895 for the base, $48,100 for Premium, and a smooth $60k for a GT).&nbsp;</p><p>Will the Ioniq 5&#39;s performance live up to the hype?

The twisters also touched down in December, well outside the normal tornado season. While this may have been an unusually extreme weather event for many reasons, Amazon&#39;s decision to schedule its workers during potentially deadly conditions isn&#39;t. Reportedly, at the time the cyclone touched down in warehouse&#39;s parking lot — producing winds estimated at 155 miles per hour — the facility was not only operating, but undergoing <a href="https://news.stlpublicradio.org/2021-12-11/at-least-6-people-died-after-tornado-struck-amazon-warehouse-in-edwardsville">a shift change</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon operates a staggering number of fulfillment, sortation and delivery centers across the country, and as a result, some of them are bound to be taken by surprise by the forces of nature. Excessive <a href="https://www.wfmz.com/news/area/berks/bowing-roof-prompts-evacuation-of-amazon-warehouse/article_8b954488-663c-11eb-811d-d785ef6d9b2a.html">snow</a> on the roof of one warehouse in Pennsylvania resulted in an evacuation when workers noticed the it buckling.

But its operating standards have produced a pattern of incidents where workers were expected to clock in during extreme weather events. Warehouses <a href="https://gizmodo.com/new-york-amazon-employees-had-to-work-during-deadly-flo-1847606546">stayed open</a> during tropical depression Ida in September, the torrential rains of which caused widespread flooding and led to 14 deaths in New York. Some of Amazon&#39;s drivers told me they were delivering packages through the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-last-mile-1820451224">floodwaters</a> of hurricane Irma back in 2017.</p><p>The Camp Fire of 2018 was the deadliest and costliest wildfire in California&#39;s history. Smoke from the destruction also briefly made Sacramento the <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/cat6/Smoke-Camp-Fire-Making-Sacramento-Most-Polluted-City-Earth">most polluted city on earth</a>. Despite air quality warnings being <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/weather/camp-fire-air-quality-concerns-in-parts-of-northern-california/103-612752864">issued</a> for the city on November 8th, an Amazon warehouse there did not send its workers home until the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/california-wildfires/article/Amazon-package-delays-Sacramento-closed-smoke-13398895.php">afternoon of the 10th</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By far, however, the most pervasive issue across Amazon&#39;s warehouses has been extreme heat. Workers in the Pacific Northwest were <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/heat-wave-daily-news-updates-june-27-what-to-know-about-the-heat-dome-across-the-pacific-northwest/#update-13991692">expected</a> to report for duty during a historic heatwave this past summer which was eventually deemed a mass casualty event.

New York warehouse workers also <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse">reported</a> fainting and excessive heat around the same time. In May of this year, excessive heat led to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/amazon-warehouse-worker-dies-in-bessemer-alabama?sref=10lNAhZ9">death</a> inside the company&#39;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>These are only some of the most recent examples. Workers have been lodging similar complaints for at least a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2011-09-23-ct-biz-0923-bf-amazon-heat-20110923-story.html">decade</a> about dangerous temperatures inside Amazon&#39;s facilities in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-protests-chicago-heat-wave">Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/amazon-flex-portland-warehouse-working-conditions/">Portland</a> and Pennsylvania&#39;s <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/watchdog/mc-allentown-amazon-complaints-20110917-story.html">Lehigh Valley</a>, among others. Even when immediate symptoms like fainting, <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1934110/rising-heat-is-making-workers-sick">vomiting</a> or heat stroke are not present, long term heat exposure can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-safety-crisis-could-be-heat-waves-1847188930">exacerbate</a> existing health problems such as heart conditions and asthma.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this speaks to criticisms of Amazon&#39;s safety measures related to <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coworkers-react-after-amazon-worker-from-tracy-facility-dies-from-coronavirus/103-20b2999e-c450-4553-89aa-bcb084ba8b02">COVID-19</a>, or its objectively sky-high <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/01/amazon-osha-injury-rate/">injury rate</a> compared to other warehousing operations.</p><p>What&#39;s concerning is that, according to the overwhelming majority of the scientific community, severe winds, rain and heat are likely to get worse due to man-made climate change. Amazon, however, has not offered a satisfactory explanation for why it continues to schedule shifts during potentially deadly weather, nor would it provide Engadget with any details of the extreme weather plan in effect at the Edwardsville facility.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re deeply saddened by the news that members of our Amazon family passed away as a result of the storm in Edwardsville, IL,&quot; an Amazon spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their loved ones, and everyone impacted by the tornado.

When it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-monterey-release-facetime-safari-shareplay-171102479.html"><ins>released macOS Monterey in October</ins></a>, Apple said that feature and SharePlay would arrive on Macs later in the fall.

Still, it&#39;s better to make sure the feature is working correctly instead of releasing a potentially buggy version.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it does arrive, the feature will be available on MacBook and Macbook Pro (2016 and later), the 2019 Mac Pro, MacBook Air (2018 and later), iMac (2017 and later) and the 5K Retina 27-inch iMac from late 2015. As for supported tablets, you&#39;ll be able to use iPad Pro, iPad Air (3rd generation and later), iPad (6th generation and later) and iPad mini (5th generation and later) with Universal Control.</p><p>You&#39;ll need to be logged into iCloud with the same Apple ID on all devices. You can connect them over USB, or you can use Universal Control wirelessly as long as the devices are within 30 feet of each other.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-universal-control-feature-mac-ipad-delayed-202744636.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8dac51f-0f22-47df-940a-3dc5d7370187</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 20:27:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639427267</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T20:27:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8d832d30-c7be-11eb-b7d7-79b626b77a96" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8d832d30-c7be-11eb-b7d7-79b626b77a96" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Universal Control on macOS Monterey]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Universal Control on macOS Monterey]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
