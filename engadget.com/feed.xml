You could get in touch on a remote camping trip without any cell service, and without buying a separate satellite communicator.</p><p>The iPhone would supposedly use a modified version of Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-qualcomm-snapdragon-x60-5g-mmwave-qtm535-ultrasaw-rf-filter.html">X60 modem</a> to talk to satellites. It&#39;s not certain if satellite support would be limited to certain apps, although we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the case. Mobile satellite service is often far slower than conventional cellular data, ruling out many of the internet-intensive apps people take for granted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s good reason to be skeptical. A <em>Bloomberg</em> rumor from 2019 had Apple developing satellite technology for the iPhone, but the team reportedly hoped to ship a product within five years ‚Äî two years might be too early, assuming the leaks were accurate in the first place. There are also logistical questions to address, such as the choice of service providers. Satellite service has historically been expensive, and it might be a tough sell even if you regularly venture beyond cellular coverage.</p><p>Many expect Apple to launch the new iPhone lineup in September. It&#39;s not certain if this would be limited to Pro models or reach the entire iPhone range.</p><p>If there is a satellite linkup, though, Apple might have a stronger hook for the new iPhone than rumored display and camera upgrades. This would be the first mainstream smartphone offering connectivity virtually anywhere on the planet, and competitors might not match the feature for a while.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84f12ff9-556b-4494-8843-28ed436b3a9e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630256052</ingested><modified>2021-08-29T16:54:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite drops to all-time low price of $71 in one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now might be a good time to buy an e-reader for school ‚Äî or that end-of-summer vacation.

YouTube creator Austin Evans has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg">posted</a> a teardown that shows the revised PS5 Digital Edition (that is, the no-disc model) is using a smaller, likely lower-cost heatsink. While this shaves a whopping 0.66lbs off the weight, it also raises the overall temperature by a few degrees ‚Äî not necessarily a major issue, but worth noting if you either <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">upgrade your SSD</a> or stuff your system into a crowded media cabinet.</p><p>There are subtler changes as well, including an easier-to-use stand screw and tweaked connections to the WiFi chip, although it&#39;s not clear if or how the wireless changes make a practical difference. It&#39;s also uncertain how many of these changes translate to the disc drive version of the PS5.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company hasn&#39;t officially explained its design choices for the updated PS5. As Evans speculates, however, the refreshed PS5 may be a cost-cutting measure that reflects lessons learned in the several months since the machine&#39;s debut.

In its first-quarter earnings briefing, Sony <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-is-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss/">told investors</a> it was no longer selling the disc-based PS5 at a loss ‚Äî this latest design could make the Digital Edition profitable that much sooner.

Where the company typically asks for a 30 percent cut of Play Store purchases, it apparently determined that it could break even with just six percent.  Internal communications suggest Google chose the 30 percent share for no reason &quot;other than copying Apple,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Google for comment. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, a spokeswoman maintained that developers were bound to the same policies as &quot;all other developers,&quot; and that there were efforts to back app makers with &quot;enhanced resources and investments.&quot; These initiatives were evidence of &quot;healthy competition&quot; in operating systems and app stores, Google said.</p><p>If the allegations are true, though, that wouldn&#39;t be the case ‚Äî Google would have given Netflix a sweetheart deal not available to other Play Store developers. The company wouldn&#39;t be alone, either.

The hackers, known as Belarus Cyber Partisans, have been leaking information they found on sensitive police and government networks. They first started defacing government websites as an act of protest in September 2020 following the country&#39;s disputed election, in which Alexander Lukashenko&#39;s win was widely considered as fraudulent. But they also publish the information they get on Telegram, where they have 77,000 subscribers.</p><p>The group told the publications that it&#39;s made up of 15 IT and cybersecurity experts working in the country&#39;s tech sector. None of them are &quot;professional hackers,&quot; a spokesperson told <em>Tech Review</em>, with only four out of 15 doing the actual &quot;ethical hacking.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Partisans&#39; most recent attacks gave them access to drone footage from the government&#39;s crackdowns on protests last year and the Ministry of Interior Affairs&#39; mobile phone surveillance database. They also apparently got access to emergency services&#39; audio recordings, as well as video feeds from road speed and isolation cell surveillance cameras. The data the group released over the past weeks include lists of alleged police informants, personal information about top government officials and spies, police drone and detention center footage and secret recordings captured by the government&#39;s wiretapping system.</p><p>If the Cyber Partisans have been effective in their efforts to infiltrate the government&#39;s networks, it&#39;s thanks to the help they get from another group called BYPOL. They reportedly reached out to BYPOL in December 2020 for guidance ‚Äî after all, the group is made up of former Lukashenko officials who defected from the government and current ones working to topple the regime from the inside.&nbsp;</p><p>BYPOL provides them information on how to infiltrate government organizations and on the structure of the administration&#39;s databases. In return, the Cyber Partisans provide the group with information it can use to investigate the regime&#39;s crimes. BYPOL publishes information on its own Telegram channel and creates documentaries, one of which was cited at a congressional hearing that led to the US <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-europe-belarus-6adf187862771cb7869cd3bb777fd92a">imposing sanctions</a> against the Lukashenko regime.</p><p>The Cyber Partisan spokesperson told <em>Tech Review</em> that they&#39;re using cyberattacks to &quot;paralyze as much as possible of the regime&#39;s security forces, to sabotage the regime&#39;s weak points in the infrastructure and to provide protection for protesters.&quot; Their ultimate goal is &quot;to stop the violence and repression from the terroristic regime in Belarus and to bring the country back to democratic principles and rule of law.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/belarusian-hackers-overthrow-lukashenko-government-200457163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">694a0358-1d83-4d3d-a16f-fe6f9216103a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 20:04:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630180756</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T19:59:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unrest, Conflicts & War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c662ff00-f918-11eb-b6f7-f6733293a6f9" width="2344" height="1563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c662ff00-f918-11eb-b6f7-f6733293a6f9" width="2344" height="1563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PAVEL ORLOVSKY via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko looks on during a press conference in Minsk on August 9, 2021. - Belarus's strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko dismissed international criticism on August 9, 2021, a year after claiming to win a disputed election that led to unprecedented protests in the country.¬†In power since 1994, Lukashenko has been cracking down on opponents since the mass protests that erupted after the vote, deemed unfair by the West.¬† (Photo by Pavel ORLOVSKY / BELTA / AFP) (Photo by PAVEL ORLOVSKY/BELTA/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BELARUS-POLITICS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft might not deliver Windows 11 updates to PCs with old CPUs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft might let you install Windows 11 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">on PCs with older processors</a>, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll get the full experience you&#39;d find on newer machines.

To make that happen, Felix &amp; Paul Studios, one of the series&#39; creators, customized a virtual reality camera and attached it to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-27-dextre-canadarm2-robot-iss.html">Canadarm2</a> robot to capture 3D, 360-degree scenes from outside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-2-dragon-docks-with-iss-153112501.html">space station</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Felix &amp; Paul&#39;s &quot;Outer Space Camera&quot; is a customized version of the commercially available Z-Cam V1 Pro. It has nine 4K sensors that can take 3D, 360-degree images at 8K resolution. The camera has also been modified to withstand harsh conditions, including UV radiation, temperature extremes and micrometeoroid impacts. The team attached it to the Canadarm2 robotic arm, which moves around the station&#39;s external structure.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Jonathan Woods, the series&#39; executive producer for Time Studios (one of the entities behind the project, along with NASA), said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Capturing the Earth in stereoscopic 3D, 360-degree format from space, outside the space station, has never been attempted until now. It&#39;s beyond exciting and surreal to see this happening, knowing that the dream for this ambitious project started over five years ago in 2015.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Episodes 3 and 4 will be available this fall and winter, respectively, in 360-degree mobile format on 5G-enabled devices through leading carriers around the world, including LGU+ in South Korea, KDDI in Japan, Orange in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany.

Nida-e-Haqq, the group&#39;s media arm, posted messages on the website in the Urdu language, including ones celebrating the recent suicide bombing in Kabul that killed 170 people. Since Amazon&#39;s policy bars clients from using its services to incite violence and terror, the company pulled the website after <em>The Post</em> alerted it to its existence.&nbsp;</p><p>The website Amazon disabled provided content for the Nida-e-Haqq app, which recently showed an image of the Kabul bomber wrapped in a suicide vest.

As <em>The Post</em> said, Amazon may not be proactively policing its clients&#39; content, relying instead on the complaints it gets.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in January, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-suspends-parler-aws-access-025310355.html">suspended</a> Parler&#39;s AWS hosting services after it found multiple posts on the social network &quot;that clearly encourage and incite violence.&quot; Parler sued Amazon, claiming antitrust violations, but the company said it sent the website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-responds-parler-lawsuit-203419366.html">several warnings</a> about violent posts on its platform before the takedown. Ultimately, a judge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-can-keep-parler-servers-offline-judge-203604006.html">shot down</a> Parler&#39;s attempt to get AWS to restore its service, citing the dangers posed by &quot;inflammatory rhetoric&quot; found on the social network.</p><p><strong>Update 8/28 12PM ET:</strong> An AWS spokesperson stressed to Engadget that it was only the website running on AWS, not the app itself, and said company staff &quot;act quickly&quot; whenever there&#39;s a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The app referenced by the Washington Post is not running on AWS. However, following an investigation, we have disabled a website that was linked to this app as it was in violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy (AUP).

Part of that wide-ranging investigation will apparently involve a close look at the biggest social media companies in the world. The committee today <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-demands-records-related-january-6th-attack-social-media-0">announced</a> that it was requesting records relating to the attack from 15 companies, who were asked to respond in the next two weeks.</p><p>It&#39;s a who&#39;s who of the biggest players on the internet, including Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitch, Telegram and TikTok. On the list are a number of smaller, pro-Trump sites that have sprung up in recent years, including Gab and Parler, as well as known cesspools 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Specifically, the Select Committee wants records relating to the spread of misinformation, efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, efforts to prevent certification of the election, foreign influence attempt in the election, and domestic violent extremism. Additionally, the Committee is also looking for materials from these companies relating to any policy changes that were considered or adopted to address misinformation, violent extremism and foreign malicious influence.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the Committee wants to hear both about policy changes that were put into place as well as things that the companies &quot;failed to adopt.&quot; One example of a change that came about in response to the attack happened recently at Facebook, where the company adopted a recommendation from its Oversight Board. The company walked back its policy that allowed politicians to circumvent some of its rules under the guise of ‚Äúnewsworthiness,‚Äù though politicians still do get special treatment around other rules, like fact-checking.</p><p>It&#39;s been clear since the Select Committee came together that it was going to take the time to gather a huge amount of information to properly investigate the events of January 6th, and that extends to its requests to these companies. Now, the ball is in their respective courts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-select-committee-social-media-company-records-demand-211356022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a16e0a6c-a5d5-4b67-87c0-ec8b581001d7</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:13:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630105647</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T23:07:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-01%2F8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425&amp;compress=1&amp;progressive=1&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=200%2C300&amp;client=hawkeye&amp;signature=a972cd5c17df99a98f8fb102d705b2bbf5fefa72" width="200" height="131" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425" width="5004" height="3285" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[(FILES) Supporters of US President Donald Trump walk around in the Rotunda after breaching the US Capitol in Washington, DC, January 6, 2021. - The demonstrators breeched security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential election Electoral Vote Certification.

While the complaints point to alleged misconduct specific to each company, they broadly accuse DoorDash and GrubHub of employing a similar set of unfair business practices.</p><p>Specifically, the city claims that both DoorDash and GrubHub have consistently advertised delivery services from restaurants that never consented to a listing on their platforms. The city also alleges they employ &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; tactics by using deceptively small delivery fees to lure customers before hitting them with various other expenses at the end of a transaction. Finally, it says they both hide the fact many restaurants charge less for the items on their menu when you order directly from them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DoorDash called the lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and a &quot;waste&quot; of taxpayer money. &quot;DoorDash has stood with the City of Chicago throughout the pandemic, waiving fees for restaurants, providing $500,000 in direct grants, creating strong earning opportunities and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told Engadget.</p><p>GrubHub echoed the sentiments of its competitor. &quot;Every single allegation is categorically wrong, and we will aggressively defend our business practices,&quot; a GrubHub spokesperson said. &quot;We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail.&quot;</p><p>In taking the two companies to court, the city says it seeks to mandate greater transparency from DoorDash and GrubHub, as well as financial restitution for restaurants and consumers hurt by their alleged actions.</p><p>Separately, the DoorDash lawsuit alleges the company misled customers about how it was using tips to pay its delivery workers. If that sounds familiar, it&#39;s because DoorDash agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html">pay a $2.5 million settlement</a> toward the end of 2020 to settle allegations related to that exact same issue.</p><p>For Chicago, this is the latest effort by the city to impose additional regulations on food delivery apps. In May 2020, it implemented a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chicago-itemized-breakdown-delivery-apps-210224890.html">policy </a>that saw both DoorDash and GrubHub required to include an itemized breakdown that lists how much restaurants pay when you order from them using an app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chicago-sues-doordash-grubhub-210424254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c29ba824-a0d9-4deb-a56d-ecbffb741acb</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:04:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630098268</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T21:04:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, USA - FEBRUARY 18: A food delivery guy with bicycle is seen as snowfall blankets the Times Square in New York City, United States as massive snow storm hits the east coast on February 18, 2021.

The answer the company settled on was to hire a soft-spoken actor to do their best <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-jony-ive-legacy.html">Jony Ive</a> impersonation and wax poetic about the humble headphone jack.</p><div id="086c35a574054448b25254dbd31bddaf"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJZuSVl5wjM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It‚Äôs a usual approach, but one that highlights a feature that‚Äôs missing in most modern phones, and in a way that‚Äôs funny and memorable. ‚ÄúThe circle: perfect, simple. Some might say simply perfect,‚Äù the actor declares in the opening moments of the clip, reciting a script that perfectly apes the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/28/jony-ive-best-apple-videos/">overwrought writing</a> that Ive‚Äôs videos at Apple became known for in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-jony-ive-lovefrom.html">later years at the company</a>.

It was the first of its kind to make it to market, and despite a troubled debut and wobbly sophomore launch, the series is now on its third generation. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Z Fold 3" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> is all grown up and stronger than ever. It‚Äôs had time to learn from the mistakes of its youth, and Samsung has devoted a ton of research into fortifying the foldable‚Äôs screen, hinge and overall build. This year, it‚Äôs added support for the S Pen, as well as water resistance and more optimized software. The phone is also $200 cheaper, now starting at $1,800. But despite all its growth, the Fold 3 is still undergoing an identity crisis.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Just by looking at it, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see a difference between the Fold 3 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">its predecessor</a>. The two have basically the same dimensions, with this year‚Äôs model coming in a little thicker. But despite gaining 0.4mm when unfolded, the Fold 3 is actually 0.8mm thinner than the Fold 2 when closed. It appears Samsung might have been able to reduce the gap between the two halves of the screen when it refined its hinge mechanism.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, without a side-by-side comparison, you probably won‚Äôt notice this. You also might not realize that the Fold 3 is 10 grams (or 0.35 ounces) lighter than its older sibling, either. But it‚Äôs certainly heavier than most other smartphones. It‚Äôs about 45 grams (or 1.58 ounces) heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the S21 Ultra, and after prolonged use my arm started to feel the strain. Still, it‚Äôs basically two phones in one, which means the only device that might be fair to compare it to is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html#hardware">the Surface Duo</a>. Microsoft‚Äôs dual-screen phone is noticeably thinner and lighter than the Fold 3.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd350ea0-074f-11ec-bbdb-86107783ed85" alt="A closed Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 sitting on a window ledge with its triple cameras facing up." data-uuid="16eea1be-dc60-3674-898b-d9dfda9cd644"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel For Engadget</div></figure><p>Because it didn‚Äôt have a flexible display, though, the Surface Duo presented less of an engineering challenge. Durability is a greater concern with foldables like the Fold and Flip 3. Samsung said it used stronger aluminum in the Fold‚Äôs frame, streamlined its hinge and redesigned the screen‚Äôs layers to make the device sturdier. It also applied a new stretchable PET protector on the panel. Altogether the company said the Fold 3‚Äôs screen is 80 percent more durable than its predecessor.</p><p>That‚Äôs not something I can gauge without intentionally trying to damage the Fold 3. But its screen does feel more glass-like than the original, and the protector completely covers the display so you won‚Äôt see its edges that tempt you to peel it off. Some reviewers noted bubbles appearing on their Fold 2 after a few months, and since it hasn‚Äôt been that long, I can‚Äôt say for sure if the new model will do the same.</p><p>For now, though, the Fold 3 has withstood being tossed around in a purse full of sharp and heavy objects and still looks pristine. It also survived some droplets of water after I set it down near the sink when I was washing my hands, thanks to its new IPX8 water-resistance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/97009a60-0750-11ec-afbd-9b51e8231aa7" alt="The Thom Browne edition of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold half opened and with its back facing the camera." data-uuid="65ee5a57-e475-320d-a972-186bc82120d2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>When open, the Fold 3 is easy enough to hold with one hand, though I generally held it with both for easier typing. While I appreciate that the hinge is sturdy enough that you can leave the phone open at any angle, it makes unfolding the device kind of hard. The magnets that keep the device shut are very strong, so you‚Äôll have to first pry them apart and then push deliberately to extend it all the way. In fact, I had a few close calls where I almost dropped the Fold 3 when struggling to open it.</p><p>Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt, because any scratches would be quite obvious on my all-black review unit. The Fold 3 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold3-5g/buy/galaxy-z-fold3-5g-256gb-att-sm-f926uzkaatt/?cid=sem-mktg-pfs-mob-us-google-na-08092021-141317-&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE-cr:0-pl:307569818-&amp;ds_c=FF~Core_CN~galaxy+fold_PH~laun_MK~usnat_BS~im_PR~smart_SB~q2_PK~ROAS_FS~lo_CA~kew_KS~ba_MT~exact-&amp;ds_ag=AG~Core_MK~usnat_AT~ta_MD~h_PK~roah_PB~google_AI~no_TG~na_SA~mass-&amp;ds_k=galaxy+z+fold3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1JeJBhB9EiwAV612y8xBO6fYFo3DvH1muLbGKepLO7ITkeOn2MyMBGUcCtEofEXySB8uRxoCQMAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">also comes in silver, green</a> and a Thom Browne version with red, white and blue stripes. You‚Äôll have to spend $3,450 to get the latter in a limited-edition bundle, though.</p><h2>A tale of two displays</h2><p>Outside, the Fold 3 has a 6.2-inch 2,268 x 832 display, which now refreshes at 120Hz. It also uses a Dynamic AMOLED panel, which supports HDR10+ as opposed to last generation‚Äôs Super AMOLED. The faster screen makes scrolling my neverending inbox super smooth, and pictures on my Instagram feed look vibrant. Aside from these upgrades, the Fold 3‚Äôs external display is basically the same as its predecessor‚Äôs, which means it has a similarly narrow aspect ratio.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77e451c0-0751-11ec-b5e9-369516f4fa4e" alt="A hand holding up the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 with its screen open and facing the camera. A crease runs down the middle of the home page. " data-uuid="84a1700c-b81a-3eea-8092-e9f5098b067c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>While that makes the closed device easier to navigate with one hand, it also means most content feels cramped. Buttons on the keyboard, for example, are smaller and harder to aim for, while lengthy messages and tweets take up more lines so you‚Äôll see fewer on the page at once.</p><p>Thankfully, when you need more room, you can open up the Fold to use the 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel inside. Like the outside display, this has a 120Hz refresh rate, and it runs at 2,208 x 1,768. To give you a more immersive full-screen experience, Samsung used an under-display camera (UDC) here that can camouflage beneath pixels so you won‚Äôt have to see the little hole that most modern phones have for their selfie sensors.</p><p>I don‚Äôt know about you, but I never found those tiny circles to be very obstructive or much of an eyesore. Still, if you really hate seeing it, the good news is the UDC does disappear into the screen with the right background or app. The bad news is that you‚Äôll still see it on darker wallpapers, and even when the screen above the camera is displaying something, it creates a noticeable ring of pixelation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/96ac7f90-0753-11ec-973c-7e8159ad9573" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&#39;s under-display camera. You can make out grid of individual pixels above the sensor." data-uuid="5998bd0f-cc06-3ad4-8311-e83fa14b29b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This didn‚Äôt bother me much, and after some time I even forgot the camera was there. Most people likely won‚Äôt mind the little distortion the UDC causes. Regardless, the rest of the screen is bright, colorful and crisp, making it a pleasant canvas for my videos and casual games.</p><h2>S Pen and multitasking software</h2><p>The Fold 3‚Äôs internal display isn‚Äôt just great for Netflixing. With S Pen support this year, the foldable screen is more useful for those who want to write notes or sketch diagrams on that expansive surface. You‚Äôll have to pay an extra $50 for the S Pen Fold edition or $100 for the Pro model, which comes with a case. The Fold version doesn‚Äôt require charging and is pretty basic, while the Pro needs power for features like switching between other Samsung phones and Bluetooth controls. Either way, there isn‚Äôt a slot on the phone for the stylus, so you‚Äôll have to put up with carrying around a loose accessory.</p><p>If you‚Äôre willing to splurge, the S Pen is a generally helpful tool on the Fold 3. I mostly used it as a cursor to make navigating the larger screen easier, but it‚Äôs also fluid and responsive when doodling on Samsung Notes. The company also offers an ‚ÄúS Pen to text‚Äù setting that lets you more easily edit text by marking dittos, arrows or strokes directly on words. Drawing a line through letters, for example, will erase them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c0cb9450-0753-11ec-b7f7-13f6cb671238" alt="A person using the S Pen Pro to draw on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. They are holding the phone, half-folded, in their left hand with an S Pen Pro in their right. On the screen, they&#39;ve scrawled " data-uuid="8d27fcfc-7e66-34cc-b485-86177a218e5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>I‚Äôm not a fan of having to bring around any extra items to use a phone, but the S Pen did make it easier for me to write this review on the Fold 3 from the back of a cab. Trying to type on its larger screen with my fingers is a huge pain, and the stylus came in handy, making swipe typing more accurate. I also loved scribbling into search bars and messaging apps ‚Äî Samsung‚Äôs system is surprisingly adept at recognizing my awful handwriting.</p><p>While I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs worth the extra $50, I can appreciate the work Samsung had to do to make S Pen support a reality. As I dragged the nib around the screen during a bumpy ride, I managed not to damage the flexible display with any accidental pokes and stabs.</p><p>Even without the S Pen, the larger internal panel still offers a variety of useful multitasking features. Like its predecessors, the Fold 3 lets you place two apps side by side so you can keep an eye on Slack while writing a review or monitor Twitter for PlayStation 5 release news as you read articles on Chrome.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa7d2bf0-0753-11ec-affb-ecf091c7ca62" alt="Watching a video with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 half bent and sitting up on a window ledge like a mini laptop." data-uuid="22e6a5d1-071a-3f8e-b929-9ce49570e984"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This year, Samsung made it so you can pin the Edge panel to the screen so it acts like a desktop-style taskbar for easy access to your open and favorite apps. It‚Äôs a simple but tremendously useful update. Now, instead of having to swipe in to pull up the Edge panel and then drag an app out to open it in split-screen, the icons are already there. It does take up a column of space, though, which makes running two apps at once feel cramped. Thankfully, it&#39;s easy enough to hide with a tap.</p><p>It feels as if the floating panel has finally found its home on the Fold 3 since Samsung first launched it on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-09-samsung-galaxy-note-edge-review.html">the Galaxy Note Edge</a> in 2014. What used to be a somewhat awkward, only slightly convenient feature is now an actually useful tool that makes the Fold 3 feel like a more capable multitasking device.</p><p>Another thing Samsung did to improve the Fold‚Äôs big-screen experience is add the option to make all apps expand to fullscreen. Through its experimental Labs settings, the company lets you choose whether individual apps launch in 16:9, 4:3 or fullscreen. In the past, for example, Instagram would refuse to expand completely, resulting in an unsightly setup with the phone-sized app in the middle and blank space on either side. Now, you get to decide how much of the display they should take up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1c81aaf0-0754-11ec-bfaf-ba00583c2916" alt="Browsing Instagram on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-uuid="fd7bb263-570e-3cad-a499-764f51706be1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This only works partially, though. Yes, my feed does take up the whole screen, but watching and posting Stories still reverts to the phone-sized orientation. Also, a lot of pictures on Instagram look splotchy when the app is blown up. Samsung still has a ways to go, but I applaud the effort.</p><p>The company offers more features in Labs to improve the full-screen experience, including enabling Multi Window and Flex Mode panels for all apps. Like the aspect ratio tweak, these can be hit or miss. Flex Mode panel adds a mini dashboard to the bottom part of the screen when you half-open and set the Fold 3 up like a laptop. Some apps are optimized for this to offer useful, well-spaced controls in this space. But for the ones that aren‚Äôt, like Chrome, Samsung‚Äôs software slaps a tiny, inch-tall row of four buttons at the bottom for keyboard, screenshot, brightness and volume.</p><p>I could go on about the rest of Samsung‚Äôs software, like how the App Continuity feature doesn‚Äôt always keep content in the same place when you open the Fold up to see something on the bigger screen. But that would take forever. In general, it feels like Samsung is putting more and more effort into band-aid solutions when Google should really be working on optimizing Android for tablets.</p><section data-eng-breakout="59ff456964e54c248b38380a0444b21a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/392005d0-0754-11ec-b6fb-4fe2297ffc8c" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 standing on a desk with its triple camera system facing the camera."></section><h2>A plethora of cameras (including one under a display)</h2><p>Like a person trying to be too many things, the Fold 3 is an overachiever. And the fact that it has <em>five</em> cameras onboard almost feels excessive. There‚Äôs a 10-megapixel selfie camera, the UDC, which is just 4-megapixels sharp and a trio of 12-megapixel sensors on the rear, including regular, ultra wide and telephoto lenses.</p><p>Most of these cameras perform just as well as iPhone and Pixel flagships, delivering bright, colorful pictures in most situations. It did justice to rows of mouthwatering sushi, clearly rendering scallions and individual grains of rice.</p><p>My nighttime shots of the USS Intrepid on the Hudson River also came out sharp and bright, though Google still has the edge in low light. Pictures of trees and buildings taken with the Pixel 5‚Äôs Night Sight mode were clear enough that leaves were distinct, while the Fold 3‚Äôs photo of the same was muddy.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="85112f27-8afc-479c-8b5f-3a172359d3c9"/><p>That‚Äôs a small gripe, though. The Fold 3‚Äôs rear cameras are otherwise comparable to their conventionally shaped counterparts. The selfie sensor also delivered pleasantly crisp, vibrant photos.</p><p>My main complaint about photo or video quality would be with the UDC ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a small one. You can clearly tell when using this to take selfies or chat with friends that it‚Äôs a lower-quality option. Details are less sharp and colors aren‚Äôt as saturated. Still, I don‚Äôt expect much from a 4-megapixel camera, especially not one that‚Äôs under a screen. This feels more like a last resort if you really must take a call with the Fold open and is just serviceable.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>Whether I was using the outside screen or the internal panel, the Fold 3 was mostly snappy. Its Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB of RAM delivered smooth performance as I marked dozens of emails as read, wrote a review while watching a video and Slacking my colleagues. I occasionally had to wait for an app to re-open when I switched between the two displays, but for the most part everything flew.</p><p>I also never found myself worrying about the Fold 3 running out of juice. It generally stuck around for at least a day and a half, sometimes only conking out after two days. I ran our video rundown test on the Fold 3‚Äôs larger screen and it clocked 14 hours and 3 minutes. The Surface Duo only lasted 10 hours and 32 minutes in a similar setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7243b550-0754-11ec-9fca-3bf7ca5ab8c0" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 laying open, flat on its back, on a window ledge." data-uuid="e5202088-1b98-3058-86d9-fd11f48eae8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2><br>Wrap-up</h2><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Fold 3" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Fold 3</a>, it feels like Samsung has tried extremely hard to make a foldable smartphone-tablet hybrid work. But while I found myself eagerly reaching for the Flip 3 when I was reviewing it, I struggled to find reasons to use the Fold 3. When it‚Äôs closed, it‚Äôs heavier and narrower than a regular phone. I only want to open it up for gaming and getting work done on my commute. For the times when I‚Äôm leaning back on my couch and want to idle away on Reddit or Twitter, the Fold 3 doesn‚Äôt satisfy. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing, but I‚Äôm not here to debate the philosophical benefits of foldables.</p><p>I had a similar issue with the Surface Duo, which tried to be a tablet and a phone and failed at both. Though the Fold 3 is in most ways superior, it still won‚Äôt replace a regular smartphone. It‚Äôs a well-made, impressive piece of tech that has benefited from years of R&amp;D, but it suffers from an identity crisis by attempting to be two things at once. Does that mean the world should give up on foldable phones altogether? Absolutely not. As components get smaller, the Fold could one day be thin and light enough with much improved software that might make it useful in all its modes. But for now, despite all the progress Samsung has made, the Fold 3 is still not ready for the mainstream.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 or 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor (2.84Ghz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz)</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 12GB with 256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Main display</strong>: 7.6-inch 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED Infinity Flex Display</p><p><strong>Main display resolution</strong>: 2,208 x 1,768 (22.5:18)</p><p><strong>External display</strong>: 6.2-inch 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED</p><p><strong>External display resolution</strong>: 2,268 x 832 (24.5:9)</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera with OIS and 83-degree FOV, 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (123-degree FOV), 12MP f/2.4 telephoto camera with OIS and 45-degree FOV</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 10MP f/2.2 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Inside (under-display) camera</strong>: 4MP f/1.8 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with One UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 4,400mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C with fast wired charging at 25W (QC2.0 and AFC) and fast wireless charging at 10W (WPC and PMA).

A capability to generate hypotheses exhaustively and efficiently verify them is the core of the system.‚Äù</p><p>Today‚Äôs AIs are themselves the result of decades of scientific research and experimentation, starting back in 1950 when Alan Turing published his seminal treatsie, <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf"><em><ins>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</ins></em></a>. Over the years, these systems have grown from laboratory curios to vital data processing and analytical tools ‚Äî but Kitano wants to take them a step further, effectively creating ‚Äúa constellation of software and hardware modules dynamically interacting to accomplish tasks,‚Äù what he calls an ‚ÄúAI Scientist.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúInitially, it will be a set of useful tools that automate a part of the research process in both experiments and data analysis,‚Äù he told Engadget. ‚ÄúFor example, laboratory automation at the level of a closed-loop system rather than isolated automation is one of the first steps. A great example of this is <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017APS..MARX49001K/abstract"><ins>Robot Scientist Adam-Eve</ins></a> developed by Prof. Ross King that automatically generates hypotheses on budding yeast genetics, plan experiments to support or refute, and execute experiments.‚Äù</p><div id="2cb7bd7824344a97829b2df33c3b9fdb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQaKoM5YGXk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>‚ÄúGradually, the level of autonomy may increase to generate a broader range of hypotheses and verification,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúNevertheless, it will continue to be a tool or a companion for human scientists at least within the foreseeable future.‚Äù</p><p>By having an AI Scientist handle the heavy intellectual lifting involved in generating hypotheses to explore, their human counterparts would have more free time to focus on research strategies and decide which hypotheses to actually look into, Kitano explained.</p><p>As always, avoiding the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/6"><ins>Black Box Effect</ins></a> and implicit bias (both in the software‚Äôs design and the data sets it is trained on) will be of paramount importance to establishing and maintaining trust in the system ‚Äî the residents of Dr. Moreau‚Äôs island wouldn‚Äôt have been any less miserable had he been a mad AI instead of a mad geneticist.</p><p>‚ÄúFor scientific discoveries to be accepted in the scientific community, they must be accompanied with convincing evidence and reasoning behind them,‚Äù Kitano said. ‚ÄúAI Scientists will have components that can explain the mechanisms behind their discoveries. AI Scientists that do not have such explanation capabilities will be less preferred than ones [that do].‚Äù</p><p>Some of history&#39;s greatest scientific discoveries ‚Äî from radiation and the microwave to Teflon and the pacemaker ‚Äî have all come from experimental screwups. But <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/07/31/facebook-ai-creates-its-own-language-in-creepy-preview-of-our-potential-future/"><ins>when hyper-intelligent AIs start devising their own inscrutable spoken language</ins></a>, researchers rush to pull the plug. So what happens if and when an AI Scientist makes a discovery or <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-designs-quantum-physics-experiments-beyond-what-any-human-has-conceived/"><ins>devises an experiment</ins></a> that humans cannot immediately understand, even with an explanation?</p><p>‚ÄúWhen AI Scientists get sophisticated enough to handle complex phenomena, there are chances to discover things that are not immediately understood by human scientists,‚Äù Kitano admitted. ‚ÄúTheoretically, there is a possibility that someone can run highly autonomous AI Scientists without restrictions and [not caring] if their discovery is understandable. However, this may come with a large price tag and one has to justify it. When such an AI Scientist is recognized to make important scientific discoveries already, I am certain there will be guidelines for operation to ensure safety and to prevent misuse.‚Äù</p><p>The advent of an AI Scientist able to work alongside human researchers could also lead to some sticky questions as to who should be credited with the discoveries made ‚Äî is it the AI that generated the hypothesis and ran the experiment, the human that oversaw the effort, or the academic institution/corporate entity that owns the operation? Kitano points to a recent decision <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264"><ins>by an Australian court</ins></a> that recognized <a href="https://artificialinventor.com/dabus/"><ins>the DABUS ‚Äúartificial neural system‚Äù</ins></a> as an inventor for patent applications as one example.</p><p>Conversely, Kitano notes the case of Satoshi Nakamoto and his inventions of blockchain and bitcoin. ‚ÄúThere is a case where a decisive contribution was simply published as a blogpost and taken seriously,‚Äù he argues, ‚Äúyet no one ever met him and his identity (at the time of writing) is a complete mystery.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIf a developer of an AI Scientist was determined to create a virtual persona of a scientist with an <a href="https://orcid.org/"><ins>ORCID iD</ins></a>, for demonstration of technological achievement, product promotion, or for another motivation,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúiit would be almost impossible to distinguish between the AI and human scientist.‚Äù But if a truly groundbreaking medical advancement comes from this challenge ‚Äî say, a cure for cancer or nanobot surgeons ‚Äî does it really matter if it was a human or a machine running the experiment?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonys-head-of-ai-research-wants-to-build-robots-that-can-win-a-nobel-prize-180059012.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0cbcd62a-0908-4ae5-91c1-be8c594edd4b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630083673</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T17:01:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a808000-0756-11ec-a3ff-b61c862ec370" width="8114" height="5088" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a808000-0756-11ec-a3ff-b61c862ec370" width="8114" height="5088" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[metamorworks via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Medical technology concept.

It quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">reversed course</a>, saying that more people could install the software update than its requirements originally stated so the company could gather more performance on how the OS performed. After a few months of users testing and providing feedback, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/">Microsoft says that</a>, for the most part, its system requirements from June will stand ‚Äî but there are a few notable changes.</p><p>This means that you&#39;ll need a compatible 64-bit processor, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage, as well as &quot;UEFI secure boot, graphics requirements and TPM 2.0.&quot; For the most part, Microsoft is still requiring an 8th-generation or newer Intel processor, but the company is adding a few 7th-generation Intel options to the supported list, including Intel Core X-series, Xeon W-series and the Intel Core 7820HQ. For the latter, Microsoft will only support &quot;select devices that shipped with modern drivers based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/dch-principles-best-practices#dch-design-principles">Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps (DCH) </a>design principles, including Surface Studio 2.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After working with AMD, Microsoft has declined to include the first generation of AMD Zen processors in its officially supported list. The full list of supported processors can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements">here</a>.</p><p>There is some good news for people running older hardware, though. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes">According to <em>The Verge</em></a>, Microsoft won&#39;t prohibit computers running processors on its &quot;supported&quot; list from installing Windows 11 ‚Äî they just won&#39;t be able to do so through the official Windows update software. You&#39;ll instead have to download a Windows 11 ISO file and install it yourself. <em>The Verge</em> says this method will primarily be for businesses to try Windows 11 and it won&#39;t be publicizing this method to standard users.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re still wondering whether or not your computer will be able to officially run Windows 11, Microsoft has released an update for its PC Health Check, which was originally giving users some rather vague and unhelpful messages regarding compatibility. The new version should make it much clearer whether your computer is supported and, if not, what it needs to meet the Windows 11 system requirements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb35254b-1e7e-42f9-855d-60ca218a7978</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 17:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630086946</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T17:55:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bafe48f0-075e-11ec-b37f-1e7e0f652653" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bafe48f0-075e-11ec-b37f-1e7e0f652653" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft releases an improved Windows 11 PC health check app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Workers say they've collected almost 500 toxic workplace stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-workers-201202748.html">sending out a call to action</a> on Monday, #AppleToo, a group made up of current and former Apple workers looking to shine a light on the company‚Äôs workplace culture, says it has collected nearly 500 stories of incidents involving discrimination, harassment and retaliation ‚Äúthat happened at the hands of a colleague off of campus.‚Äù According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers/status/1431274019878158339?s=20">Apple Workers Twitter account</a>, the majority of those who got in touch asked for information on how to file a complaint with an external authority like the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).</p><div id="69be1e8ca7884e8bb830ad5f57658665"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So far, we&#39;ve received nearly 500 responses, and hundreds of stories of racism, sexism, discrimination, retaliation, bullying, sexual and other forms of harassment, and sexual assault that happened at the hands of a colleague off of campus. <br><br>The main thread?
