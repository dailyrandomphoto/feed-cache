However, the company&#39;s 2020 models didn&#39;t offer active noise cancellation (ANC) and only the pricier Sport version had wireless charging. Today, Klipsch is making both of those standard features with <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-earphones">the T5 II ANC</a>, plus it&#39;s throwing in AI-powered features from true wireless pioneer Bragi and Dirac HD Sound. All of the additions make this model a true flagship, right down to the premium price of $299.&nbsp;</p><p>The T5 II ANC has the same design for both the earbuds and the case as the T5 II. The buds were retooled after the original T5 to make them more comfortable. Klipsch still includes six sets of oval silicon ear tips to help you find the best fit, but the T5 II ANC is only IPX4 rated water resistant (compared to the T5 II&#39;s IP67). Inside, the company uses a redesigned 5.8mm driver with a thinner diaphragm that it says improves sound quality across all frequencies.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Klipsch takes the audio profile a step further with some help from Dirac&#39;s HD Sound technology. Dirac is known for its &quot;digital audio optimization,&quot; and in 2020 the company announced plans to both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-dirac-headphone-audio-correction-dsp.html">recalibrate your headphones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dirac-spatial-audio-headphone-bluetooth-chips-130017379.html">integrate its sound tech directly inside future products</a>. For the T5 II ANC, Klipsch says HD Sound will improve staging, clarity, voice and bass while still allowing you to apply custom EQ settings at you see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key element of the T5 II ANC are the hands-free gestures called Bragi Moves. Bragi was one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-20-bragi-dash-review.html">first companies to build true wireless earbuds</a>, long before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-apple-airpods-best-selling-true-wireless-earbuds.html">Apple helped popularize</a> the product category. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-16-bragis-dash-pro-earbuds-ai.html">Dash line of earbuds</a> not only worked better than many of the early options, but they were also packed with more tech: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-02-bragi-dash-update-kinetic-siri-wireless-earbuds.html">gesture controls</a>, on-board music storage, fitness tracking, real-time translation and more. In 2019, Bragi announced that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-bragi-sells-off-hardware-business.html">sold its hardware business to focus on software and AI</a>. Klipsch is one of the first to integrate the company&#39;s gesture controls, including the ability to answer calls by nodding or to skip tracks by shaking your head. Bragi&#39;s tech will also enable Sidekicks or automated processes like turning on ANC when you listen to music or activating transparency mode when you get a call. Klipsch and Bragi said more features will be available in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4cbde4c0-f33d-11eb-9a7f-a6b8cd3d5e4a" alt="Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition" data-uuid="401a11af-e932-3b73-a067-2ac248c466ec"><figcaption>Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Klipsch</div></figure><p>The noise-cancelling setup on the T5 II ANC employs dual microphones on each earbud (feedforward and feedback) to catch as much external distraction as possible. Like the T5, this model also includes a transparency mode so you can tune into your surroundings when needed. Klipsch promises &quot;loud and clear&quot; calls as well, with six beamforming microphones and automatic noise suppression.&nbsp;</p><p>All of those new features led to less battery life. With ANC on, Klipsch says you can muster five hours of listening on the buds themselves. That&#39;s down from eight on the T5 II and T5 II Sport. When you disable the noise-cancelling feature, the company says you can expect two more hours of use. The included case holds 21 additional hours (three full charges) and Qi-compatible wireless charging is on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did with the T5 II Sport, Klipsch is offering <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-mclaren-edition-earphones">a McLaren Edition</a> of the T5 II ANC. The company is a sponsor for McLaren&#39;s Formula 1 team, so it&#39;s bringing papaya orange, carbon fiber and a tire tread pattern from the track to your earbuds. This special version carries all of the same features of the regular T5 II ANC, but it comes with a wireless charging pad and it&#39;s equipped with NuCurrent charging tech. Klipsch says this feature combined with the McLaren Edition case &quot;will charge twice as fast as anything else on the market.&quot; Racing fans will have to pony up an extra $50 though: the special edition is $349.&nbsp;</p><p>Both <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-earphones">the T5 II ANC</a> and <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-mclaren-edition-earphones">T5 II ANC McLaren Edition</a> are available starting today.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c59dac8c-0b51-4c2c-bf01-2c92198f2aba"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/klipsch-t5-ii-anc-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-130001664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cbe4bb2d-13db-4595-9494-9dc922f3dbe8</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627907060</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T12:24:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01041150-f327-11eb-9f3e-6dbb2b1e6ec8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01041150-f327-11eb-9f3e-6dbb2b1e6ec8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klipsch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 512GB M1 Mac Mini falls back to $799 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been eyeing Apple&#39;s latest Mac Mini as your next desktop, now is the time to act. You can currently get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">512GB model</a> for $799 at Amazon, or $100 off the normal $899 price. The deal brings the desktop down to just below the record low we saw in March and April. It also means you&#39;re only paying $100 more for double the storage of the $699 base model.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That should come in handy if you plan to take full advantage of the Mac Mini&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">M1 chip</a>. As we&#39;ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">previously</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">noted</a>, Apple&#39;s in-house silicon is a powerhouse that makes quick work of most tasks, be it browsing bloated websites or opening creative editing software. Inside the desktop, you&#39;ll find an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores and a 16-core Neural Engine. Unlike with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">iMac</a>, you&#39;ll also need your own display and peripherals like a keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few caveats, however. The Mac Mini&#39;s RAM and storage aren&#39;t upgradeable and the two rear Thunderbolt ports won&#39;t please those who need extra monitors and faster connectivity. Apple also offers 16GB unified memory, up to 2TB SSD storage and 10 Gigabit Ethernet support at a cost. In fact, the true top-of-the line Mac Mini will set you back $1,799. Saying that, the specs available on this deal model should please most casual users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-deal-123413396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47481a7f-ad42-4da6-ae91-e4a3c9650059</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:34:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627907657</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T12:34:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube trials a cheaper 'Premium Lite' subscription that only removes ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to boost YouTube Premium sign-ups, Google has offered everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-mini-youtube-premium-giveaway-143245422.html">free hardware</a> to access to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tubes-experimental-features-now-require-a-paid-premium-account-092633439.html">unique features</a>. Now, it&#39;s going back to basics. The company is testing a lower-priced subscription plan in parts of Europe that gives you ad-free viewing without offline downloads, YouTube Music and background playback. A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-sub-is-a-thing-now-in-select-countries.465198/">Resetera user</a> first spotted the new YouTube Premium Lite tier in Netherlands, Finland and Sweden while trying to cancel the paid-for service.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan costs €6.99 ($8.32) per month, the same as the student tier, whereas the normal price is €11.99 ($14.26).

Comparatively, Netflix Basic costs €7.99 ($9.50) in several of those regions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The YouTube Premium Lite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premiumlite">page</a> states that you get ad-free YouTube and YouTube Kids across multiple devices including mobile, desktop and TVs. In the past, YouTube has announced incentives for paying users including free products such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-free-stadia-chromecast-controller-180316212.html">Google Stadia</a> and neat features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-youtube-automatic-downloads-premium-subscribers.html">automatic downloads</a>.</p><p>But, since its launch, and subsequent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-17-youtube-premium-red-price.html">rebranding</a>, the service has always been more like a bundle with the inclusion of YouTube Music, which may not entice those already paying for Spotify or Apple Music.

Subscribers would receive a refund of either 15 percent or $25, whichever was larger, while everyone else would receive as much as $15. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-privacy-lawsuit-settlement-205427084.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>But wait, there’s more...</h2><h2></h2><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/moon-rover-vehicle-50th-anniversary-211405429.html"><ins>People first drove on the Moon 50 years ago today</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-the-semi-ev-debut-until-2022-citing-global-chip-shortages-160016735.html"><ins>Why Tesla is delaying the Semi EV until 2022</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/two-red-objects-asteroid-belt-115517310.html"><ins>Two red objects between Mars and Jupiter may explain how the solar system formed</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/doctor-who-chibnall-whittaker-departure-reformat-series-113012792.html"><ins>&#39;Doctor Who&#39; is overdue another revolution</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-now-offering-a-permanent-chromecast-and-stadia-controller-bundle-053733986.html"><ins>Google is now offering a permanent Chromecast and Stadia bundle</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-ikea-hid-an-air-purifier-inside-its-newest-table-111507895.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11eee847-1aec-4107-8db4-b2811926632a</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 11:15:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627898600</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T10:03:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3b45f1d0-ef94-11eb-bff6-be6e9a568d22" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3b45f1d0-ef94-11eb-bff6-be6e9a568d22" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IKEA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IKEA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IKEA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WH-1000XM4 ANC headphones fall back to $278 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed the all-time low deal for Sony&#39;s excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:WH-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/3jfAIwj">WH-1000XM4</a> ANC headphones, you&#39;re in luck.

At the same time, the headphones do a great job of blocking out background commotion. Sony also updated its audio-upscaling tech, known as the Digital Sound Enhancement Engine (DSEE), by adding Edge-AI that analyzes music in real time.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, it bolstered the companion app — which already offered plenty of audio customization — with the addition of multi-device connectivity.

If you prefer a hard connection, you can also get the Chromecast ethernet adapter for $10 more, for an additional $10 off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re okay with older hardware, Google is also offering the older Chromecast Ultra in a <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US">bundle</a> with the Stadia Controller for $80. The Chromecast Ultra is no longer sold by itself, so this is likely going to be a limited-time offer.&nbsp;</p><p>With the addition of a remote, Chromecast with Google TV went from being an also-ran streaming device to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">one of the best</a> out there. It&#39;s far easier to navigate than before thanks to the new Google TV interface and works with Google Assistant for voice control. The Stadia Controller, meanwhile, works seamlessly with Chromecast and Google-powered TVs and runs over WiFi, allowing for minimal latency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-is-now-offering-a-permanent-chromecast-and-stadia-controller-bundle-053733986.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92463add-a1ce-4cfc-abd0-bb29fd9399ed</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 05:37:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627882654</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T05:37:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bc5938c0-f34c-11eb-bbe4-b1e565948a20" width="1640" height="869" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bc5938c0-f34c-11eb-bbe4-b1e565948a20" width="1640" height="869" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google now offers a permanent Chromecast and Stadia controller bundle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google now offers a permanent Chromecast and Stadia controller bundle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next 'Fortnite' concert stars Ariana Grande]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic Games is continuing its string of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-j-balvin-halloween-concert-080036803.html">superstar <em>Fortnite</em> concerts</a>. The game developer has revealed a &quot;Rift Tour&quot; concert series that will star none other than pop songstress Ariana Grande. The first show takes place August 6th at 6PM Eastern, with subsequent shows on August 7th and 8th to ensure people in other time zones can tune in.</p><p>The game developer is warning concertgoers to arrive early (an hour before the show). The Rift Tour playlist will go live 30 minutes beforehand. It won&#39;t surprise you to hear that there will be themed cosmetic items, either. You can pick up an Ariana outfit to play as the pop star, and Piggy Smallz Back Bling adds a cute touch while you take down your battle royale rivals.

Multiple Sky videos reportedly violated rules denying the existence of the new coronavirus or claiming that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were effective treatments.</p><p>The clips didn&#39;t provide &quot;sufficient countervailing context&quot; to indicate the claims were false, YouTube told <em>The Guardian</em>. YouTube warned there was the potential for &quot;real-world harm&quot; from these videos. This just one &quot;strike&quot; against Sky — two more would lead to a permanent channel ban.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sky said it found older videos that broke YouTube&#39;s rules, but rejected claims that any of its hosts denied COVID-19&#39;s existence. The broadcaster&#39;s digital editor alleged that YouTube was threatening free thought, although YouTube is notably focusing on demonstrable facts, not opinions.</p><p>The TV network has come under fire for its stance on COVID-19, particularly from host Alan Jones. He falsely claimed the SARS-CoV-2 virus was &quot;not a pandemic&quot; in 2020, and in July incorrectly maintained that the virus&#39; Delta variant was neither dangerous nor affected by vaccines. An uproar over those last statements prompted Sky to make a formal apology on July 19th, removing the relevant video at the same time.</p><p>The suspension won&#39;t dramatically damage Sky&#39;s Australian revenue. It&#39;s still rare for YouTube to take that kind of action against a major media network, though. The move also sends a signal — large outlets can&#39;t count on their size to shield them against YouTube crackdowns.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3333b100-94c4-4f83-a01f-550665d4d898</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 21:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627853892</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T21:38:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - JUNE 4: Detail of the YouTube logo outside the YouTube Space studios in London, taken on June 4, 2019.

The preliminary settlement also requires tougher security measures, such as warning about participants with third-party apps and offering special privacy-oriented training to Zoom staff.</p><p>Judge Lucy Koh said the company was largely protected against zoombombing claims thanks to the Communications Decency Act&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">Section 230</a> safeguards against liability for users&#39; actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The settlement could also lead to payouts if the lawsuit achieves a proposed class action status, but don&#39;t expect a windfall. Subscribers would receive a refund of either 15 percent or $25, whichever was larger, while everyone else would receive as much as $15. Lawyers intended to collect up to $21.25 million in legal costs.</p><p>In a statement, Zoom denied doing anything wrong and said that privacy and security were &quot;top priorities.&quot; The company previously agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint over similar privacy issues, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-zoom-will-remove-server-behind-mac-security-hole.html">permanent web server</a> it installed on Macs.</p><p>Zoom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-zoom-user-trust-privacy-security-review.html">scrambled to bolster security</a> for its video chats after a surge in pandemic-related use drew attention to vulnerabilities in its software and services.  It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-rollout-183517995.html">rolling out end-to-end encryption</a> in October 2020, conducted reviews and made zoombombing more difficult. The improvements were too late for some users, though, and it&#39;s safe to say the settlement is a warning to companies that only belatedly tighten security for their apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-privacy-lawsuit-settlement-205427084.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74704347-bab2-49ec-9346-98e0b92ab979</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 20:54:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627851269</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T20:54:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/8be9e820-752a-11ea-afaf-5646d1c19067" width="5194" height="3523" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/8be9e820-752a-11ea-afaf-5646d1c19067" width="5194" height="3523" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Albert Gea / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A student takes online classes at home, with his companions, using the Zoom APP during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in El Masnou, north of Barcelona, Spain April 2, 2020.

However, it does mark a rare instance of Google cutting off basic functionality for older Android versions, not just OS updates or Play Services features.

As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters"><em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em></a> Mark Gurman and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/01/apple-watch-series-6-titanium-unavailable/"><em>Mac Rumors</em></a> note, the titanium Apple Watch is largely unavailable through the company&#39;s online stores in the US and other countries, whether you try for delivery or pick-up. This applies regardless of your case or strap choices.</p><p>Gurman speculated in his &quot;Power On&quot; newsletter that Apple underestimated demand. It likely made a small number of titanium Apple Watches and stopped production &quot;months ago&quot; in anticipation of switching focus to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Series 7</a>, according to Gurman, but ran out prematurely as sales remained relatively strong.

The tech giant has frequently shaken up its Watch Edition strategy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-07-apple-killed-off-its-super-expensive-gold-edition-watches.html">ditching its solid gold originals</a> in favor of more affordable ceramic and, eventually, titanium. It might decide that the costs of manufacturing upscale watches doesn&#39;t justify the comparatively meager sales. There&#39;s always the Hermès models if you want to splurge. At the same time, though, titanium versions don&#39;t cost that much more in practice — and they might serve as halo watches that attract conventional watch enthusiasts as well as the wealthy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-edition-titanium-unavailable-152716696.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea95d0cd-7e81-4496-8f1d-7a6bbae80495</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:27:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627831638</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T15:27:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Over 100 warship locations have been faked in one year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/police-get-google-location-data-george-floyd-protests-183114536.html">Abuses of location technology</a> might just result in hot political disputes. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fake-warships-ais-signals-russia-crimea/">According</a> to <em>Wired, </em>SkyWatch and Global Fishing Watch have <a href="https://skytruth.org/2021/07/systematic-data-analysis-reveals-false-vessel-tracks/">conducted</a> studies showing that over 100 warship locations have been faked since August 2020, including the British aircraft carrier <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> and the US destroyer <em>Roosevelt</em>. In some cases, the false data showed the vessels entering disputed waters or nearing other countries&#39; naval bases — movements that could spark international incidents.</p><p>The research team found the fakes by comparing uses of the automatic identification system (AIS, a GPS-based system to help prevent collisions) with verifiable position data by using an identifying pattern. All of the false info came from shore-based AIS receivers while satellites showed the real positions, for instance. Global Fishing Watch had been investigating fake AIS positions for years, but this was the first time it had seen falsified data for real ships.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain who&#39;s faking locations and why. However, analysts said the data was characteristic of a common perpetrator that might be Russia. Almost all of the affected warships were from European countries or NATO members, and the data included bogus incursions around Kaliningrad, the Black Sea, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-apple-to-review-disputed-borders-in-maps.html">Crimea</a> and other Russian interests. In theory, Russia could portray Europe and NATO as aggressors by falsely claiming those rivals sent warships into Russian seas.</p><p>Russia has historically denied hacking claims.

And if Russia is connected, the faked warship locations might be a significant escalation of that strategy. Even though such an approach might not lead to shooting matches, it could get disconcertingly close.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warship-fake-locations-221800228.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99a37a83-edd4-47d8-8fc4-88cdbf618195</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627906495</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T12:15:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Murad Sezer / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. Navy Arleigh-Burke class destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80) sets sail in the Bosphorus, returning from the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey October 2, 2020.

The <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/science/lunar-rover-apollo-nasa.html">noted</a> that July 31st, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1421173756458831875">marks</a> the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-across-the-airless-wilds-earl-smith-custom-house-153003777.html">Lunar Roving Vehicle&#39;s</a> first outing — and the first time people drove on the Moon. Apollo 15 astronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin took the car on a stint to collect samples and explore the lunar surface more effectively than they could on foot.</p><p>Scott and Irwin would eventually drive the rover two more times (for a total of three hours) before returning to Earth. The Apollo 16 and 17 missions each had an LRV of their own. There was also a fourth rover, but it was used for spare parts after the cancellation of Apollo 18 and further missions. All three serving models remained on the Moon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early development was problematic, in no small part due to the lack of real-world testing conditions. They couldn&#39;t exactly conduct a real-world test drive, after all. The team eventually settled on a collapsible design with steel mesh wheels that could safely handle the Moon&#39;s low gravity, lack of atmosphere, extreme temperatures and soft soil.</p><p>The LRV was modest, with a 57-mile range, four 0.19kW motors and an official top speed of 8MPH. It was also expensive, with cost overruns bringing the price of four rovers to $38 million (about $249 million in 2021 dollars). It was key to improved scientific exploration during the later stages of the Apollo program, though, and it was also an early example of a practical electric vehicle — humans were using a battery-powered ride on the Moon decades before the technology became mainstream on Earth.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on humans driving on the Moon any time soon, although that reflects the progress made in the 50 years since. NASA and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-china-yutu2-discovered-moon-mantle-material.html">other space agencies</a> are now focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-astrobotic-lunar-cube-rover-165307453.html">robotic rovers</a> that can explore the Moon without worries about crew safety. Those humans that do go on rides will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-gm-lockheed-martin-artemis-vehicle-131521711.html">likely use autonomous vehicles</a>.

While Unjected bills itself as a place to find others who support &quot;medical autonomy and free speech,&quot; social posts on the site have included false claims that vaccines modify genes, connect to 5G and serve as &quot;bioweapons.&quot;</p><p>The app founders are also embroiled in a fight over their Android app. Google told Unjected on July 16th that it had two weeks to remove the misleading posts from its app to avoid a Play Store ban. The developers responded by pulling the social feed. However, co-creator Shelby Thompson said Unjected planned to defy the request by restoring both the feed and the offending posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple and Google for comment. Unjected still has a presence on Instagram despite that social network&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rfk-jr-kicked-off-instagram-171539088.html">anti-misinformation stance</a>, although that account mostly promotes its views on &quot;freedom&quot; and only occasionally mentions falsehoods, such as incorrect claims that mRNA vaccines alter DNA. We&#39;ve asked Facebook for a response as well.</p><p>Unjected is small compared to mainstream social networks, with roughly 18,000 app downloads (according to Apptopia). However, the crackdown clearly serves as a warning — Apple and Google won&#39;t tolerate apps that knowingly accept and encourage the creation anti-vax content, even if they aren&#39;t directly producing that material.</p><p><strong>Update 7/31 6:18PM ET:</strong> Apple told Engadget that Unjected violated rules demanding reliable COVID-19 information from trustworthy sources, like health agencies and medical institutions. The tech firm further accused Unjected of less-than-honest tactics.

From the afternoon in December 1966 that he first tried out the Manned Maneuvering Unit in a Martin Marietta simulator, he was hooked on a vision of a gas-propelled jetpack that would allow astronauts to operate outside their spacecraft. This vision had an obvious pop-culture antecedent. In the 1920s a comic-strip character named Buck Rogers — a rock-jawed, All-American World War I veteran — succumbed to the effects of a mysterious gas he encountered while working as a mine inspector. He fell into a deep sleep and woke after five centuries of slumber to a strange new world of spaceships, ray guns, and Asian over-lords. Though he initially traveled this new world via an antigravity belt, a device that allowed him and his best gal, Wilma, to leap great distances at a time, Buck eventually acquired a svelte and evidently omnidirectional jetpack. He eventually ventured into space in an adventure called <em>Tiger Men from Mars</em>, and his exploits in the cosmos changed America’s vision of the future forever. Millions followed Buck’s adventures in the funnies, on radio, and in movie serials. Among Buck’s imitators and spiritual heirs are Flash Gordon, Brick Bradford, John Carter of Mars, and Han Solo.</p><p>A host of talented men and women spent significant amounts of time and money to wrestle that jetpack out of the funny papers and into the space shuttle. None worked harder, though, than Bruce McCandless and his chief collaborator, an Auburn-educated engineer and Air Force officer named Charles Edward (“Ed”) Whitsett, Jr. Whitsett was a pale, bespectacled individual, mild-mannered but tenacious. He had a head start on my father. He’d been thinking and writing about jetpack technology as early as 1962. In a sense, he was trying to solve a problem that didn’t exist yet: Namely, how could an astronaut venture outside his or her spaceship and perform constructive tasks in an environment with no oxygen, with extreme temperature fluctuations, and in an orbital “free fall” that would leave the spacefarer lolling in the practical equivalent of zero gravity? Alexei Leonov of the Soviet Union and American Ed White had proven that extravehicular activity was possible, that men could survive outside of their space capsule, but basically all they’d done was float. How could a man move from one part of a spaceship to another, or from one spacecraft to another craft, or from a spacecraft to a satellite, in order to make inspections or repairs? None of these needs really existed in the early sixties, when the programs of both nations were still just trying to fire tin cans into low Earth orbit and predict, more or less, where they would come back down. But clearly the needs would eventually arise, and various methods were proposed to address them.</p><p>In the mid-sixties, the Air Force assigned Whitsett to NASA to supervise development of the Air Force’s Astronaut Maneuvering Unit. Gene Cernan’s failed test flight of the AMU on Gemini 9 in 1966 — the “space-walk from hell,” as Cernan called it — set the jetpack project back, but it never went away. McCandless, Whitsett, and a NASA engineer named Dave Schultz worked quietly but assiduously to keep the dream alive. They enlarged and improved the AMU all through the latter half of the decade and into the seventies. In the “Forgotten Astronauts” wire story that portrayed him as a washout in 1973, my dad mentioned the reason why he wanted to stay in the manned space program despite not having won a crew assignment on either Apollo or Skylab. “McCandless,” said the article, “has helped develop the M509 experimental maneuvering unit. The Skylab astronauts strap it on like a backpack and propel themselves Buck Rogers — like around the Skylab interior. [He] wants to build a larger operational unit to perform space chores outside the shuttle.” And that’s exactly what he did.</p><p>Though the Skylab M509 tests in 1973 and 1974 were a resounding success, resulting in the triumph of the jetpack concept over both rocket boots and the handheld maneuvering unit, Whitsett and McCandless didn’t rest on their laurels. Over the next several years, using whatever time and funding they could scrape together, the team made multiple upgrades — eleven, by one count — to what was now being called the “manned maneuvering unit,” or MMU. The bulbous nitrogen-gas fuel tank of the ASMU was replaced with two streamlined aluminum tanks in the rear of the unit, each of which was wrapped in Kevlar. The number of propulsion nozzles was increased from fourteen to twenty-four, positioned around the jetpack to allow for six-degrees-of-freedom precision maneuvering. Smaller gyroscopes replaced those used on the ASMU, and, as space historian Andrew Chaikin has noted, the ASMU’s “pistol-grip hand controllers, which were tiring to operate in pressurized space suit gloves, were replaced by small T-handles that needed just a nudge of the fingertips.” The MMU’s new arm units were made to be adjustable, to accommodate astronauts of all sizes. Painted white for maximum reflectivity, the unit was built to survive the 500-degree fluctuation in temperatures (from a high of 250 degrees F to a low of minus 250 F!) that an astronaut might encounter in space.</p><p>By 1980 the machine weighed in at 326 pounds. Like the AMU and the ASMU before it, the MMU was designed to fit with or “over” the astronaut’s pressure suit. Shuttle astronauts wore a newly designed suit called the Extravehicular Maneuvering Unit, or EMU, a two-piece marvel of textile engineering made up of fourteen layers of Nylon ripstop, Gore-Tex, Kevlar, Mylar, and other substances. Power for the jetpack’s electronics was supplied by two 16.8-volt silver-zinc batteries. Two motion-control handles — the translational hand controller and the rotational hand controller — were mounted on the unit’s left and right armrests, respectively, and a button activated an “attitude-hold mode,” which used motion-sensing gyroscopes to direct the firing of the thrusters to maintain an astronaut’s position in space.</p><p>The machine had been tested in every way its designers could imagine. A representative of a local gun club visited Martin Marietta and shot the MMU’s nitrogen fuel tank with a .50 caliber bullet to ascertain whether the tank would explode if pierced. (It didn&#39;t.) The jetpack was run through hundreds of hours of simulations. At my father’s urging, a gifted and intense Martin Marietta project manager named Bill Bollendonk subjected the device to space-like conditions in the company’s thermal vacuum facility. The MMU was no longer a “far out” experiment, as Mike Collins once called it. It was now a promising space tool. Unfortunately, for the moment, it was still an unused space tool. American astronauts remained on Earth, as NASA struggled to produce its next-generation orbital workhorse, the space shuttle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-wonders-all-around-bruce-mc-candless-iii-green-leaf-book-group-153027314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49668cb9-798a-46b4-8cca-bf5dde2026d5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627578020</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T17:00:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2bb5450-efea-11eb-bfff-89891a0602ee" width="1600" height="901" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92f1e6b0-efe8-11eb-acfd-bd2e5c0bdf03" width="1366" height="768" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telegram's video calls can now accommodate up to 1,000 viewers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Telegram has <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000">expanded</a> the group video calling feature it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-group-video-calls-mobile-desktop-tablet-150020126.html">launched</a> in June to be able to accommodate more participants — a <em>lot</em> more.

On Friday, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=gaolegal">watchdog said</a> NASA’s “evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement’s terms.”</p><p>When Blue Origin first challenged the lunar lander contract in April, the company claimed the selection process was “fundamentally unfair” because it didn’t get a chance to revise its bid. To that point, NASA could afford to give SpaceX the contract because the company agreed to modify its payment schedule. Blue Origin also took issue with the fact that the space agency selected a single contractor for the project when the initial announcement had called for two manufacturers to be involved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In reviewing NASA’s decision, the GAO says the space agency “did not violate procurement law or regulation when it decided to make only one award.” It notes NASA gave itself the flexibility to hand out a single contract, multiple awards or none at all when it first announced the Human Landing System program.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the GAO concluded there “was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement” due to the amount of funding it had available for the project. Notably, the GAO also points in its press release that its role is not to judge the relative merits of a contract decision. Both Blue Origin and Dynetics had argued that NASA chose the most “high risk option available” since SpaceX’s bid involved its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-155125322.html">Starship rocket</a>, which at that point in the procurement process had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sn15-223714843.html">yet to land in one piece</a>.</p><p>&quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction. We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin said following the decision. &quot;We’ve been encouraged by actions in Congress to add a second provider and appropriate additional resources to NASA&#39;s pursuit to return Americans to the Moon. We’re also very encouraged by Administrator Nelson’s comments over the past week that reaffirm NASA’s original intent to provide simultaneous competition. The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later — that&#39;s the best solution for NASA and the best solution for our country.”</p><p>The decision comes mere days after Blue Origin founder and former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos offered to waive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">$2 billion</a> in payments from NASA in return for a lunar lander contract. Following Blue Origin’s protest, NASA told SpaceX to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">stop work on the Human Landing System</a> while the GAO sorted out the challenge. Today&#39;s decision allows the project and the Artemis program more broadly to move forward unless Blue Origin asks the US Court of Federal Claims to examine the case.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 2:28PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Blue Origin.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3de23178-bae2-4941-81a3-940c2bb9e56d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 18:10:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627670859</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T18:47:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7f21eca0-f166-11eb-9ffd-0b231b2e0ae9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7f21eca0-f166-11eb-9ffd-0b231b2e0ae9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clodagh Kilcoyne / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bezos on stage at a Blue Origin event.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SPACE-EXPLORATION/BEZOS]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
