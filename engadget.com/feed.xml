These minors will now be limited to just 40 minutes of use per day and can’t access the app at all between 10 PM and 6 AM.</p><p>ByteDance is also urging parents to add in more comprehensive user data to avoid kids lying about their age to get around the ban. At the same time, the company unveiled a new TikTok-esque app called Xiao Qu Xing (&quot;Little Fun Star&quot;), which offers short educational videos.</p><p>This is another fairly dramatic move as part of China’s broader crackdown on digital media and video games. Officials have recently described gaming as “spiritual opium” and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html"><ins>limited kids playtime to just three hours a week</ins></a>.</p><p>Chinese leaders are reportedly concerned that children are becoming addicted to video games, which is having a detrimental effect on their development. The science behind video game addiction is controversial and disputed, with research into the condition ongoing.</p><p>Either way, the changes to Douyin aren’t likely to be that wide ranging in isolation since it’s thought that less than half a percent of users are under 14. It’s just the overall trend that’s likely to be worth keeping an eye on, especially if this anti-game rhetoric spreads to other countries.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><strong><ins>Ikea&#39;s new $40 wireless charging pad mounts underneath your desk or table</ins></strong></a></h2><h3>No more drilling or unsightly charging plates on your table, desk or nightstand.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8976940-1abf-11ec-bbdf-5ebbce75549e" style="height:314;width:675;" alt="Image of IKEA&#39;s new under-desk charger." data-uuid="2cfee52a-c81a-3879-b045-14456b4e6894"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure></a><p>When I added an Ikea-branded wireless charging plate to my Ikea nightstand, I had to buy a custom Ikea hole saw to drill through into the top. As it turned out, Ikea furniture is sufficiently weak that I managed to scorch the wood and the paint with just the friction of the saw. The charging plate was, mercifully, big enough to cover the burn marks, so I never got any lectures about being bad at DIY. I had, however, learned my lesson that drilling out a QI charger was not my forte.</p><p>Ikea seems to feel similarly and has now launched the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><ins>Sjömärke QI</ins></a> charger, which is strong enough to charge a phone from the underside of your desk. You can glue or screw the chunky $40 unit to the underside of a suitable wooden or plastic table top. Then, all you have to do is drop your phone on the right spot and watch as about 5W of juice wafts into your phone. Or, at least, you will when it arrives in October.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading. </ins></strong></a></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sponsored by TechCrunch Disrupt </strong></p><p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=engadget&amp;display=true">Join us now for a free live virtual event you won&#39;t want to miss.</a></p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2021?promo=engadget&amp;display=true"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5feb8e0-17df-11ec-9e4f-ddf6578a8fdd" alt="TMA  Newsletter TC Disrupt Promo 9/21" data-uuid="7130e9b9-d3e4-37b3-8b2f-6caf22a60bf5"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></a><p></p></div><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html"><strong><ins>ZTE Axon 30 review: An &#39;invisible&#39; selfie camera comes at a cost</ins></strong></a></h2><h3>That cost being… awful selfies.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff41f0b0-1abf-11ec-affb-101fc42ba180" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="Image of the back plate of the ZTE Axon 30" data-uuid="5854e1a7-9c28-31bb-b1d5-83bd8e11ec24"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith</div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html"><ins>ZTE’s Axon 30</ins></a> is one of those rare smartphones offering a (pretty much) invisible front-facing camera.

That&#39;s considerably faster than what SD UHS II can do (burst read/write speeds up to 300MB/s), though slower than CFexpress Type B (1,750MB/s read and 1,000MB/s write).

They have reason to be concerned, according to a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521003791?via%3Dihub#!">MIT study</a> seen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The researchers studied glance data and found that drivers become more inattentive when using Tesla&#39;s Autopilot system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Visual behavior patterns change before and after [Autopilot] disengagement,” according to the study. “Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving.

Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that drivers may not pay as much attention to the road when using Autopilot is not exactly a shocker. What&#39;s new is that the researchers were able to see exactly where drivers were looking when the autopilot was engaged versus when it&#39;s disengaged.</p><p>Off-road glances were directed downwards and toward the center stack region, so they &quot;were presumably non-driving related.&quot; Rather, looking in those directions is typically associated with activities like glancing down at a smartphone or interacting with the center-stack infotainment touchscreen. Those were often longer with Autopilot engaged and far more frequent than off-road glances in manual driving, according to the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the name, Tesla&#39;s FSD (full self-driving) Autopilot is merely a driver assist system and far from being fully autonomous. As such, it requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and remain fully alert, but Tesla doesn&#39;t use cameras or other means to monitor the alertness part.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">latest version</a>, 10.0.1, supposedly makes more confident decisions on the road, but has so far only rolled out to a relatively small group of beta testers. Tesla plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-station-gogoro-scoots-into-a-spac-a-rivian-milestone-and-tesla-prepares-to-unleash-fsd-beta-software/">roll it out more widely</a> starting September 24th, though, and may release it to all Autopilot FSD EVs, pending a seven day trial that will track owner behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>The new release could pit Tesla against US regulators, however. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) head Jennifer Homendy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-head-on-tesla-full-self-driving-safety-170443851.html">recently said</a> that Tesla shouldn&#39;t release the latest software update until it can address &quot;basic safety issues.&quot; She also wasn&#39;t thrilled with Tesla essentially beta-testing upgrades on public streets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-using-autopilot-study-finds-072247148.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f4e39b2-59d2-4ac5-90a2-8ab7f96eb53a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:22:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632208971</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T07:23:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/062d14b0-1aa0-11ec-b4fd-b0aa89d2b72d" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/062d14b0-1aa0-11ec-b4fd-b0aa89d2b72d" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla drivers become 'inattentive' when using Autopilot, study finds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla drivers become 'inattentive' when using Autopilot, study finds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix debuts free tier for Android users in Kenya]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">Netflix</a> has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya">started offering</a> potential paying subscribers in Kenya access to some of its content at no cost. The streaming service has launched a free tier in the country that offers around one-fourth the content available to paying subscribers. It has no ads and won&#39;t even ask for payment information upon sign-up — a new subscriber will only need to confirm they&#39;re over 18 and to type in their email address and password.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it does have limitations in addition to having a smaller selection: It&#39;s only accessible on an Android device and users won&#39;t be able to download episodes for offline viewing or to cast shows on movies to a TV. In the announcement post, Netflix&#39;s Director of Product Innovation Cathy Conk, said: &quot;If you’ve never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service.&quot; The company is hoping that the free tier would entice people to pay for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Netflix made some of its content free to access. Last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-original-content-collection-125616221.html">launched</a> a &quot;watch free&quot; page where people can stream original movies such as <em>Bird Box</em> and the first episodes of popular shows like <em>Stranger Things</em> without even having to log in. The free plan is new, though, and a spokesperson told <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/netflix-free-streaming-plan-kenya-1235069573/"><em>Variety</em></a> that it&#39;s launching first in Kenya as a way for the company to gather information on how effective it is in generating paying customers. Netflix has been investing more heavily in new markets to offset its slowing growth in the US and other saturated markets and amidst an increasing number of rival streaming services. Based on what the rep said, we may see the free tier make its way to more regions in the future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-tier-android-kenya-043616484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3646f197-281a-4257-8186-b00ad29d6534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 04:36:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632198993</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T04:36:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/1ce28ae0-eb5f-11e9-97bd-b29ac30a725a" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1ce28ae0-eb5f-11e9-97bd-b29ac30a725a" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[stockcam via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[London, UK - July 31, 2018: The buttons of the streaming app Netflix, surrounded by BBC iPlayer, Speedtest, News and other apps on the screen of an iPhone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix, BBC iPlayer, News, Speedtest and other Apps on iPhone screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google’s updated iOS 15 apps support Focus Mode and iPad widgets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-ipados-15-watchos-8-iphone-ipad-watch-release-170601389.html"><ins>iOS 15 now available to download</ins></a>, developers both big and small have started updating their apps to take advantage of the operating system’s marquee features.

The move allowed the brand to work with firms like Qualcomm and Intel to source chips and other critical components for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic3-flagship-125020517.html">phones, laptops and wearables</a>. But now Honor could be in trouble as well.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/huawei-honor-security-export/2021/09/19/6d49d27c-17ef-11ec-b976-f4a43b740aeb_story.html"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, officials at four federal agencies voted last week whether to place the company on the Commerce Department’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-huawei-ceo-founder-ren-zhengfei-us-ban.html">entity list</a>. Landing there would prevent Honor from working with US companies. The <em>Post</em> reports the vote went evenly down the middle. Officials from the Pentagon and Energy Department were reportedly in favor of putting the company on the list, while their counterparts at the Commerce Department and State Department were not.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the deadlock, it’s now up to the political appointees at those agencies to decide what to do. If they can’t make a decision, the issue could eventually make its way to the desk of President Joe Biden.</p><p>The Commerce Department declined to comment on the vote when <em>The Post </em>reached out to the agency about it<em>. </em>Instead, it spoke to the subject of the entity list more broadly, noting it continually reviews the risk of a nominated company illegally sharing US technology. “We remain committed to using a full range of tools, including . . . export controls, to deter efforts by the [People’s Republic of China] and other countries … that seek to leverage technology in ways that risk harming US national security and foreign policy interests,” Brittany Caplin, a spokesperson the agency, told the outlet.</p><p>Ultimately, those making the case that Honor should land on the entity list may have difficulty convincing their counterparts that the company is a national security threat to the US. Unlike its one-time parent, Honor doesn’t sell telecommunications equipment to carriers. That means it’s not involved in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bans-installation-of-huawei-5-g-equipment-starting-september-2021-104019166.html">5G network buildouts</a> that were ostensibly at the center of the decision to place Huawei there.

According to an investor note <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"><ins>seen by </ins><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Kuo claims Apple will release three new iPhones in the second half of the year. The two high-end models will reportedly feature punch-hole display cutouts and a 48-megapixel primary camera. In other words, the expectation is that Apple will start moving away from the notch design that has defined its phones since the release of the iPhone X in 2017.</p><p>Moving to a 48-megapixel camera would also represent a significant change for the company. Recent iPhones have exclusively shipped with 12-megapixel primary cameras. By moving to a denser sensor, the company could use <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-pixel-binning-966179/"><ins>pixel binning technology</ins></a> to allow people to take high-resolution shots during the day and less noisy ones when the sun starts to set.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/"><ins>Looking further ahead</ins></a>, Kuo said Apple plans to add an in-display fingerprint sensor to the iPhone in 2023. Previously, the analyst had predicted that would happen next year, but now notes a slower than expected development process has delayed Apple’s rollout of the feature. That’s a significant delay when you consider <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-223939578.html"><ins>early reports on the iPhone 13</ins></a> lineup had suggested those phones would include in-display fingerprint sensors. Similarly, he expects the company will release a foldable iPhone in 2024, where he had previously predicted we would see the device sometime in 2023. As always, take these reports with a grain of salt. Kuo has a decent but not flawless track record when predicting Apple releases.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ming-chi-kuo-apple-iphone-14-report-172030312.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af167258-2611-4429-a100-ab35fca35b5e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 17:20:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632157777</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T17:09:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7627a90-13da-11ec-a3ff-c372aa61c8d9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7627a90-13da-11ec-a3ff-c372aa61c8d9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max back]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max back]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15 is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is now rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html"><ins>iOS 15</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html"><ins>iPadOS 15</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html"><ins>watchOS 8</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">tvOS 15</a> to iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV devices.

In a recent group interview, Lau added that this yet-to-be-named system will be based on Google&#39;s upcoming Android 13, and it&#39;ll be featured on OnePlus&#39; 2022 flagship device — likely dubbed &quot;OnePlus 10&quot; — due out first half of the year. Some existing devices will also receive this update, though no specific models were mentioned. (Lau said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-2-5-g-impressions-release-date-price-144511154.html">Nord 2</a> already features an early version of the integrated codebase, so there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;ll get the full upgrade.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef059810-1aa5-11ec-bef3-cb2ce1593c6a" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="OnePlus 9 Pro &#x00548c; Oppo Find X3 Pro" data-uuid="33690b06-5e93-39e4-bc81-3236505260b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Given that the shared OS would reduce differentiation between Lau&#39;s two brands, one might wonder which would more likely produce the &quot;perfect&quot; flagship smartphone? Never one to give a direct answer, Lau implied that he doesn&#39;t believe such a device would ever exist. He referred to an internal demographic map featuring 20 user categories, each of which tied to a combination of different needs — down to the level of product size, specific photography features, charging modes, weight and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lau&#39;s basic definition of OnePlus users is &quot;tech enthusiasts,&quot; but he added that based on this mapping, it&#39;s still impossible to satisfy everyone&#39;s needs with a single device. As such, the exec thinks the market is big enough for his two brands to avoid friendly fire. For the same reason, OnePlus&#39; Nord line will continue to co-exist with the Oppo Reno series (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-flash-magdart-android-apple-magsafe-125551887.html">Realme</a>, for that matter), though the similarity of their designs is still questionable. (Lau insisted that each brand has a dedicated design team, even after the merger.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/beeb28b0-1a24-11ec-be5f-6929c604d6cc" alt="OnePlus founder Pete Lau" data-uuid="5380acb9-60bf-3d68-96b3-4b4563885a5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>Another area which OnePlus may benefit from the integration is photography. Lau pointed out that what used to be a camera team of around 100 people is now some 700, which may allow OnePlus to take better advantage of its relationship with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-hasselblad-xpan-film-camera-setting-update-120054895.html">Hasselblad</a>, especially with their ongoing work on color science this year. The exec added that he can&#39;t say OnePlus currently has the best camera performance, but he&#39;s certain that it&#39;s &quot;definitely&quot; among the top in the industry.</p><p>Lau admitted that with his expanded role, even if he had 48-hour days, it&#39;d still be impossible for him to personally pick on every single detail on every product like he did before (let&#39;s just say it&#39;d be unlikely that he&#39;d throw a fit over a minor design issue on a logic board, as he once <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-23-oneplus-one-launch-ceo-pete-lau-interview.html">famously</a> did back in his Oppo Blu-ray player days). Instead, Lau had been spending a lot of time teaching his &quot;never settle&quot; philosophy to his new Oppo teammates over the past year or so, in the hopes of changing what used to be a leader-driven mission to true team work. It&#39;ll be a while before we get a real taste of this fruition, but Lau is &quot;confident that this new unified OS won&#39;t disappoint.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-10-oppo-unified-android-operating-system-163038315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2600f01e-bdd7-47eb-a28d-190056be04d7</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 16:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632208195</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T07:10:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/78887b40-96a6-11eb-8df5-61842fe56da9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/78887b40-96a6-11eb-8df5-61842fe56da9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eric Chan / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro 評測]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro 評測]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Finch' trailer sees man, machine and dog try to flee climate change]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple offered a brief glimpse of the Tom Hanks-led <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tom-hanks-finch-release-date-085915154.html"><em>Finch</em></a> at its recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html">iPhone 13 launch event</a>, and now you can watch the first full trailer for the upcoming sci-fi film.

The Axon 30 is a direct sequel to the Axon 20, which was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-front-selfie-camera-140003878.html">first phone to feature an in-screen camera</a>. However, the company has subsequently released the Axon 30 Pro and Ultra in some territories. So, weirdly, the vanilla Axon 30 is the last of the Axon 30 family to appear.</p><p>At $500, it’s also the cheapest — another attempt by ZTE to slide underneath the priciest smartphones around and offer a mixture of compelling features, albeit tempered by some compromises. The Axon 30’s headline feature is a much-improved under-display camera (UDC), which is almost invisible. It’s also a ZTE smartphone that’s launching in the US, which doesn’t always happen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But with increasingly strong midrange phone competition from the likes of Samsung, OnePlus and Google, does ZTE’s Axon 30 offer more than just a hidden selfie camera?</p><p>So what’s all the fuss about that camera anyway? Well, the under-screen 16-megapixel selfie shooter on the $500 Axon 30 puts the one on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 to shame. ZTE’s implementation is imperceptible unless you really, really look for it. No punch hole, no notch, no pop-up camera.</p><p>In comparison, the Fold 3’s selfie cam has a pixelated effect that signposts where the camera is and ruins the whole effect. (Yes, in Samsung’s defense, there’s another front-facing camera on the Fold 3 when it’s closed and you’re using the smaller screen.)</p><p>The difference seems to be pixel density, or according to ZTE, the composition of them, with a “special pixel matrix” that ensures the screen appears at 400 PPI — double that found on the Axon 20. If the light catches the unit just right, then yes, you can see it. You’ll probably never notice it again.</p><p>There’s also a dedicated UDC chip that apparently works to keep the camera area looking consistent with the rest of the screen. To get a closer look, I used Oppo’s Find X3 Pro, which has a microscope phone camera — perfect for visually explaining what could otherwise get very technical.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1e4cce0-1643-11ec-bdff-65a10a81eed6" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="ecb3519d-46cf-33cf-be2f-dab8e0641e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>As you can see, some pixels seem slightly smaller, or dimmer, than those surrounding them. In this close up you can see the outline of the UDC area, but at this magnification, it’s impressive that it doesn’t look more out of place. I’ll touch on the camera’s performance later, but spoiler: While it might look the part, it’s not quite capable enough.</p><p>The hidden sensor also complements the expansive 6.92-inch AMOLED screen, uninterrupted by the presence of any camera notches or holes. With a 2,460 x 1,080 resolution panel and 120Hz refresh rate, the Axon 30 is offering a flagship screen for mid-range prices. You can switch between 120 and 60Hz modes, with an automatic option letting the Axon 30 decide when to increase the frequency. On more expensive phones, like the OnePlus 9 Pro and the recently-announced<a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html"> iPhone Pro 13</a>, there are more refresh rate options that dip even lower, but at this price, this seems like a fair compromise.</p><p>Leaving it on auto is probably the best fit for most folks, but the manual options are nice — especially as there seems to be a tangible battery life benefit to the lower setting.</p><p>The phone itself is pretty big but feels solid despite its plastic back. ZTE added a translucent reflective effect across the rear of the Axon 30, which I like. I’m less enamored with the giant camera unit, however, which protrudes a few millimeters from the phone, and is likely to be more easily dinged and scratched. Sadly, this design is now everywhere.</p><p>The screen might be comparable to a high-end phone, but there are some features that didn’t make the cut at this price, like wireless charging and certified resistance against dust and water.</p><p><strong>Performance and software</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1243e550-1571-11ec-a35e-0d3efbfffa54" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="e6fc0689-11b6-342b-9305-3211a1614f15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>There are further compromises. The Axon 30 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 processor — which is a little underpowered compared to the Snapdragon 880 and 880 Plus we’re seeing in flagship Android smartphones now.</p><p>But at $500, phones like the Pixel 5a (and its Snapdragon 765G chip) are a better comparison to make. The Axon 30 has a more powerful chip than Google’s latest device, though it’s hard to notice a difference in performance between the two.</p><p>The Axon 30 handled everything I threw at it, whether that was video streaming, Stadia or playing games on the phone itself. (The Stadia app did flag that the phone wasn’t officially supported, although it worked fine for me.) There was some visible slowdown when recording video at full 4K resolution, and hopping into the gallery, but otherwise, I didn’t have many complaints.</p><p>I also have to mention that the Axon 30 isn’t exactly great for 5G support in the US. It only works on T-Mobile’s midband 5G. If you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;T, you’ll be relegated to 4G.</p><p>ZTE does know what it’s doing with smartphone power, though. The phone has a 4,200mAh battery that, when I turned the 120Hz refresh rate off, lasted a good two days of typical use before I needed to recharge. And when I did need to, it took hardly any time.</p><p>The Axon 30 supports incredibly fast charging speeds of up to 65W with the appropriate charger, which (thankfully) the phone comes with. ZTE estimates it can charge the phone to 100 percent in under an hour, but getting to 50 percent takes proportionately less time — around 20 minutes.</p><p>Software is pretty innocuous, which is generally a good thing. ZTE keeps pretty close to the stock Google experience. Its new MyOS 11 skin, based on Android 11, is pretty close to what you’d find on a Pixel. There are a few gesture quirks (shake the Axon 30 for the flashlight!) and a floating shortcut widget that can be minimized to the edges of the screen. It’s similar to Samsung’s Edge panel on its bigger phones. ZTE’s version is called Z-Pop and you can tweak the four shortcuts for system commands and app switching. That said, it’s not something that makes you think “Mmm what a memorable experience this is.”</p><p></p><h3>Cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124c97e0-1571-11ec-a75b-f4c08389583e" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="15b1c40a-7bb5-35cb-b408-cf9ce34ddafd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>While the front-facing 16-megapixel camera is technically impressive, it doesn’t take great selfies. Don’t get me wrong, it shoots far better pics than the UDC on both Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Axon 20. The work done to pixel-bin for low light performance, as well as algorithms to help the camera ‘see’ through the AMOLED panel make this the best UDC so far. But it still offers up middling to poor photos. It’s a bit of a time warp, to be honest, giving me the kind of pictures I used to get on smartphones years ago. Details are fuzzy, and any strong backlighting leads to lens flares and washout.</p><p>There’s also an AI assist mode that doesn’t seem to help much — if anything, modes like brightness seem to wash out skin tones even further, and they’re a little gray to begin with. Even if you turn this off, images seem pretty unnatural.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3d582710-1643-11ec-b766-ba2f99c72f3d" alt="ZTE Axon 30 samples" data-uuid="d27e495c-7fce-3801-bc61-5faf14aae13f"><figcaption>I couldn&#39;t mask how disappointed I was in these selfies.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>It does still capture enough detail to offer face unlock functionality if you prefer that method to fingerprint unlock. And yes, there’s also a fingerprint reader built into the screen. Face unlock worked fine for me nine times out of ten, and was plenty fast enough, but I used a combination of the two. Fingerprint unlock seemed more reliable in darker environments.</p><p>But what about the rest of the cameras? On the back, the Axon 30 has a four-camera array, led by a 64-megapixel Sony sensor. While you’ll mostly be taking pictures that fuse a lot of these pixels together for less noise and better performance in low-light, ZTE has kept the ability to take full-resolution stills if you want to. There’s also an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 5-megapixel macro camera and finally, a 2-megapixel depth sensor to aid your bokeh photography efforts and help with focus. You get up to 2x optical zoom, which is what you’d generally expect at this price point.</p><p>While shooting pictures with the Axon 30 during a family event, images of friends and family seemed particularly good. There is a softness to some shots, likely due to the photos being shrunk down from the 64-megapixel original, but the phone was able to handle most things I threw at it.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d271d4f23b974ac682bfd836cdcc2da6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b37a2d0-1642-11ec-bd3f-9ec869f25ab3" alt="ZTE Axon 30 sample images"></section><p>There’s a night mode — of course — but the Axon 30 takes pretty functional shots in low light without having to resort to using it. It did help further reduce noise and improve detail a little, but I’d also advise testing shots with AI mode on and off, as sometimes I found it meddled a little too heavily, especially with people as subjects.</p><p>And the macro camera isn’t worth your time. I suggest using the primary camera with zoom for generally better results in most situations. The problem with the macro camera seems to be that the phone has to be so close to the subject that it blocks a lot of light. That’s not great for detail-oriented photography.</p><p>Video camera modes are generally the same across most mid-range phones in recent years, and the Axon 30 isn’t hugely different. It can handle up to 4K at 60fps and a multi-camera mode lets you record from both the wide-angle and the primary camera at the same time, which is a nice trick we’ve occasionally seen on flagship phones. Due to sluggish autofocus, however, the recording quality isn’t great. If you’ve got a stable subject and good light, videos will generally come out nicely. At other times, you’ll struggle to record anything functional. Just because a phone can record 4K, it doesn’t mean you should.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1224c490-1571-11ec-afcf-825b32632843" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="6e71016f-7a16-3e39-8320-d41ca3582a07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>With the Axon 30, ZTE has proved it can successfully camouflage its under-display camera. But that doesn’t mean it’s up to the task. Image quality from the secretive selfie lens really isn’t good enough, even if the implementation is impressive. Aside from that, the Axon 30 has a gorgeous, fluid screen and a decent rear camera setup. The lack of wider 5G support in the US is frustrating in a 2021 phone, but there is still a lot here for $500. The bigger challenge is that competition is tough in the middleweight phone arena. Google’s latest Pixel, the 5a, rings in at $450, and offers better-performing cameras, front and back. If you’re struggling to pick between the two, the decision loosely boils down to a bigger screen or better selfies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b5a2e5b-32ba-4e1e-b89b-825f5a87f0fc</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:32:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632152511</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:42:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124ce600-1571-11ec-acdc-e652b6376c24" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124cbef0-1571-11ec-ad7b-052195c49d14" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the debut of new Echo Show 8 and Show 5 devices in June, we&#39;ve seen a few good deals on Amazon&#39;s first-generation smart displays since then.

While the Echo Show 5 excels as a smart alarm clock, the Echo Show 8 lets you watch videos, view photos and check out security camera feeds with a bit more comfort. The larger display is also better for video chats and it has a physical camera shutter (along with a microphone on/off button) for when you want extra privacy. If the Show 5 is a bit too small for you but the $250 Echo Show 10 is too expensive (or you&#39;re freaked out by its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">swiveling base</a>), the Show 8 will likely hit a sweet spot with its power, screen real estate and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:updated Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3tTqdUo">updated Echo Show 8</a> is only a few months old but it&#39;s much pricer at $130 and it&#39;s not significantly different from the first-generation. It has a faster octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera with auto-framing, which means it will automatically pan to track your face and keep you in view during video calls. This feature also works with all video chat services that the device supports, including Skype and Zoom, so it will come in handy if you frequently make calls with the Show 8. But you could safely skip the 2021 model if you mostly use your smart displays for weather alerts, calendar appointments, music streaming and other basic tasks.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-generation-echo-show-8-is-on-sale-for-64-right-now-152439302.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f25da33-177b-41ef-be12-f9bfb9225bd5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:24:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632151481</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:24:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter will pay over $800 million t​o settle a class action suit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001418091/000119312521276828/d197034d8k.htm"><ins>agreed to pay</ins></a> $809.5 million to settle a class action suit filed by shareholders in 2016.

Now, it&#39;s integrating another Apple product, Shazam, into its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-12-algoriddim-djay-for-ios-free-pro-dj-software.html">iOS djay app</a> with the release of iOS 15. The new feature lets you can scan your surroundings and identify any song playing, whether at an event, listening to the radio or playing sets with other DJs. Once it picks out the song, djay will instantly load it onto the virtual decks and play it in sync with the external music source.&nbsp;</p><p>Once loaded, you can create a mix with similar tracks, remix the song, apply effects and deconstruct it into components using the company&#39;s Neural Mix tech. It can also save songs into iOS 15&#39;s music recognition history in the control center, &quot;providing users with streamlined access to all of their song discoveries,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a9306fc9ad0d46f49fd10cd12fe623ed"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvcvaJzRDaQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>While this sounds like cool technology in search of an application, Algoriddim has a few use cases in mind. The main one is that you can identify a track you might hear and get it into your library with the tap of a button, or create an automated mix based on the recognized song. &quot;djay can instantly provide you with similar tracks to the one you just heard, allowing you to quickly immerse yourself in a particular style,&quot; Algoriddim told Engadget.&nbsp;</p><p>Another, more marginal use case is with back-to-back DJing. If you&#39;re playing in tandem with another DJ or in a lineup, you can pick up where the last DJ left off by identifying and syncing with their song before phasing into your own set. This goes a step beyond beat matching, letting you match the last DJ&#39;s song exactly. Mind you, many DJs may not care to replay the last DJ’s song or work with a playlist inspired by it, especially if they weren’t familiar with the tracks</p><p>The Shazam-enhanced version of iOS djay lets you save recognized music to your Tidal (music and video), SoundCloud, Beatport and Beatsource libraries (not Spotify or Apple Music). Other new features include the ability to add effects to the master audio output, enabled by new Audio Unit (extensions) features in iOS 15. That will let you better tailor the sound for broadcast or to match a PA system. Algoriddim&#39;s iOS djay update for iOS is <a href="https://www.algoriddim.com/djay-ios">now available</a> for free, or you can get the Pro version for $6.99 per month or $49.99 per year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/algoriddims-djay-i-os-app-uses-shazam-to-recognize-and-sync-with-live-music-140001218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb021e0a-c118-424b-a769-ffddd4e7dbbf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632144348</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T13:26:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/481717a0-1a0e-11ec-9dfb-92bcc8328bb6" width="2000" height="1196" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/481717a0-1a0e-11ec-9dfb-92bcc8328bb6" width="2000" height="1196" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Algoriddim]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Algoriddim's djay iOS app uses Shazam to recognize and sync live music]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Algoriddim's djay iOS app uses Shazam to recognize and sync live music]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's new Streaming Stick 4K gets Dolby Vision, HDR10+ and better Wi-Fi]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roku&#39;s $50 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-02-roku-4k-streaming-stick-players.html">Streaming Stick 4K</a> has been one of our favorite devices for years. It&#39;s cheap, pocketable and has just about every feature you&#39;d want in a streaming gadget. This year, Roku is finally adding a long-awaited feature to its new 4K stick: Dolby Vision HDR. That&#39;s something the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-ultra-dolby-vision-streaming-player-130015662.html">Roku Ultra started supporting last year</a>, and it&#39;s a particularly big deal for home theater fans. Additionally, the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Streaming Stick 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3AvIn16">Streaming Stick 4K</a> boots up around 30 percent faster than before, and its revamped wireless receiver makes Wi-Fi speeds up to twice as fast, according to Roku.</p><p>Like the HDR10 format, Dolby Vision allows for higher peak brightness levels and more nuanced dark scenes. But it can also do so dynamically, tweaking its contrast and brightness levels for every individual frame in a film or TV show. That&#39;s something HDR10 can&#39;t do, though it&#39;s since been added to the newer HDR10+ format, which the new 4K streaming stick also supports. There&#39;s a lot more Dolby Vision content out there today, though, so I&#39;d wager most people would be more excited for Dolby Vision than HDR10+ support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a0df40-1981-11ec-bafd-7e2bcfaa2c26" alt="Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021" data-uuid="dec1ca0a-4a07-356b-8dde-ec029fc2626c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roku</div></figure><p>While the 4K streaming stick ships with Roku&#39;s standard voice remote, you can also opt for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$70 Streaming Stick 4K+ bundle" href="https://amzn.to/2XtRv7O">$70 Streaming Stick 4K+ bundle</a>, which packs in the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-express-4k-rechargeable-remote-130031381.html">Voice Remote Pro</a>. Normally a $30 upgrade, that smarter clicker adds hands-free voice searching (instead of hitting a button), as well as a rechargeable battery. And if you&#39;re looking for something a bit more powerful, the $80 Wal-Mart exclusive Roku Ultra LT is also getting Dolby Vision, a faster processor and better Wi-Fi this year.</p><p>For most people, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K is likely all the streaming player you need. You can get faster speeds and more connectivity with the $100 Roku Ultra, or a nicer interface and game ecosystem with the $179 Apple TV 4K. But when it comes to just streaming video in the best possible formats, there&#39;s little need to spend more than $50. You&#39;ll be able to find the new Roku Streaming Stick 4K sometime mid-October in the US, and in the coming months across Canada, Mexico and other Latin American countries.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-dolby-vision-hdr10-130040918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e38e48c-8d94-4f23-af98-582c97aad3cd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632145473</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T13:44:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a01bf0-1981-11ec-bb6c-770f56943208" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/16a01bf0-1981-11ec-bb6c-770f56943208" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Streaming Stick 4K 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5 adds better voice support, 5.1 Roku speaker configurations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streaming-stick-4k-dolby-vision-hdr10-130040918.html">Roku&#39;s new Streaming Stick 4K </a>to take advantage of its latest software features. The Roku OS 10.5 update, which will roll out to players and TVs in the next few weeks, will be jam-packed with features to make your streaming life easier. There&#39;s expanded Roku Voice support, which will let you ask players (with supported remotes) to start playing content from Netflix, Spotify and most other channels. And the company has added a Live TV Channel Guide to help find free TV content (so far there are more than 200 live channels to sift through).</p><p>But more importantly for the Roku faithful, there are even more configurations for the company&#39;s wireless speakers. Roku OS 10.5 will let you use any of the company&#39;s soundbars — the Streambar, Streambar Pro and Smart Soundbar — as a center channel flanked by Roku wireless speakers. Put that setup together with two more rear speakers and a wireless sub, and voila, you&#39;ve got a full-fledged 5.1 surround solution. Previously, you were only able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-roku-surround-sound-speakers-soundbar.html">use Roku&#39;s soundbars as all of your front channels</a> (left, right and center).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddc1150-1983-11ec-beff-a85753283c69" alt="Roku OS 10.5" data-uuid="605257c6-0359-3d4f-87f0-e476883d6bce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roku</div></figure><p>From what I recall of Roku&#39;s earlier surround solution, it sounded more than adequate for a small room. I haven&#39;t heard the company&#39;s 5.1 setup yet, but generally having more speakers is always better. At the very least, you can expect clearer dialog and better front channel separation. I can&#39;t say if it&#39;s worth shelling out up to  $630 for all of Roku&#39;s speakers ($300 for four wireless speakers, $180 for the StreamBar Pro, and $150 for the wireless subwoofer), but it&#39;s nice to have the flexibility to build out a full system if you&#39;ve already invested in a few of them.</p><p>Roku OS 10.5 will also add some audio improvements for headphones. When you connect a wireless headset to the Roku mobile app, it will adjust your sync settings based on the type of headphone you&#39;re using. You&#39;ll also be able to use your smartphone camera to adjust the audio delay even further. That&#39;s a useful feature for anyone using Bluetooth headphones, where audio delay issues are fairly common.</p><p>To coincide with expanded Spotify voice support, Roku is also adding a new music and podcasts row to its system search. You&#39;ll be able to see results from Spotify&#39;s entire library, but more importantly it opens the door for better audio app support on Roku OS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-os-10-5-update-voice-speakers-130013021.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b45363a-b4d0-432a-998b-88a8f0b0e8c5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 13:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632082837</ingested><modified>2021-09-19T20:20:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddbc330-1983-11ec-9c1f-88e0d0fcc21b" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ddbc330-1983-11ec-9c1f-88e0d0fcc21b" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku OS 10.5]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
