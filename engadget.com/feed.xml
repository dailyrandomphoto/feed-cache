That may not sound like much, considering plenty of escape rooms are cheesy monuments to corporate team-building exercises and gentrification, but I mean it as a compliment. <em>Deathloop</em> uses the fundamentals of old-school locked-room mysteries to deliver a rich and stylish universe driven by intrigue, action and strategy. The main difference between <em>Deathloop</em> and an actual escape room is, well, all the death.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a fair amount of dying in <em>Deathloop</em>. Dying is a core mechanic of the game, and it’s the first thing players actually do in the campaign, called Break the Loop. The opening scene has Colt, the main character, on his back with a murderous woman called Julianna sitting on top of him, pressing a massive blade to his chest. After some banter, she plunges the knife into Colt’s heart, and he sputters and dies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d13d10-1434-11ec-bff7-06051b7056a0" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="e0984436-4fdd-3a6d-a3a1-1e024fe47e1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>And then the game begins. Colt awakens on a cold, empty beach littered with bottles, and he makes his way to a compound built into the side of the sea wall. As he walks, glowing words appear around the environment, as if a loved one is leaving words of encouragement and warning for him. Colt is confused — he doesn’t even know his own name at this point, let alone how he got here or who’s trying to talk to him.</p><p>The identity of the message-writer is just one of a dozen or so core mysteries in <em>Deathloop</em>, and these are the driving force of the campaign. Colt’s job is to explore Blackreef, the island where he’s been trapped in an infinite respawn cycle, and learn as much about its leaders and technology as possible, in order to burn it all down. Blackreef is a retrofuturistic bubble populated by residents who split their time between partying and violently defending their consequence-free way of life, and Colt can either sneak or shoot his way through their ranks.</p><p>In action, <em>Deathloop</em> feels a lot like Dishonored<em>&nbsp;</em>(of course), with a chaser of <em>We Happy Few </em>and <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>. It’s mechanically mature and narratively dense, but best of all, it doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d0eef0-1434-11ec-9cd4-676d4be2cfbb" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="cf74e826-efdd-3266-9e4e-c34d5a095237"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p><em>Deathloop</em> is one of the few first-person action games that I can successfully play in stealth mode, silently taking down enemies, hacking turrets and sniping from the rooftops in order to stay alive. Usually with games like this — I’m thinking Deus Ex and Far Cry — I intend to play stealthily, but it doesn’t work out. I get too close to an enemy, or miss my headshot, or forget about that security camera, and I end up just throwing a grenade and emptying my magazine, recklessly running into danger.</p><p><em>Deathloop</em> invites the kind of stealth that I can sustain. The environments are endlessly climbable, offering plenty of vantage points for Colt to survey and mark his enemies, tracking their movements and revealing the kinds of weapons they’re carrying. If something in <em>Deathloop</em> looks scalable, it likely is, opening up the game world in all directions. Additionally, if I accidentally alert the enemies in one location, I don’t feel like I have to abandon my plans and roll in guns blazing. Generally speaking, I can find some cover, pick off the folks that follow me, and return to the rest of the mission in stealth mode. My favorite weapons in these moments are the Tribunal and the PT-6 Spiker, both of which are silent and deliver instant-kill headshots.</p><p>I’d like to blame the success of <em>Deathloop</em>’s stealth mechanics on my own skills or the masterful sense of level design coming out of Arkane Studios, but it might just be the game’s hit-or-miss AI. There are times it feels too easy to sneak up on enemies, and moments when they fail to react appropriately to Colt’s presence, standing still for seconds too long, piling up in hallways or ignoring nearby scuffles. It’s not every encounter, and there are still plenty of moments when I’m bested by the NPCs, but it’s enough that I’d classify the enemy AI in <em>Deathloop</em> as OK, rather than good.</p><section data-eng-breakout="968d877fc48b4fb1b23afcb02afe727e" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e722df80-1434-11ec-bffd-c86b67797a0b" alt="Deathloop"></section><p>Along his way, Colt picks up a variety of weapons and ultra-high-tech artifacts that grant him special abilities and perks. There are Trinkets, which are small glowing items that enhance whatever gun they’re attached to, and Slabs, which give Colt — and his enemies — superhuman powers like invisibility, telekinesis and short-distance teleportation. Once collected, the Slabs are swappable in Colt&#39;s loadout, and they tend to be tons of fun.</p><p>Blackreef is controlled by eight Visionaries of the AEON Program, one of whom is Julianna, and the only way to escape the island is for Colt to kill them all in a single day, breaking the loop. However, it’s not as simple as speedrunning through Blackreef in order to take them all out. Colt has deep ties to the AEON Program and the Visionaries all keep their own schedules, meaning a successful assassination run will require hours of information-gathering and strategizing. And, it turns out, dying.</p><p>Once he gets going, Colt is able to die twice during any playthrough with few consequences; he’s simply transported to a previous location and allowed to keep going, health restored. On the third death, however, he’s sent back to that bottle-lined beach, resources depleted.</p><p>He also loses his gear after a full day of activity, regardless of progress. <em>Deathloop</em> is divided into four times — morning, noon, afternoon and night — and after each complete sequence, Colt is beached. Certain missions can only be completed at specific times of day, so players have to plan their attacks accordingly, either shifting time forward or simply delaying until the next loop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d8de30-1434-11ec-b6f5-92e17974b8ad" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="ee8dff1b-e694-31a1-a31b-c4a7a4e649e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Eventually, Colt gains the ability to carry some slabs, trinkets and weapons with him between loops, though he has to infuse the items he wants to keep with a resource called Residiuum. Colt can harvest Residiuum from the shiny, glitched-out objects in Blackreef, or by killing visionaries and absorbing their energy. Residiuum can then be applied to specific items in Colt&#39;s kit, holding them for good.</p><p>With all of these trinkets, slabs, weapons, Residiuum, visionaries and loops, there’s a lot to keep tabs on in <em>Deathlooop</em>. The amount of <em>stuff </em>in the game is overwhelming at times, and it’s complicated by an intense plot filled with overlapping, time-bending mysteries. Small scraps of paper and brief audio recordings often contain crucial bits of information, rewarding players who obsessively explore every bookshelf, desk and dead-end with reams of notes and leads. The game does a good job of organizing all of these details in the resource-management screen, but overall, <em>Deathloop</em> demands full and complete attention, lest you completely lose the plot.</p><p>For those who pay attention, the story and environment of Blackreef unravels beautifully, with important secrets hidden in plain view, and new parts of the world opening and closing depending on the time of day. From this perspective, the density of things to collect, use and learn in <em>Deathloop </em>makes perfect sense. This game is built on the idea of replaying the same four maps again and again — Colt needs something new to do every time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef820610-1439-11ec-b4fb-23dd125413cc" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="313780e8-54ee-3412-9f8e-83d8e58f8223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Julianna is a charming constant in <em>Deathloop</em>, generally talking shit and fleshing out the background of Blackreef. She’s also the star of the game’s second mode, Protect the Loop. Here, players are able to invade the games of friends or strangers, playing as Julianna and hunting down Colt as he tries to complete a mission. She has her own loadout, trinkets and slabs, including a masquerade ability that lets her trade appearances with allied NPCs — meaning, everyone except Colt.</p><p>Protect the Loop is marked by long periods of silence and inactivity, followed by furious gunfire and death. Colt can take any route he wants through the various maps, and Julianna has to actively hunt him down or wait for him to appear near the objective. She may be able to disguise herself, but she only has one life, while Colt has to die three times to make it final. This results in a delicious cat-and-mouse game that’s different with each new player.</p><p>That said, Protect the Loop is also where I’ve encountered the most technical issues. I played on PS5, and one round crashed fully right after launching, while two more were completely unplayable from my end, repeatedly setting my Julianna back a few frames until Colt finally showed up and shot her. That’s in comparison with four glitch-free rounds. My recommendation here is to use an ethernet cable, rather than Wi-Fi, and make sure your friends do, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cb4015996930402d9c4ab7abb95233e6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef8d29a0-1439-11ec-8af7-a33e54a825d6" alt="Deathloop"></section><p><em>Deathloop</em> is incredibly dense, but it’s also inherently forgiving. Relying on death as a mechanic in Break the Loop takes the sting out of failing a cycle or two, since retrying is built into the narrative. Colt uncovers helpful information in most of his runs, even when he ends up dead — like, <em>dead</em> dead — and it feels like there’s always something new to uncover in Blackreef, no matter how many times he returns to the same location. If it does ever get old, there’s always the option to Protect the Loop.</p><p>And then Break the Loop. And then Protect the Loop. And then Break the Loop.</p><p>You get the idea.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7b92d17-9157-482a-950e-51626057c3ea</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:01:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631526903</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T09:55:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bethesda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo significantly cuts Switch price in Europe]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has officially lowered the suggested retail price of the base Switch model in Europe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/nintendo_switch_base_model_price_officially_reduced_to_p259e269_across_europe"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> has reported, hopefully telegraphing a similar drop in the US.

It’s hard to describe either side as an out-and-out loser or winner;  Apple must allow App Store developers to direct users to other payment systems, which would let them bypass the 30 percent cut of in-app payments that Apple takes. Judge Gonzales Rogers also ruled, however, that the App Store doesn&#39;t violate antitrust law. She ruled against Epic in Apple&#39;s counterclaim for breach of contract. Epic has to pay Apple $3.65 million.</p><p>The latest development: Epic has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-appeals-apple-lawsuit-ruiling-193324451.html">filed an appeal </a>against that ruling.

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#39;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p><p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &quot;high delta-V&quot; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#39;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p><p>While the request didn&#39;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#39;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#39;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/defense-department-nuclear-spacecraft-propulsion-211213947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20e61779-f603-4b41-8a82-24af2a98d4a2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 21:12:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631481136</ingested><modified>2021-09-12T21:12:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic appeals ruling in lawsuit against Apple over App Store rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">scored a notable victory</a> in its lawsuit against Apple, but it&#39;s dissatisfied enough to keep the legal battle going. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle">reports</a> Epic has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal">filed an appeal</a> against the ruling.

While Epic did succeed in forcing Apple to allow links to third-party purchasing systems, it didn&#39;t receive concessions on allowing third-party app stores or obtaining &quot;fair competition&quot; for in-app purchasing.

Disney didn&#39;t say when you might expect on-demand versions of these titles, whether on Disney+ or rival services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is partly a reaction to the relatively strong theater-only releases of summer extravaganzas like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>. While COVID-19 still hurt box office numbers (<em>Shang-Chi</em>&#39;s $75.5 million US opening paled in comparison to multiple Disney 2019 releases), the revenue may have been enough to justify returning to pre-pandemic distribution.</p><p>There&#39;s also the matter of placating key factions. Disney said it has a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html">pay talent fairly</a> for hybrid theater-and-digital relases, but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Scarlett Johansson&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html"><em>Black Widow</em> lawsuit</a> plays a role in considering Disney+ launches. The company might not want to risk further trouble with actors and others whose income depends on theatrical performance. And then there&#39;s the theaters themselves. When chains like AMC vowed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trolls-word-tour-pvod-amc-062745004.html">pull Universal movies</a> even when many locations were closed, Disney might not be willing to provoke a similar confrontation as theaters resume business.</p><p>This and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">Warner Bros.&#39; 2022 return to theaters</a> supports the expectations of many cynics — that studios only saw day-one streaming access as a temporary necessity that would disappear the moment it was reasonably safe to watch on big screens. That&#39;s not completely shocking when the movie industry&#39;s business model still revolves around theaters, but any fundamental shifts in strategy might not happen for a long, long time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8719f9c-54f8-4def-8683-dd5f65889f40</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 16:13:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631376790</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T16:13:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and 'rose charts']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Crimean War, hospitals of the day weren&#39;t so much centers of healing or recovery as they were the places where injured combatants went to die slightly more slowly. Turkey&#39;s Scutari hospital was one such notorious example. Converted by the British Empire from army barracks, Scutari lacked every imaginable amenity, from basic sanitation to sufficient ventilation, this &quot;hospital&quot; served as a potent incubator for myriad infectious diseases — that is until Florence Nightingale and her team of volunteer nurses arrived in 1854.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>Maladies of Empire</em></a> by Jim Downs explores how many aspects of modern medicine are borne on the backs of humanity&#39;s most abhorrent impulses, though in the excerpt below, Downs illustrates how one woman&#39;s unyielding tenacity and fastidious record keeping helped launch the field of preventative medicine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3ea0be0-0fff-11ec-b5cb-197e93c2d343" alt="Maladies of Empire" data-uuid="3cd128b6-22ae-3b1b-aba7-030287f4a386"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Belknap Press</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from </em><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>MALADIES OF EMPIRE: HOW COLONIALISM, SLAVERY, AND WAR TRANSFORMED MEDICINE </em></a><em>by JIM DOWNS, published by The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

She took notes on everything from cleanliness to the quantity of supplies to diet to the placement of latrines and graveyards.</p><p>She also carefully examined the physical space. She took careful note of the size of the wards, the condition of the roof, and the quality, size, and placement of the windows. In her book on the health of the British army, like Thomas Trotter and others who wrote about the importance of fresh air, she pointed to the problem of improper ventilation, and she devoted an entire section to “bad ventilation.” She quoted the report of the sanitary commission, which remarked on the “defective state of the ventilation” in the Barrack Hospital. There were only “a few small openings here and there,” so that there was no way for the “hot and foul” air to escape. As an adherent of the miasma theory, she believed that diseases were spread through the air and advocated for ventilation to release the “foul air” from hospitals.</p><p>In addition to inadequate ventilation, Nightingale pointed to poor drainage and badly designed sewers and plumbing. In her testimony to the royal commission, Nightingale reported on the filthy conditions she found in the Barrack Hospital when she arrived. “The state of the privies... for several months, more than an inch deep in filth, is too horrible to describe.” She observed six dead dogs under one of the windows, and a dead horse lay in the aqueduct for weeks. The drinking water was dirty; once she saw used hospital uniforms in the water tank. Rats and insects abounded, and “the walls and ceilings were saturated with organic matter.”</p><p>In the conclusion to her report on the health of the British Army, she explained, “We have much more information on the sanitary history of the Crimean campaign than we have upon any other, but because it is a complete exam (history does not afford its equal) of an army, after failing to the lowest ebb of disease and disaster from neglects committed, rising again to the highest state of health and efficiency from remedies applied.</p><p>&quot;It is the whole experiment on a colossal scale.” She pointed out that during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign, mortality exceeded that of the plague of 1665 as well as that of recent cholera epidemics. But during the last six months of the war, after sanitary reforms had been made, “we had... a mortality among our sick little more than that among our healthy Guards at home.”</p><p>Using mortality data that she had collected during the war, along with domestic mortality statistics, Nightingale showed that between 1839 and 1853, mortality among soldiers was much higher than among civilian men: “of 10,000 soldiers [at the age of 20], 7,077 live to the age of 39, out of whom 135 die in the next year of age; whereas out of 10,000 civilians at the age of 20, 8,253 attain the age of 39, and of those 106 die in the year of age following.” Nearly all mortality among soldiers was the result of disease; “actual losses in battle form a very small part of the calamities of a long war.” Nightingale classified the causes of death as “zymotic diseases” (which in the nineteenth century referred to infectious diseases such as fevers, measles, and cholera), “chest and tubercular diseases,” and “all other diseases (including violent deaths).” Nightingale was critical of the army’s classification system for diseases. At the bottom of a chart, she notes, “Bronchitis and influenza have no place in the Army nomenclature. The chronic catarrh of the Army Returns is believed to be really phthisis, in the great majority of cases; acute catarrh comprehends both epidemic catarrh, or influenza and bronchitis.”</p><p>Nightingale presented statistics using charts, tables, and diagrams, which were just beginning to appear in research reports, to make it easier for readers to visualize the comparison she was making. She developed a new kind of graphic, called a “rose chart,” also known as a coxcomb chart or polar area diagram, to present mortality data from the Crimean War. Each chart, which is laid out like a pie, shows data from one year, with the slices representing months. Each slice is divided into colored segments whose area is proportional to the number of deaths.</p><p>One segment is for deaths from wounds, a second for “preventable or mitigable zymotic diseases,” and a third for all other causes. A quick glance at the charts of deaths from April 1854 to March 1855 and April 1855 to March 1856 is enough to show that many more deaths were caused by disease than by combat, and that overall mortality decreased in the second year.</p><p>To further make visible the dangers of unsanitary hospitals, Nightingale gathered mortality data for matrons, nuns, and nurses working in fifteen London hospitals who died of the “zymotic diseases” of fever and cholera. She presented tables, which she notes William Farr compiled for her, showing that the mortality rate of the nursing staff was much higher than that of the female population in London; in addition, women working in hospitals were more likely to die of zymotic diseases than were other women. She used these figures to argue for the “very great importance” of hygiene in hospitals. “The loss of a well-trained nurse by preventible [sic] disease,” she wrote, “is a greater loss than is that of a good soldier from the same cause. Money cannot replace either, but a good nurse is more difficult to find than a good soldier.”</p><p>In her book Notes on Hospitals, she retold the story of the British prisoners of war who died in a crowded jail cell in India in 1756: “Shut up 150 people in a Black hole of Calcutta, and in twenty-four hours an infection is produced so intense that it will, in that time, have destroyed nearly the whole of the inmates.” Nightingale’s reference to the case is evidence for its status as the prototypical illustration of the need for ventilation. And the fact that it took place in India shows how British medical authorities used information from around the empire.</p><p>As a result of her work with large numbers of patients in the Crimean War, Nightingale framed her analysis like an epidemiologist, in terms of populations. She focused on how disease spread within a group. She devoted her energies not to changing bedpans or dressing wounds but to studying the structure of hospitals, analyzing statistics, and figuring out how to increase ventilation.</p><p>The war provided her the opportunity to compare mortality rates in varied settings: crowded hospitals, shabby tents, and wooden huts. It also underscored to her the importance of preventive measures, which constitutes one of the major tenets of modern epidemiology. By publishing her observations, her insights, and guidelines for hospitals to follow, she hoped to provide a set of rules and guidelines for physicians to follow to prevent the spread of disease. While efforts to ensure proper hygiene as a way to guard against illness can be traced to Mesopotamian civilization and Sanskrit writings from 2000 BCE, Nightingale’s warnings, in particular, and sanitary reform, more generally, sparked a critical turning point in the middle of the nineteenth century that gave rise to preventive medicine. This transformed military medicine from an enterprise that largely focused on treatment and surgery to one that began to engage epidemiological questions and issues.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-maladies-of-empire-jim-downs-belknap-press-153044507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f1d7fff-3b7f-4dcc-9236-865cca0a76b7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 15:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631045430</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T20:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and &#39;rose charts&#39;]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla rolls out Full Self Driving 10 beta with more confident decision making]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html">last big Full Self Driving beta</a> was about enabling more semi-autonomous features off the highway, its newest release is focused more on helping you trust those features. <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/11/tesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet/">notes</a> Tesla has started rolling out a Full Self Driving 10 beta that, from early <a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1436624804107354117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436624804107354117%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2021%2F09%2F11%2Ftesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet%2F">reports</a>, appears to make smarter and more confident decisions off the highway.

As the publication notes, that damage can be permanent. A simple Google search will surface <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/594197/Will+shaking+damage+the+image+stabilization">posts</a> over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/76ezfz/psa_motorcycle_vibration_can_damage_cell_phone/">past</a> few years by users whose cameras were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/ht0sv3/psa_iphone_11_camera_destroyed_via_motorcycle/">ruined</a> after they mounted their iPhone on their bike, mostly so they can use it for navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple didn&#39;t say why it&#39;s issuing a warning now, it did explain the reason why attaching the iPhone to a motorcycle can destroy its camera. The company said that the camera&#39;s optical image stabilization (OIS) and closed-loop autofocus (AF) features can be damaged by long-term exposure to high-amplitude vibrations. A camera&#39;s OIS makes it possible for a device&#39;s gyroscope to sense movement.

That&#39;s because the social network has been giving them flawed and incomplete information on how users interact with posts and links on the website, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has been giving academics access to its data over the past couple of years to track the spread of misinformation on its platform. It promised researchers transparency and access to <em>all</em> user interaction, but the data the company has been giving them reportedly only includes interactions for about half of its users in the US. Further, most of the users whose interactions were included in the reports are the ones who engage with political posts enough to make their leanings clear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In an email to researchers<em> The Times</em> saw, Facebook apologized for the &quot;inconvenience [it] may have caused.&quot; The company also told them that it&#39;s fixing the issue, but that it could take weeks due to the sheer volume of data it has to process. Facebook told the researchers, though, that the data they received for users outside the US isn&#39;t inaccurate.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones blamed the data inaccuracy to a &quot;technical error,&quot; which the company is apparently &quot;working swiftly to resolve.&quot; As <em>The Times</em> notes, it was University of Urbino associate professor Fabio Giglietto who first discovered the inaccuracy. Giglietto compared the data handed over to researchers with the &quot;Widely Viewed Content Report&quot; the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">published</a> publicly in August and found that the results didn&#39;t match.&nbsp;</p><p>Other researchers raised concerns after that report was published. Alice Marwick, a researcher from the University of North Carolina, told <em>Engadget</em> that they couldn&#39;t verify those results, because they had no access to the data Facebook used. The company reportedly held a call with researchers on Friday to apologize. Megan Squire, one of those researchers, told<em> The Times</em>: &quot;From a human point of view, there were 47 people on that call today and every single one of those projects is at risk, and some are completely destroyed.&quot;</p><p>Some researchers have been using their own tools to gather information for their research, but in at least one instance, Facebook cut off their access. In August, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html">disabled</a> the accounts associated with the NYU Ad Observatory project. The team used a browser extension to collect information on political ads, but the social network said it was &quot;unauthorized scraping.&quot; At the time, Laura Edelson, the project&#39;s lead researcher, told <em>Engadget</em> that Facebook is silencing the team because its &quot;work often calls attention to problems on its platform.&quot; Edelson added: &quot;If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-researchers-incomplete-data-050143486.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab041706-e7c4-4c48-836a-755b2be42eaf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 05:01:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631336557</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T05:02:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 23: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

Bird has also put in place incentives to encourage safe riding and responsible parking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bird-bike-rollout-san-diego-213100811.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d476ec34-3d5e-4e8b-bff5-5465a2402f39</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 21:31:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631307070</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T20:51:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/01bfadb0-1277-11ec-9afb-88acb94520b9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/01bfadb0-1277-11ec-9afb-88acb94520b9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bird]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bird Bike and Bird Three Scooter]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bird Bike and Bird Three Scooter]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra actually has more new Elite earbuds, but you likely can't get them]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Jabra launched its $80 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Elite 3 wireless</a> headphones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">last month</a>, it also announced the pricier, more-premium Elite 7 Active and Pro models, which cost $180 and $200. But it actually also released another sub-$100 product called <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-2##100-91400003-40">the Elite 2</a> — we just can&#39;t buy it here in the US. The company&#39;s product page says &quot;This product is not available in your country&quot; when accessed from America.</p><p>Our senior news editor Billy Steele noticed when he was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">reviewing the Elite 3</a> that there was a listing for what appeared to be an unannounced Elite 2 in Jabra&#39;s app. We&#39;ve since learned that the Elite 2 actually did get released, but only in countries like India, China, Russia and Turkey for now. According to the company, the Elite 2 indeed launched in &quot;select markets worldwide.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These buds are similar to the Elite 3, keeping the same overall shape and a similar design but with small differences. There&#39;s one fewer microphone per side for calls, no ambient sound mode or sidetone and the case only holds two charges instead of three. Otherwise, the Elite 2 is basically the same as the pair we reviewed, with 6mm speakers, EQ presets, Alexa support, one-touch Spotify playback and Google&#39;s Fast Pair for those using it with Android.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://tavesper.tech/2021/09/jabra-elite-2-malaysia/"><em>Tavesper.tech</em></a>, the Elite 2 is available in Malaysia for RM299, which is about $72. That&#39;s only about $8 cheaper than the Elite 3. Plus, prices could be different in other regions. On this <a href="https://www.macnificent.co.za/accessories/iphone-ipad-accessories/headphones/jabra-elite-2-true-wireless-in-ear-earbuds-dark-grey-detail">South African website</a>, for example, it&#39;s going for about 1,200 Rand, which is close to $85. For now, we can&#39;t directly compare prices without knowing what it could cost stateside, and just because it&#39;s not currently available in the US doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t ever come here eventually. You can find out more about the Elite 2 on its <a href="https://www.argos-support.co.uk/instruction-manual/7244096-jabra-elite-2-sport-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black.pdf">instruction manual published on European retailer Argos&#39; website</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-2-not-in-america-200543048.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc4ad2b5-114b-474e-b70c-c2e38676b6d2</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 20:14:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631303413</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T19:50:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff43d1e0-126e-11ec-b79b-0171e62e6c9c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff43d1e0-126e-11ec-b79b-0171e62e6c9c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 2]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
