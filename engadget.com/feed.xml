The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-opens-cyberattack-defense-center-11625778530">reports</a> that NYC has launched a long-in-the-making Cyber Critical Services and Infrastructure (CCSI) operations center in Manhattan to defend against major cyberattacks.</p><p>The initiative&#39;s members are a mix of public and private sector organizations that include Amazon, the Federal Reserve Bank, IBM, the New York Police Department and multiple healthcare providers. If a cyberattack hits, they&#39;ll ideally cooperate closely to both overcome the attack and muster a city response if the digital offensive hobbles NYC&#39;s infrastructure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Politicians first floated the idea in 2017, but CCSI has been a strictly virtual initiative until now.</p><p>NYC is the first US city to have such a cyberdefense center, but it might not be the last. Cities like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-06-atlanta-ransomware-attack-struck-mission-critical-services.html">Atlanta</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/baltimore-public-school-system-ransomware-attack-160600564.html">Baltimore</a> have reeled from ransomware attacks in recent years, in numerous cases taking a long time (and a lot of money) to recover. A coordinated operations facility could help those cities bounce back quickly from a wide variety of hacks, or at least mitigate the damage.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-cyberattack-defense-center-131728692.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9c5c7454-8d18-4b03-8a41-090a9c846bd6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 13:17:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625836650</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T13:17:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/31f575f0-e0b3-11eb-b77b-9391f6a80bd1" width="6476" height="4122" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/31f575f0-e0b3-11eb-b77b-9391f6a80bd1" width="6476" height="4122" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gary Hershorn via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JERSEY CITY, NJ - JUNE 27: The sun sets on the skyline of lower Manhattan, One World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty in New York City on June 27, 2021 as seen from Jersey City, New Jersey.

wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As studios and streaming services continue to strike deals, jump ship and generally settle with preferred partners, it’s getting harder to figure out which movies will be available where — and when. Amazon’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html"> latest deal with Universal</a> is case in point.</p><p>Amazon has struck a multi-year deal for exclusive Prime Video streaming rights for Universal&#39;s live-action theatrical releases, which will kick in next year. According to a report from <em>Deadline</em>, it will cover blockbusters such as J<em>urassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out</em> director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p><p>However, the deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Just days ago, Universal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">struck an agreement with its NBCUniversal sibling, Peacock</a>, for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><p>So, that should mean that within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for a 10-month run, before going back to Peacock for at least another four months.</p><p>Universal’s plan seems to be shuffling the release schedule around different streaming platforms to ensure its movies get to more audiences across different services — while keeping said platforms satisfied with what they get. The trouble is you might struggle to find the film you want to watch — or miss the chance to see it — unless you’re paying a lot of attention to movie release dates.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm and ASUS made a phone for Snapdragon Insiders</a></h2><h3>An expensive phone for spec die-hards.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" style="height:1152;width:2048;" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="4b7b5ecc-33c8-32ed-8f98-144818e9d107"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure></a><p>ASUS and Qualcomm have teamed up to make a smartphone that shows off some of the latter&#39;s mobile tech. Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program, it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>Oddly, it won’t pack the very highest-end Qualcomm mobile processor (Snapdragon 888+), but a Snapdragon 888 5G chipset, with what’s described as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E. There’s also 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p><p>The screen, too, is specced out: It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and up to 1,200 nits of brightness. The rear 64-megapixel camera will also be capable of recording 8K video.</p><p>It’ll be one of the first phones to support Snapdragon Sound, which features low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz. Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds, which is a nice touch. The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It will cost a heady $1,499 when it arrives later this summer. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Harley-Davidson&#39;s latest LiveWire electric motorcycle is a more affordable ride</a></h2><h3>The first electric motorcycle from the company&#39;s LiveWire brand is here.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9ea3d380-e00f-11eb-aede-c48e63b59d01" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="LiveWire One" data-uuid="75372d5a-89ef-3c96-a597-f8160d0ff700"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harley-Davidson</div></figure></a><p>The most eye-catching feature of Harley-Davidson’s new LiveWire One is its price tag. The electric motorcycle will cost $21,999. That’s almost $8,000 less than the $29,799 the original LiveWire sold for when it came out in 2019. With federal subsidies, Harley-Davidson expects most US buyers will be able to get the LiveWire One for less than $20,000.</p><p>Harley-Davidson has also improved the motorcycle’s range. Driving on slower city streets, the LiveWire One can travel 146 miles on a single charge, the company claims. By comparison, its predecessor was limited to a maximum of about 110 city miles. Using a DC fast charger, the company says you can get the LiveWire One’s battery from dead to a full charge in about an hour.</p><p>The second electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson will initially be limited to customers who live in California, New York and Texas since only 12 dealerships in those states are authorized to sell the LiveWire One at the moment. However, the bike will be available at more dealers come this fall. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-033027788.html">Square will build a bitcoin hardware wallet</a></h2><h3>But it&#39;s still early days for the project.</h3><h3></h3><p>Square is building a bitcoin hardware wallet and service, a month after company CEO Jack Dorsey announced it&#39;s considering the move.

Netflix has long been releasing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-11-netflix-strong-black-legends-podcast.html">companion talk shows</a> for its original movies and TV series, including ones for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-crown-companion-podcast.html"><em>The Crown</em></a>, <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Stranger Things</em>.

Now, the e-commerce giant has expanded support for the feature, allowing you to host or join a Watch Party on Fire TV devices. While Amazon didn&#39;t make a big announcement for the feature&#39;s arrival on the platform, it updated the list of compatible devices on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/adlp/watchparty?&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=f543dd24c56857fcfe14091e6163c1da&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Watch Party&#39;s FAQ</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-prime-video-watch-party-support-fire-tv/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>. The section now says that you can co-watch with friends and fellow Prime members on a Fire TV device within the Prime Video app.</p><p>You still can&#39;t co-watch movies and shows with friends on mobile, but you can access the chat section of a Watch Party when you update to the latest version of the Prime Video app for phones and tablets. That&#39;ll give you an easy way to talk to other participants without access to a computer, as well as an easy way to create and share Watch Party invites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon originally launched the feature on Twitch back in 2019, allowing streamers to watch videos with their viewers. The version available from within Prime Video itself is more suitable if you&#39;re not a streamer and just want to watch with people you&#39;re close to. All participants in a party must also have Prime subscriptions, though, and they must rent or purchase the movie or show the host is watching.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-prime-video-watch-parties-091026377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f94d0f0-f7a3-45ef-9d3d-303ed0f9188f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 09:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625821835</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T09:10:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0df61120-e08e-11eb-bfff-a6f7666cc22b" width="1500" height="972" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0df61120-e08e-11eb-bfff-a6f7666cc22b" width="1500" height="972" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Major crypto scammer sentenced to 15 years in prison]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The mastermind behind what the government says is one of the largest cryptocurrency Ponzi schemes prosecuted in the US has been <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/cryptocurrency-fraudster-sentenced-15-years-money-laundering-and-securities-fraud-multi">sentenced</a> to 15 years in prison. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faze-clan-suspends-crypto-scheme-players-221223343.html">crypto scams</a> have been getting <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/">increasingly common</a>, Swedish citizen Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson defrauded thousands of victims and stole tens of millions of dollars over a period that lasted almost a decade. He pleaded guilty to securities and wire fraud, as well as money laundering charges on March 4th.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Department of Justice, Karlsson ran his fraudulent investment scheme from 2011 until he was arrested in Thailand in 2019. He targeted financially insecure individuals, such as seniors, persuading them to use cryptocurrency to purchase shares in a business he called &quot;Eastern Metal Securities.&quot; Based on information from court documents, he promised victims huge payouts tied to the price of gold, but the money they handed over wasn&#39;t invested at all. It was moved to Karlsson&#39;s personal bank accounts instead and used to purchase expensive homes and even resorts in Thailand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To keep his scheme running for almost a decade, he&#39;d rebrand and would show victims account statements in an effort to convince them that their funds are secure. Karlsson would then give them various excuses for payout delays and even falsely claimed to be working with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the sentencing, US District Judge Charles R. Breyer ordered his Thai resorts and accounts to be forfeited. He was also ordered to pay his victims in the amount of $16,263,820.</p><p>Acting US Attorney Stephanie Hinds of the Northern District of California said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The investigation into Roger Karlsson’s fraud uncovered a frighteningly callous scheme that lasted more than a decade during which Karlsson targeted thousands of victims, including financially vulnerable seniors, to callously rob them of their assets and all to fuel an extravagant lifestyle surrounded by luxury condominiums and lavish international vacations. The court&#39;s decision to order a 180-month prison term reflects the fact that Karlsson’s cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme is one of the largest to be sentenced to date and ensures that Karlsson now will have plenty of time to think about the harm he has caused to his victims.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/crypto-ponzi-scam-roger-nils-jonas-karlsson-doj-071142854.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1c2d4cee-9b5a-4e9b-81fc-36ca153997ee</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:11:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625814705</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T07:12:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/14893bf0-33d9-11eb-bf78-689d4ffd327a" width="6200" height="3200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/14893bf0-33d9-11eb-bf78-689d4ffd327a" width="6200" height="3200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[peterschreiber.media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Symbol in a digital raster microstructure - 3d illustration]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Digitized Bitcoin Symbol]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Square will build a bitcoin hardware wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Square has decided to go ahead with building a bitcoin hardware wallet and service, a month after company CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-173032873.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s considering the move.

In its decision, the board questioned Facebook’s internal policies and said the company should be more transparent about whether other key policies may have been “lost.”</p><p>The underlying case stems from an Instagram post about Abdullah Öcalan, in which the poster “encouraged readers to engage in conversation about Öcalan’s imprisonment and the inhumane nature of solitary confinement.” (As the board notes, Öcalan is a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Facebook has officially designated as a “dangerous organization.”)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook had initially removed the post, as Facebook users are barred from praising or showing support for dangerous organizations or individuals. However, Facebook also had “internal guidance” — created partially as a result of discussions around Öcalan’s imprisonment — that “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But that rule was not applied, even after the user’s initial appeal. Facebook told the board it had  “inadvertently not transferred” that part of its policy when it moved to a new review system in 2018.</p><p>Though Facebook had already admitted the error and reinstated the post, the board said it was “concerned” with how the case had been handled, and that “an important policy exception” had effectively fallen through the cracks for three years.</p><p>“The Board is concerned that Facebook lost specific guidance on an important policy exception for three years,” the group wrote. “Facebook’s policy of defaulting towards removing content showing ‘support’ for designated individuals, while keeping key exceptions hidden from the public, allowed this mistake to go unnoticed for an extended period. Facebook only learned that this policy was not being applied because of the user who decided to appeal the company’s decision to the Board.”</p><p>The board also chastised Facebook for not being transparent about how many other users may have been affected by the same issue. Facebook told the board it wasn’t “technically feasible” to determine how many other posts may have been mistakenly taken down. “Facebook’s actions in this case indicate that the company is failing to respect the right to remedy, contravening its Corporate Human Rights Policy,” the board said.</p><p>The case highlights how Facebook’s complex rules are often shaped by guidance that users can’t see, and how the Oversight Board has repeatedly challenged the company to make all its policies more clear to users.</p><p>Though it’s only taken up a handful of cases so far, the Oversight Board has repeatedly criticized Facebook for not following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>its own rules</ins></a>. “They can&#39;t just invent new unwritten rules when it suits them,” board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt told reporters after they said Facebook was wrong to impose an “indefinite” suspension on Donald Trump. The board has also criticized Facebook for not alerting users to key parts of its policies, such as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html"><ins>“satire exception.”</ins></a> It’s pushed the company to clarify its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> policies, and how it treats speech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>from politicians</ins></a> and other high-profile figures.</p><p>Facebook has 30 days to respond to the Oversight Board in this case, including several recommendations that it further clarify its “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations” policy and update its transparency reporting process.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-lost-rule-193222133.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5a236e6-3cfe-44a3-8d4f-a802a97e2127</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 19:32:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625772773</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T19:33:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

As <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/amazon-prime-video-imdb-tv-universal-licensing-deal-1234788103/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports, it&#39;s the first time Amazon has made such an agreement with a major US studio. The deal kicks in with Universal&#39;s 2022 slate of movies.</p><p>Here&#39;s where things might get a little confusing. The deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Earlier this week, Universal and its NBCUniversal sibling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/peacock">Peacock</a> reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">a similar agreement</a> for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for 10 months, then the films will go back to Peacock for at least another four months. Streaming rights can get pretty complicated!</p><p>The deal covers blockbusters such as <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out </em>director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>. Movies from Focus Features and Blumhouse are also part of the pact.</p><p>Netflix currently streams Universal&#39;s animated movies from Illumination and DreamWorks. According to <em>Deadline, </em>from next year onwards, Netflix might still stream the studio&#39;s animated releases for the 10 months of the pay-one window that they&#39;re not on Peacock. In any case, those films will hit Prime Video at a later date. Phew.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#39;s free streaming service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/imdb%20tv">IMDb TV</a> will hold exclusive streaming rights for 2020 and 2021 theatrical movies from Universal. The deal covers <em>The Invisible Man </em>and current box office champ <em>F9, </em>along with some older animated movies like <em>Despicable Me 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2</em> and <em>Shrek 2</em>.</p><p>The Prime Video deal follows a major agreement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-netflix-exclusive-deal-182221930.html">between Netflix and Sony Pictures</a>. Starting in 2022, Netflix will have exclusive rights to Sony&#39;s theatrical releases for the 18-month pay-one window. So, movies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-delayed-again-again-024721336.html"><em>Uncharted</em></a>, the <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> sequel and <em>Morbius </em>are all Netflix-bound.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1b8c4a75-370a-4272-a566-bf9a0133e977</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625769679</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T18:41:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LISA O'CONNOR via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Universal Studios globe fountain is pictured as season pass holders attend to the opening day in Los Angeles, California, on April 15, 2021. - Universal Studios Hollywood will reopen on April 16 following more than a year of closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The site says that the project, which will take between six and eight months to finish, will be formatted in 4K, with Dolby Vision HDR and a new Dolby Atmos soundtrack. David C. Fein, Mike Matessino and Daren R. Dochterman, who worked with Wise on the 2001 DVD version, will all return to work on the 4K spruce up.</p><p><em>The Motion Picture</em> (<em>TMP</em>)’s fraught production meant that the film was barely finished before it premiered, with Wise carrying the print himself to the premiere. Wise had said that the film was “unfinished,” and despite a healthy box office, took a pasting from critics who deemed it to be too slow and talky. At the dawn of the DVD era, Wise, Fein, Matessino and Dochterman collaborated on a re-edit of the film that better showed off Wise’s original vision. This included remastered visual effects and a remastered and re-edited score by Jerry Goldsmith. The effects for the 2001 version were produced by CGI pioneers Foundation Imaging, which was Star Trek’s (then) contractor for all computer generated work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="79819b7fd7064a83ae3367637e916e2a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbgqsaBZHUQ?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>(After its theatrical run, ABC broadcast a “Special Longer Version” of the film that is notorious for including extra scenes with clearly unfinished effects. The most obvious of which is the start of Kirk’s EVA, where the airlock set is surrounded by <a href="https://movies.trekcore.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=270&amp;pid=29519#top_display_media">studio scaffolding</a>, intended to be replaced by a matte painting.)</p><p>It was a well-held myth in fan circles that a 4K version of the <em>Director’s Edition</em> was impossible because the CGI assets and film footage had been scanned and edited for standard definition. The bankruptcy of Foundation Imaging, which took place shortly after the film was released, also dashed hopes for any higher-definition re-releases. However, as <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture#December_1977_.E2.80.93_December_1979:_Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture">Memory Alpha</a> lists, producer David C. Fein confirmed in 2017 that the digital material necessary to facilitate a 4K remastering still exists.</p><p>Given how<em> TMP’s</em> reputation has been slowly rehabilitated over the last three decades, a 4K version of the film is very welcome. If only because, as well as a smart and interesting vision of the future, the model work and score are so good that they deserve to be seen in the best possible resolution. We can’t wait to experience this in 4K when it arrives at some point between December and next March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-motion-picture-directors-edition-4k-remaster-paramount-plus-154117182.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">235684c6-b85f-4927-b7d2-75661fcbf293</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:41:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625758917</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T15:42:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DECEMBER 7:  Actors Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and William Shatner pose for a portrait with writer Gene Roddenberry and  director Robert Wise during the filming of the movie "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" which was released December 27, 1979 in the United States.

Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program (which is a bit like Microsoft&#39;s Windows Insider early-access scheme), it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>The snappily named Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders harnesses Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888 5G chipset</a> (but not the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a>). It has a 2.84 GHz octa-core processor and the Adreno 660 GPU. It has what Qualcomm describes as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E support with speeds of up to 3.6 Gbps. You&#39;ll get 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and 512GB of storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 6.78-inch AMOLED display from Samsung has a 144 Hz refresh rate, which could help make it a solid gaming phone. The screen has up to 1,200 nits of brightness and it&#39;s HDR10 and HDR10+ certified. The phone has three rear cameras: a 64MP main lens, 12MP ultrawide camera and 8MP telephoto. The array can capture video in up to 8K. The device also has a 24MP front camera and AI auto-zoom.</p><p>Qualcomm says this is one of the first phones to support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-wireless-audio-quality-160036734.html">Snapdragon Sound</a>, which has features including low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz.

In addition, the phone has dual SIM slots and it runs on stock <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2011">Android 11</a>.</p><p>The device draws from previous ASUS smartphones. It pulls from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG Phone 5&#39;s body design</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenfone-8-compact-flagship-flip-camera-price-availability-182205867.html">ZenFone 8 Flip&#39;s camera module</a>. Still, it&#39;s a showcase for Qualcomm&#39;s mobile tech. The company is facing some challenges on the mobile processor front, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-5g-iphone-chips-2023-kuo-080605379.html">many phone makers</a> working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">their own chips</a>. Showing off its knowhow with its own smartphone seems like a solid idea for Qualcomm. That way, it can perhaps remind people what it can do.</p><p>The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It&#39;ll arrive in India later. You&#39;ll be able to buy the $1,499 device at ASUSTeK’s eShop and other retailers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d079e9f-9ac1-4f23-a299-1ab2d2a46a68</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625763024</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T16:50:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter's extended NFL deal adds live Spaces chats with players]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has once again renewed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-30-twitter-expanded-programming-nfl-blizzcon.html">deal with the NFL</a>, and this time there&#39;s more than just video shows and Moments to keep football fans happy.

The two, along with whistleblower Daimler, supposedly agreed to avoid competing on emissions-reducing AdBlue urea injection tech in discussions held between 2009 and 2014.</p><p>BMW, Daimler and VW reached a deal on AdBlue tank sizes, ranges, and average consumption, and even shared &quot;sensitive&quot; technical details with each other, the Commission claimed. This reportedly halted competition and stopped the trio from realizing the &quot;full potential&quot; of their emissions-reducing tech.

To that end, officials offered guidance on cooperation that wouldn&#39;t run afoul of antitrust rules, such as developing a unified AdBlue software system.</p><p>That pioneering conclusion might cause problems, however. VW said in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-weighs-appeal-against-eu-fine-over-emissions-tech-collusion-2021-07-08/">statement</a> that it was considering a possible appeal against the fine for allegedly setting a dangerous precedent in unfamiliar territory. The automaker also maintained that the substance of the discussions was &quot;never implemented&quot; and that customers never suffered as a consequence. It&#39;s not certain VW would succeed with an appeal, but the fight could be far from over.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eu-fines-bmw-vw-over-diesel-emissions-tech-132924021.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b1533e3-5928-453f-80ff-dfd03a997f25</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 13:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625750967</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T13:29:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sean Gallup via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WOLFSBURG, GERMANY - OCTOBER 26: The Volkswagen logo is reflected in the window and body of a Volkswagen ID.3 electric car standingt on display at the Autostadt promotional facility next to the Volkswagen factory on October 26, 2020 in Wolfsburg, Germany.

The Amazon-owned retailer has an exclusive deal for Prime members that knocks $60 off the normal price of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AirPods Pro" href="https://fave.co/2TOBO9F">AirPods Pro</a> — and while that&#39;s not the cheapest we&#39;ve seen them (they hit $169 during Black Friday last year), it&#39;s still a solid sale for those that missed the previous opportunity.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy AirPods Pro at Woot - $190" href="https://fave.co/2TOBO9F">Buy AirPods Pro at Woot - $190</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> are nearly two years old at this point, they remain the best sounding earbuds that Apple makes. The Pros have a built-in amplifier and they use Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-frequencies to each wearer&#39;s ear. They also fit much better than standard AirPods thanks to their replaceable ear tips and they make decent workout earbuds thanks to their IPX4 water resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>We also appreciate the active noise-cancellation on the AirPods Pro — it&#39;s strong enough to block out the noises around you in your home or at the offie, and you can quickly jump into Transparency Mode when you need to participate in a conversation. And like other Apple headphones, the AirPods Pro use the embedded H1 chip to work seamlessly with Apple products. Those who primarily use iPhones, iPads and Mac computers will enjoy how easy it is to switch between taking a call with your AirPods Pro from your iPhone to listening to music from your MacBook Air.</p><p>In fact, we think the AirPods Pro are the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds for Apple lovers</a> — but there are a few out there that are better for sound and other features. If you&#39;re not a Prime member or simply aren&#39;t sold on the AirPods Pro, you could consider the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$150 Jabra Elite 75t" href="https://amzn.to/3hvodgR">$150 Jabra Elite 75t</a> or the new, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$280 Sony WF-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/2SUP5x4">$280 Sony WF-1000XM4</a>, both of which have good sound quality, excellent ANC and solid battery lives. But if you do go for Woot&#39;s deal, just remember that Woot may be owned by Amazon, but it has a totally different <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:return policy" href="https://fave.co/3hQFqju">return policy</a> that&#39;s more specific and less forgiving.
