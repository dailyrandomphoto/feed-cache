First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687492/discord-youtube-integration-watch-together-feature-beta">spotted by <em>The Verge</em></a>, the feature is only available to friends and family servers at the moment. However, the company reportedly plans to roll it out to the broader Discord community by the end of October. Users can add a video to the server queue either by searching directly through the included interface or pasting a link from YouTube.</p><p>Discord didn&#39;t have much to say about the test when we reached out to the company. &quot;As a company founded in innovation, we&#39;re always experimenting and building things we believe our users will enjoy,&quot; a Discord spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We don&#39;t have anything more to share right now, but stay tuned.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the integration comes just weeks after YouTube sent cease and desist letters to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/groovy-bot-discord-youtube-music-145236619.html">Groovy Bot and Rythm</a>, two of the most popular tools for playing music from YouTube, Spotify and other streaming services directly over Discord. The move forced both apps to shut down. As <em>The Verge</em> points out, the company tested a feature similar to Watch Together <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/">toward the start of the year</a>, but ended up shelving it temporarily before bringing it back this week. The company appears to have reprioritized development on the feature following the shutdown of Groovy Bot and Rythm.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/discord-tests-youtube-intergration-213416259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">788c5c35-8382-4aea-a85b-3ab095cdb6b1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 21:34:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632343781</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T20:49:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/321811f0-9c7f-11eb-bfff-f00a5ce15f9c" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/321811f0-9c7f-11eb-bfff-f00a5ce15f9c" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Discord app is seen on an iPhone in this photo illustration in Warsaw, Poland on April 3, 2021.

With over 9 million daily users Discord easily beats workplace messaging app Slack which attracted just over 2 million daily users at it's start.

He&#39;ll move to a part-time position as Facebook&#39;s first Senior Fellow at some point in 2022, when he&#39;ll help foster talent and improve the development process. The move will let Schroepfer spend more time with his family and philanthropy, according to the CTO&#39;s social post.</p><p>Hardware lead <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Andrew &quot;Boz&quot; Bosworth</a> will gradually replace Schroepfer as CTO in 2022. The departing executive made clear that his exit was voluntary — it was a &quot;difficult decision&quot; for someone still excited about Facebook&#39;s prospects, he said. Accordingly, company chief Mark Zuckerberg said Schroepfer played a &quot;critical role&quot; and was a &quot;close friend.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Schroepfer first joined Facebook in 2008 as a vice president of engineering. He took the CTO position in 2013.</p><p>Bosworth&#39;s ascension makes sense for a company increasingly focused on hardware like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">smart glasses</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">VR headsets</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html">Portal displays</a>. It&#39;s not without some controversy, however. The soon-to-be CTO has authored controversial internal memos in the past, including a 2016 memo seemingly justifying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-30-leaked-facebook-memo-ugly-truth.html">growth at any cost</a> and a 2020 write-up expressing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-facebook-leaked-boz-memo-trump.html">reluctance to fact-check politicians</a>. Boz later said he&#39;d changed his views in response to critiques, but he wasn&#39;t exactly known for sensitivity to privacy and misinformation issues in the past.</p><p>Whatever the new CTO&#39;s current stance might be, it won&#39;t be surprising if Facebook shifts its technology priorities. Zuckerberg added that a &quot;few other groups&quot; will join Bosworth as part of the transition, helping Facebook develop its metaverse. While the social media giant is already focusing much of its attention on virtual spaces, they might take an even higher priority under Boz.</p><div id="d9c4e8583b0b49ab82d3a0a938e103ce"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fschrep%2Fposts%2F10159715842464443&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" width="500" height="263" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cto-steps-down-2022-205051710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b934b90-4e3c-4f41-b191-ea92007d67cc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:50:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632345394</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T21:16:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Board & Management Changes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d1c03c60-1be5-11ec-b1b5-2c26965a1640" width="5208" height="3472" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d1c03c60-1be5-11ec-b1b5-2c26965a1640" width="5208" height="3472" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mike Schroepfer, Chief Technology Officer at Facebook speaks at the WSJTECH live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. October 21, 2019.

Lavatories, apparently. As <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ex-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmer-has-a-new-obsession-toilets/">notes</a>, the former Microsoft chief (and now LA Clippers owner) told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/09/20/steve-ballmer-clippers-intuit-arena/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and others that he has been obsessed with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-wants-your-help-designing-future-moon-toilets-130012151.html">toilets</a> at the Clippers&#39; upcoming stadium, the Intuit Dome. And yes, Ballmer declared &quot;toilets, toilets, toilets&quot; — when he repeats a word multiple times, you know he&#39;s serious.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t mean the toilets are about to run Windows or flush water in Microsoft colors. Rather, it&#39;s that the Intuit Dome will have an NBA-leading ratio of toilets (one for every 27 seats in the upper deck). Ballmer hates waiting in line for the washroom at a sports arena, and that high ratio will make sure you spend more watching the game than doing your business.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It won&#39;t surprise you to hear the Clippers used technology to solve that problem, however. The team used a computer model to estimate how long it would take a fan to use the washroom, grab food and return to their seat. That high toilet-to-fan ratio should help you get back in the space of a typical NBA timeout. Don&#39;t  laugh too loudly about Ballmer&#39;s toilet fixation, then, as you might just appreciate it when nature calls in the middle of a playoff game.</p><div id="3ffcf3212dfb4b84bafe90ea61ee20e9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZNI2ZztMFo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/steve-ballmer-toilet-obsession-203416276.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76d561eb-f166-4e7d-a512-c789cb840503</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:34:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632342858</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T20:34:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/780b4690-1bdd-11ec-b7fb-01946e5fb3d3" width="4974" height="3324" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/780b4690-1bdd-11ec-b7fb-01946e5fb3d3" width="4974" height="3324" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wally Skalij via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Los Angeles, CA.

While waiting for Robinhood to roll out the wallet feature to everyone, you can start using the recurring crypto investment tool it announced at the start of the month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-cryptocurrency-wallet-test-october-190030675.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d1ada68-6898-4733-bbb4-ce9655382859</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 19:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632337124</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T18:59:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5035fef0-1bd6-11ec-b7e5-a610838e0b98" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5035fef0-1bd6-11ec-b7e5-a610838e0b98" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robinhood]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Robinhood crypto wallet]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Robinhood crypto wallet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[You can nab a limited-edition Billie Eilish Echo Studio for $230]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After playing through some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beat-saber-billie-eilish-track-pack-now-availabile-201748499.html">Billie Eilish tracks in Beat Saber</a>, soon you&#39;ll also be able to kick back and listen to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:a limited-edition Echo Studio" href="https://amzn.to/3ABlklv">a limited-edition Echo Studio</a> sporting the cover of her latest album, &quot;Happier Than Ever.&quot; Beyond the beige fabric and Eilish&#39;s visage, the $230 speaker is no different than the standard $200 Echo Studio.

The presentation saw the company introduce new versions of mainstay devices like the Surface Pro and Surface Go, in addition to a handful of surprises. Here’s everything Microsoft showed off on Wednesday.</p><h2></h2><h2>Surface Duo 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ddbe05f0-1bc8-11ec-b5ff-1dac4d669bed" alt="Microsoft Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="8f9f2fa2-bc60-33bb-ab26-3faf09c1bd41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft announced a massive upgrade for its Surface Duo dual-screen Android device. Most notably, there’s an entirely new triple camera system on the back of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html">Surface Duo 2</a> that includes a telephoto lens and two wide-angle lenses. Another nifty new feature is an ambient screen on the device’s hinge to display your notifications and other information. With those upgrades, you can see Microsoft has started thinking of the $1,499.99 Surface Duo 2 as a more of a smartphone than a mere tablet. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-microsoft-surface-duo-2-surface-pro-8-surface-laptop-studio-surface-pro-x-surface-go-3-161010924.html">pre-order the Surface Duo 2 today</a> before it becomes officially available on October 21st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Surface Pro 8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b819d580-1bc9-11ec-a75f-a4f120ff3afe" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="f2150be9-ef85-31dc-a0ca-97d4b705a210"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>After several years of what felt like incremental updates, Microsoft’s Surface Pro line got a significant upgrade on Wednesday. To name just a few of the features found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html">Surface Pro 8</a>, it includes a 13-inch PixelSense display with a 120Hz refresh rate, support for Thunderbolt 4 (finally!) and faster internals courtesy of Intel’s latest 11th-generation processors. Oh, and Microsoft has also shaved down the Surface Pro’s notoriously chunky display bezels. The Surface Pro 8 will start at $1,100 and is available to pre-order today. It goes on sale on October 5th. That’s the same day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html">Windows 11</a> starts rolling out.</p><p>Alongside the Surface Pro 8, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-151216222.html">Slim Pen 2</a>. The $130 stylus includes a haptic motor Microsoft claims makes it feel like you’re putting pen to paper rather than glass. Another new accessory, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-adaptive-kit-accessibility-160002034.html">Surface Adaptive Kit</a>, bundles together a collection of add-ons that make it easier to find specific keys, locate ports and open your laptop or its kickstand. Lastly, the company made a mouse made from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ocean-plastic-mouse-recycled-materials-160014611.html">recycled ocean plastic</a>.</p><h2>Surface Pro X</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dec2c230-1bbc-11ec-b3f7-ef955f95edd0" alt="Surface Pro X" data-uuid="f64aefb0-75d2-33f3-b35a-fb98b08eba45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft didn’t update its ARM-based 2-in-1, but what it did do is introduce a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-wifi-only-899-usd-151558748.html">new WiFi-only</a> model that will save you $100 off the Surface Pro X’s previous $999 starting price. With the move to Windows 11, support for 64-bit software emulation is coming to the device. You can pre-order the new model today before it arrives in stores on October 5th.</p><h2>Surface Go 3</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/60495d80-1bc9-11ec-bff1-96d97cba35b2" alt="Surface Go 3" data-uuid="dae841a3-bcaa-3fe4-b8db-fe3a6acc77dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft’s smallest tablet got an appropriately minor update today. The company’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-release-date-specs-151539602.html">Surface Go 3</a> 2-in-1s feature faster processors from Intel. The base model comes with a Pentium Gold 6500Y CPU, up from the 4425Y in Go 2, while the more expensive variants feature 10th-generation Core i3 CPUs. Microsoft claims the latter chip is 60 percent faster than the Core m3 it previously offered with the Go 2. The entire Surface Go 3 family is available to pre-order today, with the base model starting at $400. Like all the other Surface computers Microsoft announced today, it goes on sale on October 5th.</p><h2>Surface Laptop Studio</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/12962910-1bc9-11ec-bb7a-0e64499fea18" alt="Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="ec688478-0043-30cf-a690-7ee84b64dedc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft<strong>&nbsp;</strong>saved its most interesting announcement for last. Enter the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-easel-hinge-153618416.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, a portable computer that borrows design cues from the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html">Surface Studio all-in-one</a>. An included hinge lets you pull the display over the keyboard to make inking and drawing more immersive. Microsoft also claims the Surface Studio is its most powerful notebook yet. The laptop features Intel’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-11th-gen-h-series-cpus-ultraportable-gaming-213018614.html">11th-generation H35 processors</a> and Intel Xe graphics. You can also configure it with NVIDIA’s RTX 3050 Ti GPU. The Surface Laptop Studio is available to pre-order today. It starts at $1,600 and will ship on October 5th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from </em>Microsoft&#39;s<em> fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2021-event-recap-185020522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf0d4c7d-f364-4fd5-bdc1-fde00ead2b4c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632336268</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T18:44:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da199890-1bd4-11ec-bfb7-cbe69cc8250d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da199890-1bd4-11ec-bfb7-cbe69cc8250d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[In-person TwitchCon events will return in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s still too early to tell what the COVID-19 situation will be like next summer, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> is hopeful it can bring streamers and fans back together in person in 2022.

Apple noted Sweeney said after the ruling that his company wouldn&#39;t give up an alternative payment system &quot;to get <em>Fortnite</em> back on iOS.&quot;</p><p>Following that comment and &quot;other statements since the court&#39;s decision, couple with Epic&#39;s duplicitous conduct in the past, Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic&#39;s developer program account at this time,&quot; the letter states.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, unless you stream the game to your iPhone from your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-remote-play-ios-230628909.html">Xbox</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html">PlayStation</a>, don&#39;t expect to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEaRI2Bjr-U">armored walls</a> in <em>Fortnite </em>on iOS any time in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa984c3-8b43-4fc4-903d-d4f84d6db5b1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:52:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632333163</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T17:52:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/ef28fc90-e23b-11ea-bd47-f9bfabb5acb6" width="7548" height="5032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/ef28fc90-e23b-11ea-bd47-f9bfabb5acb6" width="7548" height="5032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CHRIS DELMAS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[This illustration picture shows Epic Games' Fortnite loading on a smartphone in Los Angeles on August 14, 2020. - Apple and Google on August 13, 2020 pulled video game sensation Fortnite from their mobile app shops after its maker Epic Games released an update that dodges revenue sharing with the tech giants.

The edges of the device have one USB-C port, one power connector, a microSD card slot, a nano SIM slot and a headphone jack. In addition to the new Intel processors, the Go 3 runs on up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><h2><strong>Surface Pro X</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0caebfb0-1b08-11ec-bbf7-4acb5d8c88d3" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro X" data-uuid="55eeb3cc-606a-33e3-99df-6852d4a3661f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>The WiFi-only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro X" href="https://fave.co/3nWZMfz">Surface Pro X</a> is available for pre-order today and starts at $899.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3nWZMfz" id="d9e9130e25914545adaa9d6292ee9ea2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Pre-order Surface Pro X at Microsoft starting at $899</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html">Surface Pro X</a> isn&#39;t getting a big refresh or an upgraded model like some of Microsoft&#39;s other gadgets.

Refreshes of the Surface Pro and Surface Go aren’t surprising, and the company did show off the latest in both of those series. But the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop Studio" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">Surface Laptop Studio</a> is the most intriguing. It’s meant to replace the Surface Book, which was a detachable 2-in-1 laptop. The Laptop Studio, meanwhile, is more like Microsoft’s Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, in that it features a pull-forward screen that can lay flat on top of a table or be propped up at a slant. It also has a 120Hz display, as does the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro 8" href="https://fave.co/3kvnuNS">Surface Pro 8</a>, which got a sleek redesign.</p><p>I was able to check out the Laptop Studio, Surface Pro X and a slew of new Surface devices at a recent (COVID-safe) demo event in New York and I have to say, these Windows 11 PCs are looking very promising.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Surface Laptop Studio hands-on</h2><p>Let’s start with the Laptop Studio, which a Microsoft rep told me at the event will replace the Surface Book line. Like I mentioned, its new easel-style design is similar not only to its namesake <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html">Surface Studio</a>, but also to notebooks from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-acer-conceptd-7-ezel-pro-hands-on-price-specs-availability-conceptd-700.html">Acer </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-elite-folio-review-snapdragon-pc-180036528.html">HP</a>. I was very impressed with how thin the Laptop Studio’s 14.4-inch screen is, and it popped out of its frame without much force. The hinge connecting the display to the keyboard is sturdy, and kept the screen up at a variety of angles in laptop mode.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e3ef5a38-583a-4315-8a06-f4812710718c"/><p>When I flipped the screen to face outwards, though, I had trouble trying to push the lid away from me to get it to stand at a gentler angle as the panel popped out of the frame. But in every other configuration, such as a conventional laptop mode or laid down flat like a tablet (which Microsoft calls Studio mode), the Surface Laptop Studio behaved as expected.</p><p>When the screen is pulled forward and propped up in front of the keyboard in what the company calls Stage mode, it’s great for digital artists. It’s easier to draw on, and you can use the new Slim Pen 2 to create your masterpieces. The new stylus offers haptic feedback with an onboard motor and also mimics the resistance you’d get with pen on paper. I did feel a sort of drag across the Laptop Studio’s screen when I started doodling on it with the Slim Pen 2. It felt odd at first, as I’m accustomed to other styli like Samsung’s S Pen. But I got used to it quite quickly, and kind of liked feeling the mild vibrations that served as an indicator that something had been enabled.</p><p>The Laptop Studio has a magnetic strip under the keyboard that lets the Slim Pen 2 attach easily and remain flush with the rest of the machine. The magnets were strong enough that I only had to roughly place the stylus along the edge and it flipped into place. I don’t feel like I’d need to worry about losing the accessory with this setup, which is nice.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4f029cf0-1bb3-11ec-b666-e9d301aa0ff7" alt="Surface Laptop Studio hands-on" data-uuid="511e71fc-e3c4-38ea-9eda-f36022bfb834"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Microsoft also offers a 120Hz screen on the Laptop Studio, and a company representative told me at the demo that the touch sampling rate is 100Hz. This should make for a smooth drawing experience, but also make scrolling and animations look super buttery. There’s no adaptive refresh rate available in the system — you’ll just get the option to choose between 120Hz or 60Hz in settings.</p><p>For all the detailed specs on the Laptop Studio, like its new Full HD webcam, its screen resolution, dimensions, processor and memory configuration options, I encourage you to check out our news post. For this hands-on article, I’d like to focus on my initial impressions of the devices I got to try out.  On that note, the last thing I’ll say about my experience with the Laptop Studio is that its keyboard and trackpad were spacious, and though its buttons were cushy and responsive, I prefer the keys on the Surface Laptop 4. For things like battery life, performance and other real-world observations, though, we’ll need to wait till we can test out a review unit.</p><h2>Surface Pro 8 hands-on</h2><p>Another device that got a visual overhaul this year is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html">the Surface Pro 8</a>. It’s not the only new Surface Pro unveiled today — there’s also the Surface Pro 7 Plus, which received a typical minor processor upgrade and looks very similar to older Microsoft tablets. The Pro 8, meanwhile, looks a lot like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html">the ARM-based Pro X</a>. But it uses 11th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 chips and is therefore noticeably heavier. It also has a different ventilation design around its sides compared to the X, which was sealed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4711b270-1bb7-11ec-b79f-993ee91d37be" alt="Surface Pro 8 hands-on" data-uuid="f7e4c845-9d9b-3ccf-9c9c-5f0e5cc60764"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, the Pro 8 is impressively thin, with a 0.37-inch profile, and its built-in kickstand is even sharper. Its 13-inch screen is surrounded by an attractively thin bezel as opposed to the approximately inch-wide border around the Pro 7 Plus. The Pro 8 also features the same 120Hz refresh rate as the Laptop Studio, running at a 2,880 x 1,920 resolution.</p><p>Out of the box, though, the Pro 8 runs at 60Hz, and you can go into settings to bump this up to the higher rate. Meanwhile, the Laptop Studio refreshes at 120Hz by default. This difference is because the Pro 8 is designed to be a more portable device, and Microsoft expects people to want more battery life on the go. If your priority is smooth scrolling and inking (Slim Pen 2 is also supported here), then by all means go faster. But if you’re trying to squeeze every last minute out of the Pro 8, you might prefer to stick to the lower rate.</p><p>When you’re out of juice, you can charge the Pro 8 back up with Microsoft’s own connector or through one of the pair of USB-C ports. These support USB 4 and Thunderbolt 4, and can stream out up to two 4K displays at once. We weren’t able to test this during the limited time at our preview, and I can only really tell you that in general the Surface Pro 8 felt very much like a heavier Pro X. They use the same Signature Type Cover with the same comfortable keys and responsive trackpad, as well as onboard slot that holds and charges the Slim Pen 2.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5b7187c0-94ee-4876-984e-1e84a7bdfcee"/><p>Of all the other Surfaces Microsoft announced today — the Go 3, the new Pro X, the Pro 7 Plus and the Duo 2, only the last one is different in a significant way. The rest of the systems basically got incremental updates while maintaining a similar look to their predecessors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Surface Adaptive Kit</h2><p>I did want to call out the new Surface Adaptive Kit, though. It’s a set of labels and stickers that are designed to make Surfaces easier for people with different needs to use. There are translucent keycap labels to make buttons identifiable by touch, bump labels that add visual and tactile cues to keys or ports, as well as colorful indicators with matching cable wraps to make it more obvious which wires go into which sockets.&nbsp;</p><p>The colors I saw at the demo area were neon peach hued and I’m not sure if they’ll be appreciated by people with certain visual impairments (a pattern might be better for those who can’t distinguish between colors). But at least the keycap labels I saw came in different shapes and overall I appreciate the effort here.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="43255b30-fb2c-45ac-917d-4c234fb1e885"/><p>Microsoft led the way for accessibility tech in gaming with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-11-xbox-adaptive-controller-interview-ces.html">Xbox Adaptive Controller years ago</a> and though the Surface Adaptive Kit seems like a small product, it shows that the company is thinking in meaningful ways how to cater to people with different needs.</p><p>Though most of the new Surfaces that were unveiled today feel like incremental updates, the Laptop Studio, Duo 2 and Pro 8 at least bring a low-key level of excitement. Plus, these machines (Duo 2 aside) will all run Windows 11, which is already bringing new life to a stagnating PC industry. As always, we’ll need to test all these devices out for ourselves to see if they’re worth spending your money on, but you can already pre-order all of them today.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from </em>Microsoft&#39;s<em> fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-hands-on-surface-pro-8-pro-x-go-3-adaptive-kit-price-specs-160005455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ddd356e8-c1d6-41ed-b3ff-60e631158992</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:58:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632328082</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:28:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b71a2d50-1b5c-11ec-9fbf-107c359a08dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b71a2d50-1b5c-11ec-9fbf-107c359a08dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brian Oh / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft's 2021 lineup of Surface devices, including the Duo 2, Laptop Studio, Pro 8 and Go 3.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface event 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2 hands-on: Microsoft gets serious about its dual-screen phone’s cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e85d9e1e6d0c49e6a849de5347e0da55"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6p_lys1nMQ" title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>As we continue to wait for Microsoft to release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-surface-neo-duo-hands-on.html">the Surface Neo</a>, the company is already unveiling the second generation of its dual-screen Android phone. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/39tJy5e">Surface Duo 2</a> is a $1,500 device that’s slightly thinner than its predecessor and brings some serious camera improvements. Specifically, it now has three sensors instead of the lone 11-megapixel camera used in the last-gen setup. I had a chance to check out the Duo 2 briefly at a (COVID-safe) demo in New York, and I’m so far cautiously impressed by its updates.</p><p>Microsoft’s demo area wasn’t the best place to take memorable photos, but I did try out the Duo 2’s triple lenses on an Xbox controller. I easily switched from the main camera to the ultrawide and telephoto options, and also gave Portrait mode a go. I can’t judge the quality of these photos yet, since I could only view them on the Duo 2’s screens, but I already feel like the bugginess I experienced with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">the original Surface Duo</a> is mostly gone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That’s not surprising, since one of the biggest issues plaguing the Duo’s camera software was that it only had one camera that sat above the screen. You had to flip the phone so that the correct side was facing you when you wanted to take a selfie, and have the camera side face out for other shots. This meant the device needed to know which screen to activate based on how you were holding it.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1cb8d860-1b5c-11ec-bff4-42acc5d7ea95" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="df454000-727b-3023-b515-43c7354673f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>With the triple cameras sitting on the Duo 2’s back/outside and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera, there’s no longer a need to figure that out. It’s a shame, though: There’s also no longer a way to take photos without having the Duo 2 opened up; if you’re shooting with the rear cameras, you must use the device with both screens facing you.</p><p>The bulky camera bump also prevents you from flipping one of the screens all the way over to have both displays lay evenly back to back. I never really cared to do that with the original Duo since it was too wide to use as a makeshift phone, but it’s still disappointing that with this change, the Duo 2 will really mostly be used in Book mode. It’s no longer a phone-tablet hybrid.</p><p>I’m surprised at this functional shift, since one of the refinements Microsoft made with the Duo 2 is narrowing the device’s overall width. Each panel now measures 5.8 inches instead of 5.6 inches on the original, for a combined 8.3-inch screen as opposed to an 8.1-inch canvas. But they’re also taller, with resolutions of 1,344 x 1,892 instead of the older 1,350 x 1,800. This would have made the Duo 2 slightly more phone-like in shape, but in person I frankly couldn’t tell that it had changed in size at all.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/33322bf0-1b5c-11ec-b06f-eeb7741bd775" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="5d4d4c9f-6775-3d4c-948c-3d57c61e5a11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of, Microsoft claims that this is the thinnest 5G mobile device on the market. Indeed, at 5.5mm (or 0.21 inches) thick, the Duo 2 is certainly sleek. The company also introduced a slight curve on the inner edges of each screen — an effect that’s reminiscent of pages in an open book. This could potentially make it easier to drag apps across screens, which I was able to do quickly during my demo.</p><p>Another new feature that makes the Duo 2 feel faster than the original is its higher refresh rate. Both panels now run at 90Hz and are supposed to be in sync, too. I loaded up Engadget’s website and expanded it across the two displays, scrolling frenetically up and down on an article, and the two halves of the page did indeed keep pace with each other. I’m used to a 90Hz screen by now, thanks to long-term use of the Pixel 5, but it’s certainly a nice feature to see.</p><p>Microsoft also added support for its new Slim Pen 2, which offers haptic feedback so doodlers or artists can feel a vibration when they put the stylus to the screen. It also tries to mimic the feel and resistance of pen on paper, and I spent more time with this on the new Surface Laptop Studio than on the Duo 2.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47941130-1b5c-11ec-9ddf-126f74e2ecbc" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="2ba1e0c1-9bd1-3964-9c5e-1208e69b3e60"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Frankly, the fact that I encountered so few hiccups with the Duo 2 surprised me. The original Duo was riddled with bugs, and even simple things like expanding an app to span both displays were difficult. During my preview, this went smoothly. Admittedly, I didn’t spend much time with the Duo 2, so I’m still cautious about the seemingly improved software, but Microsoft has indeed been working on fixing past issues.</p><p>That responsiveness could also be attributed to the beefy Snapdragon 888 processor that powers the Duo 2, though we’ll have to perform real-world testing to be sure. We’ll also need to run our own battery test to see how long the Duo 2’s 4,449mAh cell lasts, as well as how successful Microsoft was at fixing the flaws of the original. I’m curious to see if the new triple camera system and the problems it introduces are a bane or boon to the Duo series, but for now I’m cautiously optimistic about the second Duo.

There was just no way to compete with other powerful notebooks when it required shoving full Windows PC, complete with a power-hungry CPU, into a large slate. Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop Studio" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, a new stab at building a powerful Surface notebook.</p><p>While it looks like a typical PC at first, a unique hinge allows you to pull the screen forward over the keyboard. And if you pull it all the way down, it turns into an easel, like a miniaturized version of the Surface Studio all-in-one. While I&#39;m sure some Microsoft fans may miss the sheer weirdness of the Surface Book&#39;s design, the Laptop Studio is clearly more functional for typical users. I&#39;ve yet to meet any Surface Book owners who actually use it in tablet mode very often — even flipping the screen around becomes a chore eventually.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1ce69a0-1bbe-11ec-bfda-8b9438708653" alt="Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="b66ffe94-36b2-3249-87a1-9e317ee48016"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>The Laptop Studio clearly has plenty of quirks of its own, too. Its lower half almost looks like two PCs stacked on top of each other, with an odd tiered design. And if its screen flexibility looks familiar, it may be because it takes a few cues from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-hp-spectre-folio-review.html">HP&#39;s leather-clad Folio</a>. That PC also let you pull out the screen and turn it into a tablet. It&#39;s a design I&#39;m surprised more computer makers haven&#39;t adopted, as it seems more genuinely useful than convertibles with screens that fold a full 360-degrees.</p><p>And just like the new Surface Pro 8, the Laptop Studio&#39;s 14.4-inch touchscreen is a step above most displays, thanks to its fast 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR support. Having a high refresh rate will make scrolling and just about any screen movement look smoother, but crucially it also makes scribbling with the Surface Slim Pen 2 more like writing on actual paper. The Laptop Studio also has a convenient storage and charging slot for that stylus below its screen (but of course, you&#39;ll have to buy it separately).</p><p>Surprisingly, Microsoft still held back a bit when it came to power. The Surface Laptop Studio features <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-11th-gen-h-series-cpus-ultraportable-gaming-213018614.html">Intel&#39;s quad-core 11th-gen H35 processors</a>, which were originally intended for ultraportable gaming notebooks. Those 35-watt chips will certainly be an upgrade over the Book 3&#39;s 10th-gen hardware, but you&#39;d think Microsoft would take this new model as a chance to spread its wings and cram in a six or eight-core CPU.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/adff9d00-1bba-11ec-b874-1edf94bcaacd" alt="Surface Studio Laptop" data-uuid="5bd82356-a7dc-3f03-8fa6-6cc6e774159c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>I&#39;d wager the company felt compelled to deliver something that was relatively light — the Core i5 Laptop Studio weighs 3.8 pounds, while the Core i7 model weighs 4 pounds. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t mind something a bit heavier if it meant fitting in a better processor. And it&#39;s not as if there aren&#39;t plenty of Surface options for people who care more about portability.</p><p>You&#39;ll get Intel Iris Xe graphics with the Core i5 Surface Laptop Studio, whereas the i7 model comes with NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti with 4GB of GDDR6 memory. We&#39;ve asked Microsoft to confirm the exact power usage of that GPU, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s the same 45-watt version that&#39;s in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-11th-gen-intel-xps-15-xps-17-110017302.html">Dell&#39;s new XPS 15</a>. From my testing, it&#39;s still faster than the Book 3&#39;s GTX 1660 Ti, but it would easily get smoked by a full-powered RTX 3050 Ti in a gaming system.</p><p>The Surface Laptop Studio starts at $1,600 and is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available for pre-order today" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">available for pre-order today</a>.

Middling hardware and consistently buggy software held back what could have been a compelling experience. But with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/39tJy5e">Surface Duo 2</a>, the company wants to change all that with a device that focuses on addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>Take one look at the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/09/22/introducing-new-surface-products-built-for-windows-11/">Surface Duo 2</a>, and you’ll notice it has a substantial camera bump. That might not seem like much of an upgrade, but it is because it means the Surface Duo 2 comes with a far more capable and versatile camera system than its predecessor. The original featured a single 11-megapixel above its right display. That meant you had to use that one camera for both selfies and regular shots. Add some imprecise software for switching between camera modes and the Surface Duo was never great at capturing snapshots.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2aa97400-1bbd-11ec-bbb7-51d05ee32c60" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="e278bac0-43ce-3f3c-9188-f0997fdba8cc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>With the addition of three new cameras, the Surface Duo 2 should at the very least allow you to capture a greater variety of shots. The triple rear camera array consists of a 12-megapixel wide-angle, a 12-megapixel telephoto and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide. The primary and telephoto cameras feature f/1.7 and f/2.4 aperture lenses, phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization.</p><p>Less noticeable, but welcome all the same, are the tweaks Microsoft has made to Duo’s signature dual PixelSense displays. The new model features slightly larger 5.8-inch AMOLED screens that combine into a single 8.3-inch display. They’re also brighter and feature a variable refresh rate of up to 90Hz for smoother scrolling.</p><p>Other notable features include a new sound system Microsoft says delivers stereo sound no matter how you hold or position the Surface Duo 2. On the side of the device, you’ll find a nifty ambient display that shows things like how much battery life you have. Oh, there’s also a new Obsidian black that is quite attractive, and you can attach a Surface Pen magnetically to the device.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/650f6780-1bbd-11ec-9fef-bdd7a591387d" alt="Surface Duo 2 " data-uuid="eacb8e70-a4eb-3f8b-91f5-38b9e4933dc1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Internally, the Surface Duo features a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888 processor</a> supported by 8GB of RAM. That’s a significant upgrade from the Snapdragon 855 the Surface Duo featured, which was already showing its age when the device came out in 2020. Moreover, with the move to Qualcomm’s latest silicon, the Surface Duo 2 adds 5G connectivity. In the US, Microsoft will sell a mmWave variant that will work with Verizon’s Ultra Wideband network. Powering everything is a 4,449mAh cell Microsoft claims provides all-day battery life. One thing to note is the Surface Duo 2 won’t come with a charger included in the box.

But it&#39;s easy to ignore how some of those changes can affect people with disabilities. Making a notebook thinner can <em>also</em> make it harder to open, for example. So to better equip its PCs to be more accessible, Microsoft created the Surface Adaptive Kit, a collection of add-ons that can help you find specific keys, locate ports and flip open your PC or kickstand.</p><p>While they may just look like a collection of simple stickers, it still shows that Microsoft is actually thinking of people with disabilities.

The tech firm has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/09/22/introducing-new-surface-products-built-for-windows-11/">unveiled</a> the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Go 3" href="https://fave.co/2W33BV3">Surface Go 3</a>, a performance-focused upgrade that brings faster chips to the 10.5-inch slate. The base model gets a relatively slight bump to a Pentium Gold 6500Y (up from a 4425Y in the Go 2), while the higher spec jumps from the Core m3 to a quad-core 10th-generation Core i3. You’ll get up to a 60 percent speed boost, Microsoft claimed. You’ll definitely want that quicker i3 if you juggle multiple apps.</p><div id="917963a9bd414051b876b2b416782de8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0f8Eo-tIA2o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Don’t expect a revolution otherwise, though. You’re still saddled with either 4GB or 8GB of RAM, and you’ll need to spring for the 128GB or 256GB SSD options if you want to avoid the pokey 64GB eMMC storage in the base Surface Go 3. You’ll have to be content with the 1,920 x 1,080 screen and lone USB-C port, too. Microsoft still includes a microSD slot and an option for LTE data, at least, and the 11 hours of claimed battery life (appropriate for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11</a> machine)  is still solid.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the prices are largely the same. The Surface Go 3 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:pre-order" href="https://fave.co/2W33BV3">pre-order</a> today ahead of its October 5th launch starting at $400 with the Pentium chip, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You’ll likely want to spend $630 for the jump to the Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD.  You’ll have to wait a while to buy LTE models that carry a $100 premium over their WiFi-only equivalents. And no, the keyboard cover ($100) and pen (starting at $100) aren’t included.</p><p>This update might be disappointing if you were hoping for an overhaul. It’s a speed bump for a design that hasn’t changed much since 2018, and the base version is still likely to be too slow for more than simple tasks. We wouldn’t rush to buy this incarnation if you already have a Surface Go — this is more for newcomers who prefer Microsoft’s tiniest Windows machine.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-release-date-specs-151539602.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">615dfa7e-dc8e-428f-91c5-8d3ce991ead6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:15:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632327425</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:17:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcee88f0-1bbe-11ec-bbfd-e83ba737b08d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcee88f0-1bbe-11ec-bbfd-e83ba737b08d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Go 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Go 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Slim Pen 2 offers paper-like haptic feedback]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a major Surface launch without a new pen, and Microsoft is happy to deliver.

It features a 13-inch PixelSense screen, a significant upgrade from the previous 12.3-inch display. Even better, it&#39;s one of the first non-gaming notebooks we&#39;ve seen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes scrolling through web pages and jotting down notes a lot smoother. And of course, it&#39;s built with Windows 11 in mind.</p><p>Together with some of Intel&#39;s latest 11th-gen processors, as well as long-awaited support for Thunderbolt 4, the Surface Pro 8 could tempt over potential buyers who were turned off by the limitations of previous models. As much as I&#39;ve liked <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-16-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-pc.html">earlier Surface Pros</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-usb-c-price-specs.html">last model made it clear </a>that Microsoft seriously needed to change things up.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6a400cc8-7df6-4e44-bbae-092f2beb5d5e"/><p>Personally, I&#39;m just glad to see those chunky Surface bezels fade away. Over the last decade, Dell, ASUS and most other PC makers have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-10-tech-borderless-screen-bezels.html">focused on shaving down borders to cram in larger displays</a>. Microsoft proved it could do that with the Surface Pro X, but that refined design has been absent from the standard Surface line until now. The new 13-inch edge-to-edge Pixelsense touchscreen is 11 percent larger, 12.5 percent brighter and sports a 10.8 percent higher resolution, according to Microsoft. There are still some noticeable bezels along the top and front of the Surface Pro 8, but at least they&#39;re not unsightly (and they could be useful for holding it in portrait mode).</p><p>The Surface Pro 8 is also a major step forward under the hood: It can be equipped with up to a quad-core Intel Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The LTE model caps out at 512GB of storage, but you&#39;ve also got the option of plugging in a 128GB or 256GB removable SSD at the bottom of the case. That&#39;s certainly a better option than the microSD card slot previous models had.</p><p>Microsoft claims the Surface Pro 8 is more than twice as fast as the Pro 7, something you can attribute both to that new Intel CPU and the improved Intel Xe graphics on the i5 and i7 models. You can expect 74  percent faster sustained graphics performance, as well as 40 percent better sustained CPU performance. Of course, we&#39;ll have to run our own benchmarks to confirm those figures.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9aded532-1bb8-11ec-bd69-e3bdc4ebf985" alt="Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="42f3e1c8-f287-39b5-9257-e416f3306ee7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Thankfully, the Surface Pro 8 finally supports Thunderbolt 4 on its two USB-C ports. That means you&#39;ll be able to connect fast external hard drives, several 4K external monitors or even an external GPU. As for other updates, the rear camera is now 10MP instead of 8MP, and it also supports 4K video. The front-facing camera is still 5MP with 1080p video, but it should offer better low-light performance. As for battery life, Microsoft says the Pro 8 should last up to 16 hours, a leap ahead of the estimated 10.5 on the Pro 7. You&#39;ll also be able to charge it up to 80 percent in over an hour.</p><p>While it&#39;s not a huge step up, I&#39;ll be interested to see how well the new Surface Slim Pen 2 works on the Pro 8&#39;s 120Hz screen. Microsoft&#39;s tablets have always offered some of the best digital inking around, but a faster screen should make jotting down notes feel even more like putting pen to paper. The Slim Pen 2 also features a haptic motor for realistic feedback, and it can be seamlessly tucked (and charged) in the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard.</p><p>And no, Microsoft still isn&#39;t bundling any of its keyboard covers with the Surface Pro 8. The new tablet is also slightly heavier than the Pro 7, clocking in at 1.96 pounds instead of 1.7. That may seem like a marginal difference, but it&#39;s something you&#39;ll feel in your wrist if you&#39;re actually using it as a tablet.</p><p>With a larger and more responsive screen, as well as more power, the Surface Pro 8 could be a serious competitor with ultraportables like Dell&#39;s XPS 13. We&#39;ve also seen other PC makers attempt to make hybrid devices like the Surface, but none of them have surpassed Microsoft&#39;s hardware.  Perhaps now, with even better hardware and a shiny new OS, Microsoft can finally convince more people to take a chance on the Surface Pro.</p><p>The Surface Pro 8 will start at $1,100 and is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available to pre-order today" href="https://fave.co/3kvnuNS">available to pre-order today</a>. It&#39;ll be on sale with the rest of the Surface lineup on Windows 11&#39;s launch date, October 5th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a0bc996-6412-47dc-bf53-6f8f6aa2348c</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:09:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632327454</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fa1c650-1bb7-11ec-a9e7-09a81d06a250" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fa1c650-1bb7-11ec-a9e7-09a81d06a250" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surface Pro 8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Surface Pro 8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon workers fired for cannabis use can reapply for jobs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html">looser stance on workers&#39; marijuana use</a> now covers people who were previously dismissed.
