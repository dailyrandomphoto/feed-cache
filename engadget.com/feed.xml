To start, the company is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en">testing</a> the option of adding multiple audio tracks to videos. This will help with international viewers, of course, but it should also enable descriptive audio for people with little to no vision. This arrives sometime in the &quot;coming quarters,&quot; YouTube said.</p><p>Automatic captions should also be far more commonplace. YouTube now permits live automatic captions for any livestream in English, not just those with 1,000 or more subscribers. These live captions will be available for all 13 supported auto-captioning languages in the &quot;coming months,&quot; according to the company. Auto-translated captions will also reach supported languages on Android and iOS later in 2021, so you won&#39;t have to turn to your PC to make sense of a video you don&#39;t understand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An experiment later in 2021 will let you search transcripts on your phone, YouTube added.

YouTube is increasingly dependent on a global audience for views, particularly with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">growth of livestreaming</a>.

Following cancellations in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-geneva-motor-show-canceled-over-coronavirus-fears.html">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/geneva-motor-show-canceled-2021-215213497.html">2021</a>, the trade show was supposed to return on February 19th, 2022, but that’s no longer happening.

Pre-pandemic, it was one of the largest car shows in the world. It would usually attract more than 600,000 visitors, including some 10,000 journalists, to Swizterland. Beyond its sheer size and scale, the show was particularly known for all the new and wild concepts cars that would debut on its floor.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2022-geneva-international-motor-show-canceled-190522942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e998ffa0-6d0f-466c-8db5-9e43c3d6b8d2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 19:05:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633632935</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T18:55:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/a54b25b0-4057-11eb-aef7-1a77deddb0c1" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/a54b25b0-4057-11eb-aef7-1a77deddb0c1" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pierre Albouy / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The new Bugatti La Voiture Noire is displayed at the 89th Geneva International Motor Show in Geneva, Switzerland March 5, 2019.

The Square Enix-owned studio has <a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/news/eidos-montreal-and-eidos-sherbrooke-shifting-to-the-4-day-work-week/">announced</a> that its Quebec locations (Montreal and Sherbrooke) are shifting to a four-day, Monday-to-Thursday work week sometime in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot; Salaries and working conditions will remain the same, the <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Tomb Raider</em> developer said.</p><p>The hope, as you might expect, is to improve the quality of working hours. Eidos is accordingly encouraging teams to redefine work conditions and improve efficiency, such as by cutting meeting times. The company had already implemented some quality-of-life changes during the pandemic, such as rest periods and compensation for mental and physical health costs — this is ostensibly a logical extension of that strategy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Eidos isn&#39;t the first studio to adopt a four-day week. <em>Bugsnax</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bugsnax-octodad-young-horses-ps5-indie-interview-201014684.html">Young Horses</a> made that switch in September. It&#39;s very rare for a large studio to make this move, though, and it might prompt similar moves by other developers if the strategy proves successful.</p><p>&quot;If&quot; is the operative term, however. Eidos was eager to tout past tests with shortened work weeks, like with Iceland&#39;s civil service, but it&#39;s not yet clear if that translates to the game industry. Developers are notorious for rushing games to make the holiday season, even if that leads to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-08-ubisoft-patch-4-will-fix-most-assassins-creed-unity-bugs.html">extremely buggy results</a>.  Eidos will have to make a hard choice: does it stick to the four-day schedule and risk delaying games, or demand extra hours to be sure a title is ready? This shortened week could pay off with happier developers, but it could also cause problems if teams take months more to finish projects.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eidos-montreal-sherbrooke-4-day-work-week-184509137.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">215385d2-3aa7-4d8a-9c84-13bf0d83f871</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 18:45:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633632313</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T18:45:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FREDERIC J.

When YouTube returned with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-youtube-rewind-2019-video.html">Rewind 2019</a>, it abdicated editorial control and let the statistics guide the content to the frustration of viewers.

Writer and director Johannes Roberts (<em>47 Meters Down</em>) indicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-movie-reboot-labor-day-weekend-181507669.html">earlier this year</a> that he was taking things back to the franchise&#39;s horror roots and the trailer offers some positive signs that he&#39;s achieved his goal.</p><div id="4835e48fc5dd45a397c2d100433b312f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q6UGCyHZCI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The film is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-movie-reboot-labor-day-weekend-181507669.html">based on the first two games</a> in the classic series and it&#39;s a complete reset following the six (6) Paul W.S. Anderson movies. In case there was any ambiguity about Roberts starting over, the trailer&#39;s opening voiceover puts that firmly to bed. &quot;Every story has a beginning,&quot; one character, perhaps Claire Redfield, says. &quot;Discover the origin of evil.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em> is set in 1998, and we see the first game&#39;s creepy mansion as well as some of the city where the sequel takes place. The trailer hits a lot of the right beats and it includes some memorable moments from the games. There&#39;s a nod to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vn9grrIZ7E">opening scene of <em>Resident Evil 2</em></a>, in which an infected truck driver plows his tanker into Raccoon City. Despite a couple of iffy CGI shots, there&#39;s some solid creature design too, including zombie dogs and even a licker. Add in some jump scares, and it&#39;s a promising first look.</p><p>If you&#39;re craving more Resident Evil until the movie arrives, you can check out a virtual-reality version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-virtual-reality-remake-oculus-quest-release-date-170905892.html"><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>on Oculus Quest 2</a> later this month.

The company even got into the furniture game with what is possibly the <a href="https://output.com/products/platform">sexiest studio desk for under $1,000</a>. But its undeniable flagship is <a href="https://output.com/products/arcade">Arcade</a>, a subscription-based sample mangler that’s constantly serving up new sounds to mess with. Today the company is launching <a href="https://output.com/blog/arcade-note-kits-walkthrough">version 2.0</a> that includes a number of upgrades, but the biggest is the addition of “Note Kits” — which are simply playable chromatic instruments.</p><div id="85b0d70c8b6c40cb9d3a836e84b8c9f1"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/PsNiovo" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the original version of Arcade you had what are now called Sampler Kits. Here you get 15 samples laid out across a keyboard on the white keys, while the black keys resequence, stretch, reverse or stutter the sounds. But Note Kits are just like any other soft synth, and the keyboard is just a keyboard so you can use Arcade to play melodies and chords more traditionally.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the main UI you’ll now find recommended Note Kits as well as Sampler Kits, and each line of sound packs is neatly divided into two, with sections for each. The main interface for the Note Kits isn’t much different than the Sampler Kits. There’s a keyboard at the bottom of the screen and four macro controls in the middle for modifying a sound and adding effects (though, they often use vague terms like space and breath).</p><p>The core conceit of Arcades — to be as approachable as possible — hasn’t changed either. Those four macros offer a good amount of control for shaping of your sound. But, if you really want to get detailed you can click the “tweak” button at the top. Here is where you’ll find the heart of Arcade’s synth engine. Similar to Kontakt Arcade is sample based. You can combine up to three different sounds then choose start, end and loop points. There are also separate amp, pitch and filter envelopes for each sample; a multimode filter with two different high- and low-pass options as well as drive; a modulation section with an ADSR envelope, an LFO and two 32-step sequencers; plus a number of built in effects like reverb, delay and chorus.</p><div id="b1bd249d08ea47cb83e20b33c8d2fc37"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0hzAuT3" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Despite the fairly comprehensive set of sound design tools, Arcade is incredibly simple to use. While the interface pushes you to simply download a preset and start making music, it’s very easy to start creating unique instruments of your own. The one issue is that, while you can start from scratch to build your own note kit, it’s not prominently featured in the UI. And, as far as I can tell, there’s no way to import your own sounds to a Note Kit, only a Sampler.</p><p>The custom kit creator for samples has gotten a serious upgrade for version 2.0, though. The Kit Generator takes any sound from your own personal collection — whether you recorded it yourself or downloaded it from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splice-new-creator-plans-with-exclusive-plugins-and-educational-videos-123418413.html">Splice</a> — and then using AI spits out multiple variations, and pairs it with effects for further manipulation.</p><p>My one minor complaint is that you can&#39;t tweak the sample variations until after you&#39;ve saved the automatically generated kit as a preset. All you can do is select what predetermined set of effects macros you want to pair with it. And if you&#39;re not happy with the results, it doesn&#39;t appear you can delete custom kits. Only remove ones you&#39;ve downloaded from Output.</p><p>The app has gotten a mild facelift too, with better visual feedback and simplified navigation. Though, a single view for all the Kits you&#39;ve downloaded would be handy.</p><p>The combination of instant results and decently deep sound design tools makes Arcade incredibly fun to use. It doesn’t necessarily make sounds that other instruments or even your DAW’s stock plugins aren’t capable of. But it’s less tedious.</p><p>You can try Arcade 2.0 for free for 30 days, after which it’s $10 a month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcade-20-note-kits-instruments-sampler-hands-on-161548233.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cff0bbfe-84de-441d-9ec3-699bee7a9156</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 16:15:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633623827</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T16:24:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c5e9d30-2786-11ec-9f57-a3573d555084" width="1968" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c5e9d30-2786-11ec-9f57-a3573d555084" width="1968" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Output]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Output Arcade 2.0]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Output Arcade 2.0]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft made a translucent controller for the Xbox's 20th birthday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On November 15th, 2001, Microsoft released the original Xbox, in the process, it changed the console landscape forever.

A nifty touch here is that Microsoft made the internal components silver to make them easier to see. The brand’s signature green color is used for accent details, including the rear grips. Outside of those visual flourishes, it’s functionally the same as any other Xbox Wireless controller you can buy from Microsoft.

Many preterm babies require a NICU stay, with the average length being <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/pdfdocs/nicu_summary_final.pdf">13.5 days</a>. Though I had little idea of what I was doing when I brought home my twins from the NICU, I did know that I was going to continue to monitor their vitals stats using an Owlet sock. My partner and I had become accustomed to checking their heart rate and pulse ox levels on a hospital monitor, and being able to get that information at home helped us build confidence in our role as non-professional caretakers to two very tiny humans.</p><p>In both the NICU and online parenting forums, multiple people recommended the Owlet. It’s specifically these fans the brand was responding to with the recent release of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$359 Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">$359 Smart Sock Plus</a>, a larger sock with an updated algorithm that can be used on children up to five years old or 55 pounds. That’s a decent leap from the previous 18-month/30-pound cut-off that my kids just passed. The company claims that 72 percent of the parents it polled said they’d like to use their Smart Socks for longer, and that certainly included me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The third-generation Owlet monitoring system featured a redesigned “butterfly” style sensor that fit into an updated fabric sock, and it’s more of the same with the Plus. You’ll find the same removable sensor with a protruding button that attaches to the Base Station for wireless charging when not in use, along with the same winged, Velcro attachments for switching it between socks.</p><p>It’s also still lightweight, easy to remove and replace, and fast charging. Owlet says a full charge takes an hour and a half, and you can get eight hours worth of use with only 20 minutes of charging. That bore out in testing when I was able to grab a full night&#39;s worth of battery life in the time it took to finish our bedtime routine with the kids. The compact, more subtle Base Station is also the same as the one found on the smaller smart sock model.</p><p>The new sock has a similar construction, too, including a soft, flexible fabric strip that fastens around the ball of the foot to keep the sensor at the outside of the little toe. And there’s  an ankle band to secure the whole thing in place. The Smart Sock Plus comes with the same four initial sock sizes: left and right for under 12 pounds; and left and right for 12 to 30 pounds; plus an expansion pack of left and right socks for 30 to 55 pounds. It’s worth noting that currently the Smart Sock Plus is only available in the classic Mint Green shade, and not the Deep Sea Green or Dusty Rose colors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d2840f0-26e5-11ec-bfda-eec8beb8a019" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus" data-uuid="1e774dc4-1cd5-3a0d-9aed-03c810c5f7bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I had issues with the fit on the last sock, and was pleased to find that the Plus version for larger kids (30-plus-pound) seemed less prone to unintentional slippage. I say unintentional because my kids have just learned to work Velcro so they can, very purposefully, take the sock off. While they were proud of themselves for their accomplishment, this underscores the challenge in offering a sock for older children: It might be a fight to get them to keep it on.</p><p>One of the user reviews I read for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:original Owlet sock" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">original Owlet sock</a> recommended putting a regular sock on over the smart one to keep it from sliding around. I tried that and found that it worked well for my son, but less so with my daughter who has better dexterity. That’s unlikely to solve the issue for the length of the sensor’s life, though I’d expect older children can be taught to wear the sock to sleep. I asked Owlet what they recommend to keep the sock in place in these instances, and they, too, suggest using a regular sock or footie pajamas. They also claim some parents wait until their kids are asleep to put the Smart Sock on, but those folks are braver than I.</p><p>Because the sock fits better, I had fewer disconnection error alerts. In fact, the only time I received alerts due to a misaligned sock were times when my kids had actually removed it. Given that frequent unexplained alerts were one of my pain points with the last version, it was nice to see that had improved. I got consistent readings when they were in fabric socks or footie pajamas, and also when they were under a blanket. What’s more, I had no problem keeping the Base Station in my office, next door to my kid’s room; it was still easily able to keep everything connected.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4cd18a0-26e5-11ec-bd7a-14ebc24f1380" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus worn underneath a fabric sock" data-uuid="48051c2e-33bc-3d6a-bc01-66dfdae06a41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I will say that the sock still seemed to run out of battery quicker than the second-generation one did, but it was comparable to the third gen. While the sock could reliably make it through an  evening of monitoring (roughly 7pm to 7am), I occasionally saw low-battery warnings in the morning. However, these warnings indicated that I had less than four hours of runtime, which seems like plenty of time.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Every time I set up an Owlet device, I hit a snag. This time, instead of connecting to the Owlet in my WiFi settings, I was instructed to go through the Privacy settings and toggle on the Local Network option. But the Owlet app kept telling me to check the permissions, even after I’d turned them on. And off. And on again. And closed and restarted the app.</p><p>Although this is the first time I had to call Owlet support for a resolution, I was able to easily get through to a live person and resolve the problem in a little over five minutes (thanks again, Jill!). I haven’t had any problems since.</p><p>As with the rest of the Plus experience, the app remains largely unchanged. The difference here are the updated algorithms that Owlet is using to calculate data for kids in the 18-month to five-year range. Because the sock can now fit more kids, the algorithm has to accommodate for physical changes over time. Owlet says a good example is heart rate, which changes as a child gets older.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8d630690-26eb-11ec-997e-18c73b9bd37e" alt="Owlet app" data-uuid="1139dd9f-b84b-342a-b97c-6075c0f65bd4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>Aside from that, you still get a dashboard to access each child’s profile, which contains their live heart rate and pulse ox data, the battery life of the sock and WiFi connection status. If you’re also using the Owlet Cam as a video monitor, you’ll see the feed here. Previous days’ data can be found under History, which includes an overview and info graphs. This has always been one of the most useful portions of the app for me, as it showed me the trends on when my twins were — and were not — doing well sleeping.</p><p>As I mentioned, I haven’t yet had any false alerts, though I’m not sure what to chalk that up to — faster internet at my new house? A better fit on the sock? Upgraded algorithms? Either way, it’s nice to report on a better experience, especially given the price difference between the $359 Plus and the $299 third-gen sock.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>There aren’t a ton of products out there similar to Owlet’s sock. The company has seemingly cornered the market on baby wearables that measure pulse ox and heart rate, but there are a few other noteworthy devices in this space. One of them is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nanit system" href="https://amzn.to/3CVwm5O">Nanit system</a>, which pairs a camera with an item of the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Breathing Wear clothing" href="https://amzn.to/3F25X8v">Breathing Wear clothing</a> to monitor respiration and sleep as well as provide a video feed. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3ieFquT">Complete Monitoring System</a>, which includes app subscription extras like two days of video history, comes in at  $379. In testing, the Breathing Wear worked as advertised and the camera offered an impressively clear 1080p HD feed. I’ve also used the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pampers Lumi" href="https://amzn.to/3kPgHPn">Pampers Lumi</a>, a solid $187 camera-slash-wearable that only tracks diaper changes and sleep patterns. However, it looks like the sensor is hard to come by right now — we&#39;ve reached out to Pampers to see if the Lumi sensor and companion diapers are still widely available.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4b61890-26e8-11ec-bba7-7ffff1e21273" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus " data-uuid="b48176e5-aa57-3873-9e72-d217e16b5df3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">Owlet Smart Sock Plus</a> fills a need for people who are already on the Owlet bandwagon: It allows parents to continue using a product they like and are comfortable with for a longer period of time. Other than better algorithms and a larger sock, there’s not much difference between the Plus and the third-gen device — which was absolutely an improvement over the version that came before it. I’d expect the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$69 expansion pack" href="https://fave.co/3kOe1ld">$69 expansion pack</a> to sell well, as it provides what current customers will need to upgrade to the next sock level, but  $359 is a high barrier to entry for a baby monitoring system that may not work for your sleep routine. That said, if you’re an Owlet customer who is happy with your current smart sock, it’s unlikely you’ll regret snagging an expansion pack when your kiddo has gotten big enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/owlet-smart-sock-plus-review-130525360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">806c6f42-64a7-4aae-808d-b302965efc16</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:05:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608665</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:11:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f976d590-26ba-11ec-b1fc-ad705d650fee" width="8192" height="6719" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d93c9470-fab6-11eb-9efb-f01f4b675e7f" width="2000" height="1429" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Owlet / Weston Colton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ is ready to let its ensign heroes rank up]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains minor spoilers for season two, episode nine of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>Throughout the history of Star Trek, it’s generally accepted that a member of Starfleet will spend about three years as an <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ensign">ensign</a>, the lowest officer rank in the fleet. It’s the position given to new Starfleet Academy graduates, and the status of the four protagonists on <em>Lower Decks</em>. However, as the show wraps up its second season and prepares for a third, it does bring the character’s status as “lowly ensigns” into doubt. This week’s episode touches on, though doesn’t solve, the problem by exploring the universal concept of a “lower decker.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In “wej Duj” (the first full Klingon language episode title in the entire franchise), the <em>USS Cerritos</em> is in transit between missions, giving the crew some much-needed downtime. Mariner, Rutherford and Tendi use their day off to spend some personal time with senior officers, which sends the bridge-crew-friendless Boimler into a panic since he notes that this will give them an edge when it comes to getting promoted. He spends most of the episode trying and failing to get buddy-buddy with various officers. If this all feels like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html">C-plot level shenanigans</a>, well, it is. But as a result the show takes its biggest leap yet to fill out its narrative in this episode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fccecba0-26e5-11ec-af3f-142af226e5b9" data-uuid="c870b61f-e18d-308c-b2dd-d09724f9a5b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>“wej Duj” is Klingon for “three ships,” and we get to see the crew of the Klingon vessel <em>Che’Ta</em>, where a very ambitious Boimler-esque Klingon is trying to get in good with the current captain of his ship. Old school fans will remember that authority on Klingon ships is assigned by force, with an officer assuming command by killing the previous captain. This young Klingon isn’t quite that ambitious, but he’s perfectly happy to walk the captain’s pet targ if it helps him become first officer.</p><p>The episode also shows us the happenings on a nearby Vulcan craft called <em>Sh’Vhal</em>, where a lower decker named T’Lin there has been messing with the sensors and as a result, notices some strange readings in the area that she takes to the captain to investigate. The captain agrees to the search, but he also reprimands her for undertaking such unnecessary adjustments to the ship.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3ef8d070-26e6-11ec-b7d7-4006d6c0b2a0" data-uuid="83281cc2-9a0b-3a77-bc54-8b6b2b7b4b33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>The entire episode could have been played as a “slice of life,” with the three plot lines never intersecting and it still would have been a fairly successful installment of the series. This isn’t our first look at the internal life of a Klingon ship, but it is our first look at a Vulcan crew, and playing those distinct societies against Starfleet culture is a great bit of world building. Star Trek has never been good about showing life outside Starfleet, only lightly touching on the grander world in more recent shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/picard"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20prodigy"><em>Prodigy</em></a>. And even those still have tenuous Starfleet connections. <em>Lower Decks</em> has relished showing us the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">larger universe</a> that the characters exist in, and here we now get that same sense of expansion without the Starfleet worldview intruding.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the storylines stand apart, far from it. All three ships and their plot lines come together in the end, not only pulling the episode into one cohesive narrative, but also continuing — and starting to resolve — a plot line that has lingered since the end of season one, namely the Pakleds. We finally find out why they suddenly became a huge threat in the Alpha Quadrant, thanks to a series of machinations reminiscent of storylines on <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. Not everything is revolved by the end, presumably leading into a big finale next week. It’s fair to say that seasons one and two basically comprise one full story arc, with season three possibly presenting a fresh slate.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2f76380-26e6-11ec-9fbf-c762142a472a" data-uuid="99aeaad1-776e-3fa9-bced-dcee5da97be3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>And it’s just in time, too. Each season has represented a year on the <em>Cerritos</em>. Next season will mark three years on the Cerritos for Boimler, Tendi and Rutherford, placing them in line for a promotion. And unlike Mariner’s purposeful self-sabotage, her friends have all shown themselves to be competent, trustworthy officers. There’s no reason they shouldn’t be promoted — and technically Brad Boimler already was at the end of last season, having only been demoted and sent back to the <em>Cerritos</em> because of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html">transporter accident on the USS Titan</a>.</p><p>While it’s unlikely (though not impossible) that the characters will get promoted in the season finale, it will have to happen some time next year for the show to maintain its verisimilitude in Star Trek canon. The <em>Cerritos</em> doesn’t have the luxury of being trapped in the Delta Quadrant as an excuse to keep its ensign an ensign (poor Harry Kim). But there’s hope, given what happens to our Klingon and Vulcan lower deckers by the end of “wej Duj.” Those outcomes, alongside the episode wrapping on Brad giving sage advice to a young crewman, seem to hint that the show is comfortable with letting our protagonists move on when it’s time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-nine-130037874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3f13522-630f-43aa-b90c-1787ccabfa00</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633563475</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T23:38:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["wej Duj" Ep# 209 -- Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner,  Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford,  and Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

It’s like a “greatest hits” of the series so far, with room for future adventures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-eight-disney-plus-120027634.html">last episode’s altercation</a>, the Watcher knows he cannot handle Infinity Ultron by himself, instead enlisting the help of the heroes we’ve met over the entire season, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html">Captain Carter</a>, T’Challa Starlord and Party Thor. The one exception is a Gamora who appears to have been working with Tony Stark, pulled into the group with little explanation, making me wonder if I had missed an episode. (Though the Watcher’s dismissal of Tony was pretty funny.)</p><div id="b175abecf6e74239b9473dbe3d59cffc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CjiHZ95Hh6k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Where other episodes have had to rush through their premises, showing us how those particular realities differed from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe, the finale has eight prior episodes to lean on for background so it got straight to the action. What we got was a tight, zippy episode that’s sure to be a crowd-pleaser, with lots of fun banter between the characters. And it certainly helped that a few were played by their original live-action actors, most notably Benedict Cumberbatch and Hayley Atwell.</p><p>However, even this episode left some loose ends and a lot of doors open, with Arnim Zola and Killmonger locked in eternal battle, Black Widow finding a new team and Captain Carter discovering her lost-long love still alive. These all feel ripe for sequels that this show appears more than willing to deliver.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d4cb5b0-26e1-11ec-b37f-879c5916558b" style="height:872;width:1920;" alt="Captain Carter" data-uuid="f4ca54f6-e6be-3d48-ab65-9606339f3892"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It raises the question of what <em>What If…?</em> actually is. The show was originally presented as an anthology — which is still one of the tags it’s given on Disney+. Traditionally an anthology is a collection of stories or essays by different authors, but as early as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20twilight%20zone"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a> television has defined an anthology as a program with new characters and scenarios every episode, regardless of whether the writers are the same. Even now, while every episode of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/black%20mirror"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> is written by Charlie Brooker, you’ll still see it described as a science fiction anthology.</p><p>The episodes of <em>What If…?</em> are written by a variety of people including showrunner A.C. Bradley, but that’s par for the course with any television program, even the serialized ones. But its anthology nature was due to the fact that even if they were similar to characters we already knew and loved from the live-action productions, the characters were still different people. This is actually alluded to in the finale, when Gamora’s machine fails to destroy the Infinity Stones because it was only built to crush the gems in her universe, not in all realities.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95cc3280-26e0-11ec-a4ef-3ae3307af144" style="height:868;width:1869;" alt="T&#39;Challa, Gamora, Killmonger, Thor" data-uuid="178900c9-1e31-396f-8d4a-15530953ff2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But ultimately, even if it’s different universes, it’s one multiverse and thus, one continuity. To watch this finale you would have needed to see every episode of the series this season, instead of cherry-picking only the episodes you were interested in. I know a few people who were only watching the concepts that intrigued them, but in the end they’ll have to watch every episode in order to make sense of certain plot points. While the show has been careful not to intrude into the main MCU and becoming “required” viewing in that expanding behemoth, it’s still building an essential canon of its own.</p><p>It’s still rather up in the air over what part <em>What If…?</em> is meant to play. Having many of the actors reprise their roles from the films was a way to tie it into the larger universe, while the change in medium from live-action to animation set it apart from not just the films, but series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. Being billed as an anthology gave it license to do a lot less long-term character building than those two programs as well.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bb9fe1f0-26e0-11ec-ad5f-5cae286cd18c" style="height:869;width:1917;" alt="The Watcher with the " data-uuid="4e7da64a-5b1d-322e-b634-5ed2dfd7c01c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>However, in practice it feels a lot like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a>, which completely changed how we saw the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe — it even downplayed the Infinity Stones at several points! Taking major threats of the MCU and greeting them with a ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯ says that even <em>What If….?</em> isn’t all that interested in retreading old stories and is ready to move on with the rest of the Marvel properties. It may be inessential canon, but it still wants to keep up with the main event. And that’s not how an anthology is supposed to work.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2a3e1a9-2e81-438e-ab30-e2878595346b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 12:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633552417</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T20:33:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbb450c0-26e0-11ec-bfe5-45f8aab9af84" width="1920" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbb450c0-26e0-11ec-bfe5-45f8aab9af84" width="1920" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Infinity Ultron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Infinity Ultron]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audio-Technica’s new fast-pairing true wireless earbuds only cost $79]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-s220bt-headphones-budget-multipoint-pairing-voice-assistant-215046389.html">Audio-Technica</a> has released a new true wireless earbuds model that you can add to your holiday shopping list if you&#39;re looking for a pair that costs below $100.

The two more expensive models, the Volt 276 and Volt 476, also have built-in analog 1176-type compressor circuits and presets for vocals, guitar. etc. The only thing missing is the digital signal processing (DSP) found in higher-end products like the Apollo lineup, though that&#39;s to be expected at these price points.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ec2948785d864e00b9019c833f1338d9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRMoVt4zNOc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>UA isn&#39;t the first high-end gear maker to target bedroom producers, as Solid State Logic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-solid-state-logic-ssl-2-plus-audio-interface.html">recently unveiled</a> an affordable line of interfaces.

The company offers a range of designs at affordable prices that undercut much of the competition. What&#39;s more, Anker doesn&#39;t make many sacrifices when it comes to sound, performance and features to keep those prices low. Today, the company debuts the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Liberty 3 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3uMod0Q">Liberty 3 Pro</a>: a $170 follow-up to 2019&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">Liberty 2 Pro</a> that adds active noise cancellation (ANC), improved audio and a refined design.&nbsp;</p><p>The Liberty 3 Pro has a similar look to the Liberty 2 Pro with silicone fit wings and a shape that&#39;s built to relieve pressure and discomfort. Anker says the new earbuds are 30 percent smaller than the previous model and they&#39;re IPX4 rated for moisture protection. On-board controls return to give you easy access to music and calls. Inside, the company explains that &quot;an upgraded dual driver configuration&quot; developed alongside nearly two dozen Grammy winning producers powers its &quot;best sounding model to date.&quot; Anker&#39;s Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture (ACAA) has been updated to version 2.0, enabling more detail without distortion. The Liberty 3 Pro also supports Sony&#39;s LDAC codec for wireless audio, a standard that transmits more data over Bluetooth for high-res listening.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0580f360-271b-11ec-bf11-cac4f42d60f8" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro" data-uuid="92df80be-8983-3bc5-8b1f-1a1cef1d582f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker/Soundcore</div></figure><p>The biggest addition here is ANC. The noise-cancelling setup employs Anker&#39;s HearID tech that can tailor the sound profile of the earbuds to your hearing. After a quick hearing test, HearID can increase certain frequencies that may be more difficult for you to hear in each ear. HearID also powers the active noise cancelling tech here, automatically customizing the level of noise reduction based on the clamor around you. Anker says the system creates an individual sound profile that accounts for in-ear pressure as well. The Liberty 3 Pro is also outfitted with AI-powered background noise reduction for calls and three ambient sound modes for a variety of scenarios.</p><p>Anker says the Liberty 3 Pro will last up to six hours on a charge with ANC on or up to eight hours with noise cancellation disabled. The included case supports wireless charging and holds up to three additional charges. A quick-charge feature will give you three hours of use in just 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Liberty 3 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3uMod0Q">Liberty 3 Pro</a> is available today for $169.99 (£139.99/€159.99/$199.99 CAD) in black, white, gray and purple color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9ea8045a-383d-45c8-b036-bcdbe0c9c20b</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 10:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608156</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:02:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anker/Soundcore]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sky's first smart TVs point to Comcast's box-less future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sky’s long journey to move beyond satellite TV is finally over, as the company launches its brand new internet-only TV platform. <a href="https://www.sky.com/glass">Sky Glass</a> is the company’s first own-brand Smart TV, one which ditches the home-mounted satellite dish and set-top box in favor of pulling all of its content from the internet. The company’s pitch is to centralize not just its own content inside the one box, but to act as a universal platform for every streaming TV app currently available on the market. Not to mention that putting it all inside a single piece of hardware reduces the clutter that builds up underneath the family TV.</p><p>On the hardware front, Sky Glass comes in three sizes, 43-, 55- and 65-inch displays, all of which have 4K Quantum Dot LED screens with 10-bit HDR+ and Dolby Vision. It ships in five colors: Blue, White, Green, Pink or Black, with matching remote controls, speaker fascias and stands. On the audio front, Sky says that you won’t need a soundbar with this kit, since the hardware comes with six-speaker Dolby Atmos sound, as well as a subwoofer, built-in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>(The company added that, consequently, Sky Glass is up to 50 percent more energy efficient than your current set-up since you’ll not be powering a discrete set-top-box and soundbar.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/673be4b0-2753-11ec-a38b-3c22fc2bf4d1" alt="Image of the new Sky Glass voice remote" data-uuid="600bcfd9-d1db-3d19-a30d-49d1a078bf07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>But Sky’s value proposition isn’t just that it’s selling a fancy TV with some streaming bits inside, but a whole new way to end the infinite scroll. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-29-sky-q-review.html">Sky Q,</a> the company already positioned itself as a curation layer between you and the content you want, but this takes it a big step forward. It’s designed to aggregate all of the catalogs from all of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-netflix-is-now-available-on-sky-q-boxes.html">streaming apps</a> available and let you pick and choose what you want from one centralized location. That means you can watch episodes of the same TV series, in order, even if they’re hosted on different streaming platforms.</p><p>Sky Glass is also voice-activated, with the wake word ‘Hello Sky,” and you should be able to access all of your favorite shoes, live TV and play listed content with it. But if you’d prefer, you can use the new remote, which is a simplified version of the touch remote already available for Sky Q, albeit with backlit buttons for better night-time operation.</p><p>At the same time, Sky also announced a 4K webcam which it is planning to release at some point in the future which will sit on top of the TV and offer Portal-esque video calls. This system also offers motion-tracking and skeleton tracking for both motion gaming and customized workouts, and it even looks like a Kinect. When this hardware is available, you’ll also be able to have watching parties for live TV even when you’re not in the same location.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83e9f700-2753-11ec-bfff-3d3befa6701e" alt="Image of three sizes of Sky Glass TV" data-uuid="283c77cd-d1ce-3fb7-bfe5-d6a9b67db071"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>Of course, given that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-22-comcast-to-acquire-sky.html">Sky is owned by Comcast</a> and the company is rumored to be working on its own TV platform, you can assume for yourself that a rebranded version of Sky Glass is coming to the US. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/comcast-xclass-tv-hisense"><em>Protocol</em></a> reports that Comcast has been working on a product, dubbed the XClass TV, for the US market. In addition, Sky says that Glass will not just be available in the UK and Europe, but also in Australia and other markets across the next year or so.</p><p>Price-wise, Sky Glass will cost £649, £849 or £1,049 depending on if you opt for the 43-, 55- or 65-inch version. It will be available in the UK on October 18th. But the company says that it expects more people to buy it on a monthly subscription contract, much as it does with phones via Sky Mobile, for a minimum contract term. In that instance, the hardware will set you back £13, £17, or £21 per month, depending on which size you opt for.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ec92515-ceef-4579-afae-189ee2be6f29</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 09:55:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633606707</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T11:38:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4e80de80-2753-11ec-b97f-00b4ce7886d5" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4e80de80-2753-11ec-b97f-00b4ce7886d5" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sky]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Promotional image of Sky Glass]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sky Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
