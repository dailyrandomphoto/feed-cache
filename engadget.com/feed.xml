The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/4eoAKM">Google Nest Audio</a>, for instance, is now listed for $60, which is $40 less than its standard price and is the lowest we&#39;ve seen for the speaker. In case you missed the chance to purchase the device at that price from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-hits-new-low-of-60-at-bh-photo-150717380.html">B&amp;H Photo</a> in October, here&#39;s another chance to do so. The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yR9vLv">second-gen Google Nest Hub</a> is also on sale for $50, which is only $10 more than what the first-gen Nest Hub goes for these days.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/4eoAKM" id="4ed0304ffd784910bbfa411792786038" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Google Nest Audio at Best Buy - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yR9vLv" id="b9718b1a7d214c95b6d34b250d6eb5fd" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Google Nest Hub 2nd Gen at Best Buy - $50</a><p>We gave the Nest Audio a score of 87 in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-first-generation-40-deal-best-buy-151238609.html">review</a> and called it a steal at $100. The smart speaker offers much better audio quality than Google&#39;s older speaker models, which can be improved further if you pair two of them in stereo. We also praised it for its attractive minimalist design: The device is fully covered in audio-transparent cloth that comes in five colors. Meanwhile, we gave the second-gen Nest Hub <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">a score of 89</a>, praising it for having a louder and clearer display than its predecessor.

The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/x9Qvbd">Nest Hub Max</a>, with its 10-inch display and camera, is on sale for $180, down $50 from its normal price of $230. We gave it a score of 86 in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">review</a> and praised it for its great screen, gesture control capability for media playback and ability to double as a Nest Cam. The <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ao2QGj">Google Nest WiFi 2-pack</a>, which comes with a mesh WiFi router and an access point, is also currently on sale for $179. That&#39;s $89 less than the two-pack&#39;s usual price. The router and the single access point can cover up to 3,800 square feet, and the point comes with a built-in smart speaker with access to Google Assistant.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ao2QGj" id="f62bcb92390c4ba8af993f0120af963a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Google Nest WiFi Mesh Router 2-Pack at Best Buy - $179</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/x9Qvbd" id="39d758fe018d48d59debebb2e8fe961b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Google Nest Hub Max at Best Buy - $180</a><p>If you want a Google&#39;s smaller smart speakers instead of the bigger Nest Audio to place around your home, the <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/donvZq">Nest Mini</a> is also on sale for $25, down 50 percent from its original price of $50.

Astronomers using NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-spinning-black-holes-nasa.html">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/chandra-sees-evidence-for-possible-planet-in-another-galaxy.html">detected</a> what might be the first signs of a planet in another galaxy.  The team noticed dips in X-ray brightness that hint at a planet transiting in front of a star in the Messier 51 (aka M51) galaxy 28 million light-years away. For context, all the exoplanet candidates in the Milky Way are no more than 3,000 light-years from Earth — this planet would easily set a distance record if confirmed.</p><p>The very nature of stars made the feat possible. As the researchers had to focus on X-ray bright binary systems where the region of bright rays is relatively tiny, the transit was considerably easier to spot. Conventional detection of nearby stars requires much more sensitive light detection, as a planet might only block a small amount of light from a given star.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The planet itself is believed to be as large as Saturn, but would orbit its hosts (a star 20 times the mass of the Sun as well as a black hole or neutron star) at twice the distance.</p><p>Scientists didn&#39;t believe the dimming was due to gas clouds or dust, as those aren&#39;t consistent with the event they recorded in M51. A planet, however, would line up with the data.</p><p>The challenge, as you might guess, is verifying that data. The planet&#39;s large orbit could rule out another transit for roughly 70 years, and it wouldn&#39;t be clear exactly when astronomers would have to take a look. The three-hour transit of this planet candidate didn&#39;t provide a large window. That&#39;s also assuming the &#39;living&#39; star doesn&#39;t explode and bathe the planet in radiation.</p><p>If there&#39;s ever a confirmation, though, the discovery would be very significant. While there aren&#39;t many doubts that planets exist in other galaxies, it would be useful to have evidence of their existence. This could also significantly widen the scope of future planetary searches to include the galactic neighborhood, not just close-by stars.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/planet-outside-milky-way-galaxy-chandra-205310684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0673993b-d822-47af-ae62-338999d414c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:53:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635713593</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T20:53:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/R.

Well-known leak purveyor Evan Blass has <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321">shared</a> what he said is an image of a 17-inch ThinkBook Plus model. Unlike the current 13.3-inch system, though, you wouldn&#39;t have to flip your machine around to use an e-paper display on the back. Instead, you&#39;d have a pen-capable color display next to the keyboard you could use to draw or take handwritten notes.</p><p>Blass didn&#39;t share other details, but the 17-inch ThinkBook Plus would seemingly have an extra-wide main display and fit in a full keyboard along with a large trackpad. We&#39;d expect reasonably speedy internals to help drive the second display, much like the vaguely comparable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-2021-dual-screen-notebook-163024528.html">ASUS ZenBook Duo</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain when this extra-large ThinkBook Plus would ship. Lenovo has historically reserved some of its largest laptop introductions for CES in January, but that doesn&#39;t preclude the company from a last-minute launch for the holidays. Either way, the image suggests Lenovo hasn&#39;t given up on the Plus concept — if anything, it&#39;s exploring new concepts that might prove appealing for creatives and others who shied away in the past.</p><div id="f23aa06029144e818d588baf04b16d90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have you guys seen this yet? 17-inch ThinkBook Plus from Lenovo... <a href="https://t.co/OElc5ZM3pb">pic.twitter.com/OElc5ZM3pb</a></p>— Ev (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-17-inch-thinkbook-plus-leak-195551383.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1936b642-ced3-488f-b8a0-16707de71129</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 19:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635710155</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T19:56:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan Blass, Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[G20 deal raises the minimum tax rate for big tech companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Large tech companies may soon have to pay significant taxes no matter what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-30-eu-commission-apple-tax-ireland.html">tax loopholes</a> they had before. <em>BBC News</em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59101218">reports</a> G20 leaders have reached an agreement that would set a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large companies. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-g20-discuss-big-tech-tax-reform.html">long-in-the-making</a> deal should be official as of today (October 31st) and would be enforced starting in 2023.</p><p>The US originally pitched the concept to prevent companies from using creative accounting (such as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Double Irish arrangement</a>&quot;) to avoid paying most of their taxes in the country. Other countries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-germany-global-minimum-tax-large-tech-companies.html">embraced the idea</a>, though, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oecd-head-defends-tax-deal-1.6232027">told</a><em>CBC News</em> the move could rake in about $150 billion from corporations around the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal could discourage tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Netflix from relying on loopholes to maximize their profits. If the deal collects the promised money, governments could better fund public services and help tackle problems like climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous criticisms, however, and not just from those who generally oppose higher taxes.

In his most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed Apple is aiming for a headset that can handle &quot;high-quality&quot; VR games with both fast chips and high-res displays. While it&#39;s not certain just what chips would be involved, a previous leak mentioned a possible 8K resolution per eye — Apple might not expect games to run at that resolution, but it would hint at serious processing power.</p><p>The headset is still poised to arrive &quot;as early as&quot; 2022, Gurman said. He also suggested Apple would eventually follow up the mixed headset with an augmented-reality-only model, but that was &quot;years down the road.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However accurate the claim might be, it&#39;s doubtful the mixed reality headset would be meant primarily for gaming The price (rumored to be as high as $3,000) might relegate it to developers and other pros. It wouldn&#39;t be a rival to the $299 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a>, then. Instead, the report suggests Apple might use this initial headset to pave the way for more affordable wearables where gaming is more realistic.</p><p>It&#39;s safe to presume Apple is committed to a headset, no matter the end result. Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-buys-nextvr-192608476.html">acquired companies</a> and reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-dan-riccio-vr-ar-headsets-162030193.html">shuffled executives</a> with mixed reality in mind. This wouldn&#39;t just be a side project for the company, even if the mixed reality tech could take years to reach the mainstream. Gaming might play a pivotal role if Apple intends to reach a wider audience.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-vr-games-160752822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc13ee04-0e70-4dea-b518-87b8944d5d81</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 16:07:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635696474</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T16:08:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Apple employee helps a member of the media try on an HTC Vive while testing the virtual reality capabilities of the new iMac during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Josh Edelson        (Photo credit should read JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-APPLE-DEVELOPERS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon offers steep discounts on recent Echo devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This may be one of your best chances of scoring a smart speaker or e-reader before the holiday rush.

The newer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 5 and 8</a>, meanwhile, build on that Alexa know-how with visuals. The Show 5 fits best as a bedside clock, while the 8 works well for video calls or as a family hub in the kitchen or living room. The main hiccups are simply the interface and streaming app selections — Google has a slight edge in both departments, but that might not matter much if you&#39;re mainly using voice commands or checking the news and weather.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kindle-sale-142212659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45c394b7-d10c-48d5-b6c8-65e53208a266</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 14:22:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635690135</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T14:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iRobot's poop-detecting Roomba j7+ vacuum is cheaper than ever right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot&#39;s latest Roomba that can detect obstacles — including pet poop — along its cleaning journey is cheaper than ever right now.

The AI-driven computer vision technology allows the device to detect obstacles and move around them as it cleans, and you can label those obstacles as permanent (in the case of a chair or another piece of furniture) or temporary. Not only does this mean the j7 robots should better navigate around things like piles of clothes and charging cords, but they can also detect a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis: pet poop. iRobot even has a Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.) which states that you&#39;ll get a new robot vacuum if your j7+ runs into poop in the first year of you owning it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that, the j7 series takes advantage of iRobot&#39;s improved mobile app, which lets you schedule cleanings and set routine triggers. You can also label rooms in your home after the robot has created a map, so you can better direct it to a specific room when you only need a quick clean.</p><p>While the clean base included in the j7+ package isn&#39;t necessary, it takes the convenience level up a notch. Instead of emptying your robot&#39;s bin after every job, the j7+ will automatically empty its contents into the clean base when it&#39;s done. You then only have to worry about emptying the base once every two months.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-poop-detecting-roomba-j7-plus-vacuum-is-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-123037360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06add5ac-054c-4440-85ca-bb5f35c1b30a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 12:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635683164</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T12:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lego adds 'Luigi's Mansion' sets to its Super Mario World collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-super-mario-luigi-bowser-airship-110034682.html">Luigi is part of Lego Super Mario</a>, the toymaker is ready to show the other heroic plumber a little more respect. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/newsroom/">Lego</a> has introduced a trio of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-review.html"><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em></a> expansion sets that give its namesake star more to do in a game designed with him in mind.</p><p>The $30 Lab and Poltergust set helps you get started with Luigi&#39;s ghost vacuum, while a $40 Entryway set introduces you to the mansion proper as well as Polterpup and the  game series&#39; Boo ghosts.

And Cherlynn Low used Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro and found that the camera-heavy handsets have a lot more to offer, including a great starting price.</p><h2>The new MacBook Pros have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">ton of power (and ports)</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/86d0a220-38ec-11ec-a5b3-8a860be049ef" alt="Apple MacBook 14- and 16-inch (2021)" data-uuid="b1825893-d730-3e58-a67d-89d139389744"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-" href="https://amzn.to/3vZ88Wj">14-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MacBook Pros" href="https://amzn.to/2ZyVocC">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> are precisely what media professionals have been waiting for: speedy M1 Pro and Max processors, a comfortable keyboard, serious battery life and great speakers. They also feature most of the crucial ports MacBooks have been missing for years, including (finally!) an SD card reader, though the laptops are thicker and heavier as a result. And of course, all that comes with a high starting price of $1,999.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devindra was particularly impressed by the Liquid Retina XDR displays, which come close to 4K resolutions, and have mini-LED backlighting to produce up to 1,600 nits of brightness. He was also pleased to find support for 120Hz refresh rates, and by the benchmark testing in which both MacBook Pros blew away competing Windows PCs. However, while the laptops were able to speedily convert a 4K video clip to 1080p, Devindra doesn&#39;t think they&#39;d make the best gaming machines — trying to load <em>Borderlands 3 </em>produced an unplayable mess. Overall though, he says these computers have practically everything one, especially a creative professional, would want in a powerful notebook — as long as you can stomach the price tag.</p><h2>The third-gen Airpods have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">better fit and more features</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/11b916b0-38ed-11ec-bdd2-cd470a053d1c" alt="Apple AirPods 3rd-Gen (2021)" data-uuid="f6c7b56c-986d-3366-9ee0-114255c6ccff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple’s latest <a href="https://amzn.to/31jfWqF">AirPods</a> have been almost completely redesigned from the previous version; the buds themselves have a new look, courtesy of the contoured shape which reduces weight and features a tapered silhouette and an angle to increase comfort. Billy Steele says the company’s efforts to build better AirPods have paid off: the new buds are more comfortable and and have much better audio quality, with bigger and more immersive sound that remained open and airy. That’s thanks to a custom driver paired with a high-dynamic-range amplifier, as well as the new H1 chip and the inward facing mic. Billy says these changes made the AirPods something he actively wanted to listen to music with.</p><p>The new AirPods also have an IPX4 rating so they’ll survive sweaty workouts or small splashes. They can also detect skin which, combined with the built-in accelerometer, makes for more accurate pausing and extends battery life. The new chip means you can listen to tracks in Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and the spatial audio is available with dynamic head tracking to change the position of the audio when you turn your head. However, the latest AirPods still lack active noise cancellation and Transparency mode as these features are still reserved for the pricier AirPods Pro. While Billy acknowledges that these earbuds aren’t for everyone, he says they continue to offer Apple users features that are well integrated with iPhone, iPad and Mac.</p><h2>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">excellent phones with great prices</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbc195f0-38ef-11ec-a9e2-fd44c6629b33" alt="Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro " data-uuid="df05aa6a-db9f-30d8-bcc6-522c84a7426a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says the newest Google phones — the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bnGoRv">Pixel 6</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3mpn6l0">6 Pro</a> — are the most intriguing phones that the company has made in years. Featuring the first Google mobile processor, Tensor, the two handsets also have improved camera hardware, lovely OLED screens, speedy refresh rates (120Hz for the 6 Pro, 90Hz for the 6), and decent speakers. Cherlynn says the best feature is the surprisingly low starting price — only $599 — which makes some of the drawbacks more forgivable.</p><p>One of the issues she had with the phones was the laggy under-screen fingerprint sensor, which requires the display to be on before it unlocked — a process that she says doesn’t need to have two steps. She was more impressed by the new voice keyboard, which did an excellent job of transcribing speech, and the additional camera features. The sensors are sharper and bigger with larger pixels, producing bright, clean photos — and special camera features, like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur, give users a lot of control over their photos. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro excelled in our battery tests, too, lasting 20.5 hours and 17 hours, respectively. Overall, Cherlynn calls the handsets a superb return to form, showing off Google’s strengths in the software and photography departments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-apples-new-macbook-pros-have-nearly-everything-youd-want-160049252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">634b1803-994b-413e-9fbe-b22038c853a8</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635539639</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T20:34:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's worst shipping delay is for a $19 polishing cloth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;d think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">global supply shortages</a> would hit Apple&#39;s tech products the hardest, but that&#39;s apparently not the case.

Order the microfiber cloth from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth">company store</a> as of this writing and you&#39;ll wait 10 to 12 weeks — in other words, you won&#39;t get your Apple-branded polishing experience until January 2022 at the earliest.

Using the new port, it’s possible to get three hours of uptime after 15 minutes of charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f31d1a40-38f0-11ec-a6b7-3b40ab31ec12" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Arctis 7+" data-uuid="826f3caa-c504-3672-938c-3009701b4f7e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SteelSeries</div></figure><p>On that note, battery life is also improved. SteelSeries claims you can get up to 30 hours of gameplay on a single charge, up from the approximately 24 hours you got from the previous version. As for the differences between the 7+ and 7P+, there aren’t many. You can buy the latter in both black and white colorways where the former is only available in black. Additionally, the 7P+ includes support for the PlayStation 4 and PS5’s 3D Audio functionality. That said, you can use both headsets with pretty much any system or device other than Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Arctis 7+ and Arctis 7P+ are available to buy today from the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyl.as_t1_294_8u56lfixcjmqaajkwio84hcb6_2_11d0ed3b19c29a96a30f592a5b5930e03c8f7153b6ff78dbe663c4a4aaed4985&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=lpQ468hfON-YVPYCoKRWx9nLjHJnve1xEz23vLxo-Yc&amp;m=ehdInLXexLYqy7pJy-Cu4IBi9bKZHrX-IuaUBKQIlQE&amp;s=8V8KUb1_KuoDHp4Xwma_BS7zP3pKqNmPffnHMBfu78I&amp;e=">SteelSeries website</a>. They’ll both set you back $170. That’s an increase from the $150 MSRP of Arctis 7 and 7P, but what&#39;s an extra $20 when you don&#39;t have to deal with micro USB anymore.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-arctis-7-7plus-annoucement-195740872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">886ba982-655b-41ac-aeb8-13a090068db0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:57:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635537465</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T19:57:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SteelSeries]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla recalls nearly 3,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over separating suspensions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD#recalls">recalling</a> 2,791 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over concerns that their front suspension lateral link fasteners may loosen, potentially shifting the wheel alignment and increasing the risk of a crash.

As of September 30th, the company said it held equity investments, &quot;including preferred stock of Rivian Automotive,&quot; valued at $3.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion at the end of 2020. That Amazon should own a fifth of Rivian is not surprising. In 2019, the retailer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-amazon-rivian-investment-electric-pickup-truck-suv.html">led a $700 million investment round</a> in the automaker, contributing about $440 million to that total.&nbsp;</p><p>That same year, it announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-jeff-bezos-amazon-climate-change-paris-agreement.html">as part of its 2040 climate pledge</a> it would purchase 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian.

It comes with five free and nine paid &quot;Marquee Items,&quot; and the pack itself costs 1,000 Valorant Points, the game&#39;s in-game currency. According to Riot associate art director Sean Marino, the Battlepass is focused on bringing some fall holiday vibes to the game. Given that one of the items Marino mentioned is meant to fit in with Halloween, it&#39;s a little bit of a bummer that this doesn&#39;t launch until after the holiday.

On Friday, Marvel announced its working with Hennig’s Skydance New Media studio on a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/skydance-new-media-marvel-entertainment-all-new-interactive-title"><ins>narrative-driven action-adventure game</ins></a> set in its comic book universe. Details on the project are sparse, but the Disney-owned company teased the title will feature a “completely original story and take on the Marvel Universe.”</p><div id="a12cfb3ab258444e9cfcd264b4037b0d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After holding our cards close to the vest for so long, we’re excited to finally be able to share the news!

It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In some ways, it’s a surprise to find out Hennig is working on a AAA title. When she left EA after the publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-17-ea-shuts-down-visceral-games.html"><ins>shut down Visceral</ins></a>, it seemed like she wanted a change of pace. &quot;I would love to have a little company of about six to eight people, 15 at the most, and then do smaller projects,&quot; she said at the time. But then the possibility of working with Marvel may have been too difficult to ignore, especially for a new studio working on its first-ever game. Much like it’s done in Hollywood, the company has started to pull in talent from every corner of the gaming industry.
