Now, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23689535011&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=7635a48c60ffd1a60ba56260b8140678&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">adding</a> two new specific Alexa sound detectors for &quot;water running&quot; and &quot;appliance beeping&quot; that can be used to set up routines or reminders. It also rolled a number of other new features for things like prescription refills, ultrasound motion detection and more.&nbsp;</p><p>It was already possible to have Alexa identify those two specific sounds, but the new update means you won&#39;t have to bother training it. With the new features, you can use the Alexa app to send a notification when the washer beeps to indicate your laundry is done. It can also remind you to turn off the sink of someone accidentally leaves the water running.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along the same lines, the update includes the introduction of ultrasound motion detection for routines on select Echo devices. At its September event, Amazon said that a feature would arrive to fourth-gen Echo and Echo Dot devices, designed to use an &quot;inaudible ultrasound wave&quot; to detect if there are people in a room. With the new routines, you can use Alexa to turn on lights when motion is detected near the device, for instance, or lower the thermostat when no motion is detected.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature allows Amazon Pharmacy customers to ask Alexa to refill prescriptions and get proactive updates when they&#39;re delivered. &quot;You can also ask Alexa to call Amazon Pharmacy to connect with an Amazon Pharmacy customer care representative who can answer questions on topics like prescription status, account, billing, and also drug information and side effects,&quot; Amazon said.&nbsp;</p><p>Other new features include &quot;preference teaching&quot; that lets you teach Alexa which food or sports you like, dining suggestion (&quot;Alexa, what should I eat?&quot;), a TikTok video launcher, conversation mode (&quot;Alexa, join the conversation&quot;) and hands-free audio calls using Verizon Number share. Amazon also announced that customers can now pre-order the Echo Show 15 and have it ship on December 9th. The new features are now rolling out to Alexa devices, though some may be region-limited.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-alexa-can-tell-you-if-your-washing-machine-stops-or-water-is-running-102043428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06f443de-7b09-4ba8-95c0-948b4c37022d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 10:20:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638440446</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T10:20:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 2021 App Store Awards highlight 'connection']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-best-apps-games-2020-zoom-disney-plus-genshin-impact-disco-elysium-202554793.html">Apple focused on quarantine life </a>for its App Store Awards. For 2021, it&#39;s continuing that concept with a focus on &quot;connection&quot; as its trend of the year — basically, things that brought us together even though we&#39;re still dealing with a global pandemic. That trend award was bestowed upon five apps, including familiar names like <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble </a>and <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/"><em>Among Us</em></a><em>!.</em> But the niche winners are even more interesting: there&#39;s <a href="https://www.eatokra.com/">EatOkra</a>, an app that helps you find black-owned restaurants; <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, which helps anyone create pro-grade designs; and <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, a social network focused on connecting women to find support throughout major life events.</p><p>You&#39;d probably be surprised by some of the winners for Apple&#39;s mainstay categories too: the Apple TV app of the year was the boxing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/dazn-live-sports-streaming/id1129523589">streaming service Dazn</a>, something I&#39;ve admittedly <em>never</em> heard of. The Apple TV game of the year, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-marshals-3/id1501495423"><em>Space Marshals 3</em></a>, also came out of seemingly nowhere. But the strong review scores for both of those apps make it clear that users genuinely enjoy them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the App Store Awards are very much a marketing exercise, it&#39;s also a useful way to highlight some of the best apps users may have missed. (And I&#39;m sure developers appreciate the recognition, and the aluminum App Store icon they can display on their shelves.) <a href="https://luma-touch.com/lumafusion-for-ios-2/?gclid=Cj0KCQiA15yNBhDTARIsAGnwe0VqjSGhgp8jyRnXCX4D3NqVtxrOvTCI8HH0fhBpWRWtWqu8D8MU_-0aAvfoEALw_wcB">LumaFusion</a>, the best iPad app of the year, makes complex multi-track video editing easy to do with your fingers.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/apple-tells-suppliers-iphone-demand-has-slowed-as-holidays-near"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant has told its component suppliers that demand for its biggest moneymaker has weakened just before the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in October, the organization <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-poised-to-slash-iphone-production-goals-due-to-chip-crunch?sref=10lNAhZ9">reported</a> that Apple lowered the lineup&#39;s production goal to 80 million units — 10 million less than its original target — due to the lack of parts. However, the company was expecting to make up for the loss next year when component supplies are set to improve. Now, Apple has reportedly told its suppliers that the orders it was expecting to get next year might not materialize at all.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The global chip shortage has had significant effects on companies across industries, forcing tech companies and automakers to significantly slash their production targets. In addition to lowering the iPhone 13&#39;s production goals, Apple reportedly chose to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cuts-ipad-production-feed-chips-iphone-13-nikkei-2021-11-02/">cut back on the iPad&#39;s</a> production to be able to allocate more chips for its new phones. But some potential buyers may already have decided to skip this generation altogether after they were faced with lengthy wait times and lack of stocks at retailers. Especially since reports suggest that the iPhone 14 will be a major upgrade and will represent a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-redesign-leak-152422684.html">complete redesign</a> of the company&#39;s mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the weakening demand, analysts are still expecting Apple to reveal a sales increase of 6 percent in the final three months of 2021. It remains to be seen whether slower demand for the iPhone 13 will have a significant effect on Apple&#39;s numbers next year,  seeing as its phones have been the biggest contributors to its revenue for years.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92cfc251-e8a6-49d2-be8a-2a344295a64c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 07:09:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638429027</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T07:10:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d0b56e0-5336-11ec-affe-71f1591dace3" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d0b56e0-5336-11ec-affe-71f1591dace3" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rhodes electric piano is back with a hefty price tag]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rhodes.piano/">months of teasing</a>, the legendary Rhodes piano is back, with Rhodes Music Group <a href="https://rhodesmusic.com/">opening pre-orders</a> for the new MK8 model on Wednesday.

It says the Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform will support game streaming from consoles and PC, cloud gaming services and Android games and apps.

On Wednesday, the company announced it will move forward with the rebranding on December 10th.</p><p>“The name has many associated meanings for the company — building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,” the company said in a <a href="https://squareup.com/ca/en/press/square-changes-name-to-block?country_redirection=true"><ins>blog post</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="16fbff98cc9344f083264ae1d7f2698f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re changing our company name so we can give the full <a href="https://twitter.com/Square?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Square</a> brand to our Seller business.

Since then, its business has expanded to include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-square-free-stock-trades-cash-app.html"><ins>stock and crypto trading</ins></a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking/loans"><ins>money lending</ins></a> and more. This year, Square even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-buys-control-of-tidal-142318706.html"><ins>bought a majority stake in Tidal</ins></a>. And it’s that expansion from that the rebranding is designed to encapsulate.</p><p>“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” Dorsey said. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”</p><p>The move comes in the same week that Dorsey stepped down as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html"><ins>CEO of Twitter</ins></a>. Since 2015, he had led both Twitter and Square, a position that eventually led to pressure from activist investment firm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html"><ins>Elliott Management</ins></a>. In a lot of ways, the rebranding is also reflective of Dorsey’s well-known enthusiasm for cryptocurrency. After all, this is the man who wanted the world to know he has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350705/jack-dorsey-bitcoin-clock-house-hearing-blockclock-mini"><ins>Bitcoin clock in his kitchen</ins></a>.

But she also told Congress they should be careful with changing the law as it could have unintended consequences.</p><p>“As you consider reform to section 230, I encourage you to move forward with your eyes open to the consequences of reform,” Haugen said. “Congress has instituted carve outs to Section 230 in recent years. I encourage you to talk to human rights advocates who can help provide context on how the last reform of 230 had dramatic impacts on the safety of some of the most vulnerable people in our society, but has been rarely used for its original purpose.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle began the hearing by acknowledging the importance of Section 230, but said the courts’ interpretation of the rule should change. “To be clear, Section 230 is critically important to promoting a vibrant and free internet,” he said. “But I agree with those who suggest the courts have allowed it to stray too far.”</p><p>But throughout the hearing, there was little discussion of specific changes or potential legislation that would change 230. Many members of Congress repeated the need for bipartisan action, but there seemed to be little agreement on what actions they should take. Doyle noted in his opening statement that members of the committee have proposed four bills that would make changes to Section 230, including one that would <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-117hr5596ih_0.pdf"><ins>limit</ins></a> protections for companies that deployed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html"><ins>“malicious” algorithms</ins></a>.</p><p>But those four bills were barely discussed during the four-hour hearing, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html"><ins>once again</ins></a>, veered into other issues. Many Republican members on the committee opted to focus on “censorship,” and their belief that platforms like Facebook are biased against them. Haugen countered that Facebook could implement changes that would make the platform safer regardless of a user’s political beliefs.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time today talking about censorship ... what we need to do is make the platform safer through product choices,” Haugen said, describing how adding “friction” to resharing content could reduce the spread of misinformation. “We need solutions like friction to make the platform safe for everyone even if you don’t speak English.”</p><p>At one point, Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, appeared to grow frustrated. “I would like to say to this committee, you&#39;ve talked about this for years, but you haven&#39;t done anything,” he said. “Show me a piece of legislation that you passed. 230 reform is going to be very important for protecting kids and teens on platforms like Instagram and holding them accountable and liable. But you also as a committee have to do privacy, antitrust and design reform.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/congress-quizzes-facebook-whistleblower-on-section-230-reforms-203605272.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7097ea7-2b77-4c9b-9ad9-774019ac326f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 20:36:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638390966</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T20:36:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bf25f10-52e3-11ec-925f-bb7d0afeb7d1" width="7625" height="5083" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bf25f10-52e3-11ec-925f-bb7d0afeb7d1" width="7625" height="5083" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Williams via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 1: Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, arrives for the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology hearing titled Holding Big Tech Accountable: Targeted Reforms to Tech's Legal Immunity, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, December 1, 2021.

So it&#39;s not too surprising to see EA rush out with a slew of post-launch fixes — let those problems fester too long, and they risk losing dedicated players to <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Halo Infinite</em>. With its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-2042-update-notes-3?isLocalized=true">third update, which arrives on December 2nd</a>, <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>will get over 150 bug fixes, including some major UI improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, you&#39;ll be able to more easily see the difference between friends and foes, identify people nearby who you can revive (and vice versa), and also see who needs ammo or health. It&#39;ll also take less clicks to prepare your loadout and Plus Menu, and EA has made it easier to determine which attachments you&#39;re using. Those aren&#39;t groundbreaking changes, to be clear, but they should make the <em>BF 2042 </em>experience smoother when you&#39;re in the heat of battle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for other fixes, the new update should make matchmaking more reliable (especially when it comes to crossplay between platforms); make it easier to tell when enemies are firing at you; and menus should be a lot smoother. Looking ahead, EA says next week it&#39;ll start launching Weekly Missions, which will give you XP as you complete them. You know, like very other shooter these days. You can expect to see a cosmetic reward if you plow through all of your challenges.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2024-ui-bug-fix-update-3-201300738.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f68f5364-00bb-4203-a7ee-dd6880f073f2</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 20:13:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638389664</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T20:14:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/968778f0-52e2-11ec-bbaf-9bfaeeadfae9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/968778f0-52e2-11ec-bbaf-9bfaeeadfae9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[&#39;Battlefield 2042&#39; is getting a cleaner UI and a ton of bug fixes]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook details its takedown of a mass-harassment network]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta/Facebook is today <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/12/metas-adversarial-threat-report/">updating the world</a> on how its efforts to remove fake and adversarial networks from its platform are going. The social network has released a new report saying that it has successfully closed down a number of networks for Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (CIB). But in addition to networks of fake profiles all working in tandem, the company has also shed some light on how it deals with additional threats. This includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-targeted-harassment-policy-172858497.html">Brigading</a> — the use of negative comments and counter-posting to drown out an individual’s posts — and Mass Reporting, where Facebook’s own anti-harassment tools are used as a weapon. This is another step beyond the broader tactics the company announced back in September, where it pledged to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-social-harm-180601493.html">combat broader social harms</a> that took place on its platform.</p><p>With Brigading, the company took down what it describes as a “network of accounts that originated in Italy and France” which targeted medical professionals, journalists and public officials. Facebook says that it tracked the activity back to a European anti-vaccine conspiracy movement called “V_V,” adding that its members used a large volume of fake accounts to “mass comment on posts” from individuals and news agencies “to intimidate them and suppress their views.”In addition, those accounts posted doctored images, superimposing the swastika onto the faces of prominent doctors and accusing them of supporting nazism.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In Vietnam, Facebook took down a network that was being used to target activists and users critical of the local government. The network would submit “hundreds — in some cases thousands — of complaints against their targets through our abuse reporting flows.” Attackers also created duplicate accounts of the users they intended to silence and then reported the real account as an impersonator from the fake account. Facebook added that some of these fake accounts were automatically detected and disabled by the company’s automatic moderation tools.</p><p>As for the more old-fashioned methods of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, the company took down networks in Palestine, Poland, Belarus and China. The first was reportedly tied to Hamas, while the second two were crafted to exacerbate tensions during the humanitarian crisis on the border there. In a call with reporters, Facebook said that the Polish network had very good operational security and, so far, it has not been able to tie it to a real-world organization. The Belarusian network, on the other hand, had much poorer operational security, and so the company has tied the activity to the Belarusian KGB.</p><p>The final network, out of China, has prompted Facebook to publish a deep dive into the activity given the depth of what took place. In its report, the company says that a group created a fake profile of a Swiss biologist called Wilson Edwards who posted material critical of the US and WHO. 48 hours later, and his comments were picked up by Chinese state media, and engaged with by high-level officials. But there was no evidence that Wilson Edwards existed, which prompted the platform to close the account.</p><p>Researchers found that Edwards’ was “the work of a multi-pronged, largely unsuccessful influence operation,” involving “employees of Chinese state infrastructure companies across four continents.” Facebook wanted to make it clear that Edwards’ comments were not engaged with organically, and it was only when the posts were reported by state media did things suddenly rise in prominence.</p><p>One thing that Facebook did identify is the use of guides which were used to train potential network members. The V_V network, for instance, published videos through its Telegram channels that suggested that users replace letters in key words so that it wouldn’t be picked up by automatic filtering. The people behind the Chinese network, too, would sometimes inadvertently post notes from their leaders, written in Indonesian and Chinese, offering tips on how best to amplify this content.</p><p>In addition, Facebook has announced that it has launched a tool, through CrowdTangle, to enable OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) researchers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-researcher-api-fringe-groups-195545901.html">study disinformation networks</a>. This includes storing any content taken down by the company, allowing a small list of approved third parties the chance to analyze it. Access has, so far, been limited to teams from the Digital Forensic Research Lab at the Atlantic Council, Stanford Internet Observatory, Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Graphika and Cardiff University.</p><p>Facebook believes that offering greater detail and transparency around how it finds these networks will enable researchers in the OSINT community to better track them in future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-mass-reporting-brigading-200023029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d303d34-0e51-4123-99ec-57f939269d02</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 20:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638388911</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T20:01:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93515460-382c-11ec-afbf-0d13b5c636cd" width="6085" height="4057" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93515460-382c-11ec-afbf-0d13b5c636cd" width="6085" height="4057" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kelly Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 28: Facebook debuts its new company brand, Meta, at their headquarters on October 28, 2021 in Menlo Park, California.

Match has <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0000891103/000089110321000093/mtch-20211201.htm">agreed</a> to settle the case by paying $441 million from its cash reserves. In return, the Tinder co-creators will dismiss the claims from both the lawsuit and linked arbitration.</p><p>The court battle began in 2018, when the plaintiffs accused Tinder&#39;s parent organizations Match and IAC of manipulating financial data (including a secret merger with Match) to artificially lower Tinder&#39;s valuation and illegally deny stock options to workers. The plaintiffs also alleged that interim Tinder chief Greg Blatt sexually harassed marketing VP and co-founder Rosette Pambakian in 2016. Tinder fired the employees in response to their lawsuit, and Pambakian separately sued Blatt, IAC and Match Group over the assault claims.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Match for comment.

The company originally demanded &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in damages (around $2 billion, to be more exact) for the claimed Match and IAC manipulation — it&#39;s getting a fraction of that payout after three years. While Match is still on the hook, it&#39;s not taking long-lasting damage as a result.</p><p><strong>Update 12/1 1:20PM ET:</strong> Match Group told Engadget the settlement also covers Pambakian&#39;s sexual assault claims.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/match-group-tinder-lawsuit-settlement-174027977.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">72f5d454-8598-49f1-af63-56772e6ac220</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638394978</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T21:43:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d87feab0-3c1e-11ec-bffb-f09244607a1f" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d87feab0-3c1e-11ec-bffb-f09244607a1f" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SPAIN - 2021/10/13: In this photo illustration a Tinder logo seen displayed on a smartphone on top of a computer keyboard.

And we say it doesn&#39;t work, we mean it&#39;s almost entirely broken. Most people report they can&#39;t run any of the software they&#39;ve downloaded from Amazon. Yet others say they don&#39;t see any apps when they visit the marketplace. An Amazon forum post spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>succinctly captures the situation many Appstore users find themselves in after installing Android 12.</p><p>&quot;My rain radar app from the Amazon Appstore is still happily running and giving me alerts via notifications, but I can&#39;t actually see them because it is being prevented from running full screen by the Amazon Appstore&#39;s failure to run properly,&quot; said forum user Lovingboth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon has yet to say when it plans to fix the problem. The company only added a notice to the top of the Appstore about the Android 12 issues earlier this week. &quot;We&#39;re excited about Android 12 too,&quot; the notification says. &quot;Unfortunately we&#39;re working through some issues. Thank you for your patience as we get your Appstore back.&quot;</p><p>As <a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html"><em><ins>Liliputing</ins></em></a> points out, the Appstore&#39;s problems with Android 12 likely stem from incompatibility between Amazon&#39;s built-in DRM and Google&#39;s new operating system. &quot;We are aware and working to resolve an issue impacting app performance and launches for the small number of Amazon Appstore users that have upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices,&quot; an Amazon spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>. &quot;This issue does not impact Amazon Fire Tablets or Fire TV devices.&quot;</p><p>With Android 12 only available on a handful of devices and most using the Play Store to download their apps, it&#39;s not a problem that affects many people. Still, it&#39;s one that&#39;s poised to become more widespread as the update rolls out to more devices, particularly if Amazon doesn&#39;t work quickly to resolve it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-app-store-broken-android-12-173131316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bcce597-ce9b-444b-9080-0caace33cbd0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:31:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638379850</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T17:30:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/abf05ad0-52ca-11ec-be3b-905bedf8abbe" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/abf05ad0-52ca-11ec-be3b-905bedf8abbe" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's $9,000 drone for its Alpha cameras is available for pre-order]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months later than originally planned, <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/sony"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has <a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-airpeak-s1-professional-drone-now-available-to-order">opened</a> pre-orders for its first drone for professionals.

The drone has a top speed of just under 56mph.</p><p>The Airpeak Flight app for iOS provides real-time status info and updates on the hardware. With the Airpeak Base web app, users can create advanced, repeatable flight plans, manage the drone and camera and troubleshoot issues. There&#39;s also a dual operation mode, which allows one person to control the drone and another to operate the camera and gimbal. Both users can see what the camera is capturing.</p><p>The Airpeak S1 comes with two sets of propellers, two rechargeable batteries and a controller. Sony has shaved $1,000 off the previously announced price — the drone now costs a still-eye-watering <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1"><ins>$9,000</ins></a>. The S1 should ship on December 24th, so it might arrive a little too late to be an extremely generous holiday gift.</p><p>There&#39;s an optional cloud service called Airpeak Plus that offers extra storage, enhanced geofencing tools and flight log importing and exporting.

Starting today, the digital car key function that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-key-183057490.html"><ins>announced at Google I/O</ins></a> in May is available on Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 for compatible BMW vehicles in select countries. You can use your phone to lock and unlock the doors, and start the engine. The feature is likely coming to other vehicles later — Google has been working with other, unnamed automakers on support for digital car keys.</p><p>There&#39;s now an option to open <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%20auto/"><ins>Android Auto</ins></a> automatically when you connect your device to a compatible car. In addition, the home screen will have an always-on play button, so you can fire up your favorite music with a single tap.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Smart reply options (which will arrive in the coming months) will offer more ways to respond to text messages while you&#39;re driving. You can tap to reply or create a custom message with the help of Google Assistant. Also coming soon, there&#39;ll be a faster way to search for music in your media apps. Just tap the search button and say the name of your favorite artist or song.</p><p>Other media-centric options are coming to the home screen of Android 12 proper. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube%20music/"><ins>YouTube Music</ins></a> widget, for instance, includes playback controls and recently played songs. Two other widgets are rolling out next week. One for Google Play Books offers access to your library of books and could help you keep track of where you are in audiobooks.</p><div id="315b3824a81e436d8fd10bf02faccb34"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hp-lGxwPUnI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A Google Photos People &amp; Pets widget, meanwhile, provides an easy way to bring your loved ones to the home screen.

It&#39;s a curated selection of photos and videos from holidays and events like birthdays and graduations, which are displayed in a stories format.

You can set up the feature to alert you and your family with bells and notifications when it&#39;s time to do certain things, such as picking up kids from school or getting to bed at a decent hour. Family members can set or customize as many bells as they like on their own devices to keep stay on schedule. Google will offer suggested bells too, including holiday-themed ones like volunteering for a local cause or watering the tree.</p><p>In Gboard&#39;s Emoji Kitchen, you&#39;ll see thousands more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html"><ins>emoji mashups</ins></a>. They&#39;ll be available for Gboard Beta users starting today and for everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Last, but not least, Google announced another Android security measure. To help protect your privacy, your device will automatically turn off runtime permissions (which allow apps to access data or carry out actions for you) in apps you haven&#39;t used in a while. You can turn these permissions back on in the app or the device settings. The feature will be available on Android 12 at first. Starting next month, Google plans to roll it out to devices with Google Play services running Android 6.0 or later.</p><div id="f25b59b5996c40c6826921bec94efca9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKqSayojRkg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-keys-assistant-widgets-photos-youtube-music-170006763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e177addb-cd0c-43c7-8d13-cabf4842388f</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638373708</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T15:48:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration showing a selection of new Android 12 features.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon and Bang & Olufsen made soundbars with Android TV built-in]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent company) isn&#39;t just relying on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-verizon-stream-tv.html">no-frills media players</a> to push its Stream TV platform.

But, in 2021, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google continued to improve their operating systems for machines that do double duty. Windows 11 has features that make it friendlier for multi-screen devices, while Android 12L is on the horizon and promises an optimized experience for larger displays. Plus, with the rise of ARM-based chips for laptops, especially Apple’s impressive M1 series, prospects for a powerful 2-in-1 with a vast touch-friendly app ecosystem is at an all-time high.</p><p>These machines still have their limits, of course. Since they’re smaller than proper laptops, they tend to have less-powerful processors. Keyboards also tend to be less sturdy, with condensed layouts and shallower key travel. Plus, they’re almost always tablets first, leaving you to buy a keyboard case separately. (And those ain’t cheap.) So, you can’t always assume the advertised price is what you’ll actually spend on the 2-in-1 you want.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sometimes, getting a third-party keyboard might be just as good, and they’re often cheaper than first-party offerings. If you’re looking to save some money, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Slim Folio" href="https://amzn.to/2K0q2DT">Logitech’s Slim Folio</a> is a cheaper option, and if you don’t need your keyboard to attach to your tablet, Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3eYAHe0">K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard</a> is also a good pick.</p><p>While we’ve typically made sure to include a budget 2-in-1 in previous years, this time there isn’t a great choice. We would usually go with a Surface Go, but the 2021 model is too expensive. Other alternatives, like cheaper Android tablets, are underpowered and don’t offer a great multitasking interface. If you want something around $500 that’s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you’re better off this year looking at a conventional laptop (like those on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">our best budget PCs list</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c7370210-25c8-11eb-bfef-f2bf92a9b702" alt="Apple iPad Pro 12.9 2020"><figcaption>Chris Velazco / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>When you’re shopping for a 2-in-1, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First, look at the spec sheet to see how heavy the tablet is (alone, and with the keyboard). Most modern hybrids weigh less than 2 pounds, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">the 1.96-pound Surface Pro 8</a> being one of the heaviest around. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad Pro 12.9 (2021)</a> and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7+ are both slightly lighter. If the overall weight of the tablet and its keyboard come close to 3 pounds, you’ll be better off just getting an ultraportable laptop.</p><p>You’ll also want to opt for an 11-inch or 12-inch screen instead of a smaller 10-inch model. The bigger displays will make multitasking easier, plus their companion keyboards will be much better spaced. Also, try to get 6GB of RAM if you can for better performance — you’ll find this in the base model of the Galaxy Tab S7+, while this year’s iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 8 start with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Finally, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more, and that’s not counting what you’ll pay for data. And, as for 5G — you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that’s barely faster than LTE.&nbsp;</p><h2>Engadget Picks</h2><h2>Best overall: Surface Pro 8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/088f94b0-2533-11ec-b9a3-0ab15069c542" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 8 and Signature Pro Keyboard accessory." data-uuid="27319964-9d1e-3c8f-8e95-daa497cb8401"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no beating the Surface series when it comes to 2-in-1s. They’re powerful, sleek tablets running an OS that’s actually designed for productivity. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro 8" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm">Surface Pro 8</a> is Microsoft’s latest and it addresses most of the issues we had with its predecessor. It’s thinner and looks more modern, borrowing the design of last year’s Pro X. Plus, it has a 120Hz display that makes scrolling endless spreadsheets or emails feel much faster. Just remember to drop the refresh rate to 60Hz if you want to get respectable battery life out of this thing. Windows 11 also offers a better split-screen experience for on-the-go multitasking.</p><p>Like most of the other 2-in-1s on this list, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">Pro 8</a> doesn’t come with a keyboard cover — you’ll have to pay extra for that. That’s a shame, considering it starts at $1,099. Microsoft offers a variety of Type Covers for its Surface Pros ranging from $100 to $180, depending on whether you want a slot for a stylus on it. But at least they’re comfortable and well-spaced. You can also get the Surface Slim Pen 2 ($130) for sketching out your diagrams or artwork, and it also features haptic feedback for a more responsive experience.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm" id="c2e258171d43476ba6c01350018b5e56" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Surface Pro 8 at Microsoft starting at $1,099</a><h2>Best for Apple users: 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/6c1a9ec0-b815-11eb-8b33-87fbb637229f" style="height:1542;width:3000;" alt="Apple iPad Pro (2021) review" data-uuid="9ab5c248-d237-3cd3-9d5c-a973b9bcf0da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, the best option for you is obviously an iPad. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:12-inch Pro" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9">12-inch Pro</a> is our pick. Like older models, this iPad Pro has a stunning 12.9-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, but this year it uses mini-LED backlighting to deliver greater dynamic range. Apple’s M1 chipset is impressively fast too, and more than good enough for most tasks. Plus, the latest iPadOS is superior to older versions thanks to widgets and quick notes support.</p><p>Apple’s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Magic Keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3HpetiZ">Magic Keyboard</a> provides a satisfying typing experience, and its trackpad means you won’t have to reach for the screen to launch apps. But it’ll also cost you an extra $300, making it the most expensive case on this list by a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad</a> also lacks a headphone jack and its webcam is awkwardly positioned along the left bezel when you prop it up horizontally, so be aware that it’s still far from a perfect laptop replacement. Still, with its sleek design and respectable battery life, the iPad Pro 12.9 is a good 2-in-1 for Apple users.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9" id="f16fcb2f983c407eb02d3247a2abe4f4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 12.9-inch iPad Pro at Amazon - $1,099</a><h2>Best for Android users: Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/7db721a0-25c9-11eb-be9f-3d20d2583a4c" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+"><figcaption>Cherlynn Low / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>While Windows is better than iPadOS and Android for productivity, it lags the other two when it comes to apps specifically designed for touchscreens.

Though it was released last year, it’s still the best Android-powered 2-in-1 around. You’ll enjoy watching movies and playing games on its gorgeous 12.4-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, and Samsung includes the S Pen, which is great for sketching and taking notes. The Snapdragon 865+ processor and 6GB of RAM keep things running smoothly, too.</p><p>Thankfully the company significantly improved its keyboard case over previous models, with more comfortable and responsive keys. You could type for hours on this thing and not hate yourself (or Samsung). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-hands-on-specs-price-120-hz-140031993.html">battery life </a>is also excellent, so you won’t need to worry about staying close to an outlet. The main caveat is that Android isn’t great as a desktop OS and, while Samsung’s DeX mode offers a somewhat workable solution, it has plenty of quirks. Still, with Android 12L on the horizon, a simple software update could ease some pain.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/32jotag" id="7c4da650d1604f09851af931cbef458e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Tab S7+ at Samsung - $849</a><h2>Best Chrome OS option: HP Chromebook x2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="46699dc1-436f-320f-844c-75a7f6cc25a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Android might suck as a desktop operating system, but Chrome OS doesn’t.

The developer has <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/introducing-fortnite-party-worlds">introduced</a><em>Fortnite</em> Party Worlds, or maps that are solely intended as social spaces to meet friends and play mini games.

At the same time, this shows how far <em>Fortnite</em> has shifted away from its original focuses on battle royale and co-op gaming — there are now islands devoted solely to making friends, not to mention other non-combat experiences like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-mlk-march-through-time-digital-exhibit-162446669.html">virtual museums</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-18-fortnite-world-cup-creative-competition.html">trial courses</a>.

The company has announced that it&#39;s acquiring the team behind Lowkey, an app you can use to easily capture and share gameplay moments. While you can use any screen capture application — or even your phone&#39;s built-in feature — to record your games, Lowkey was designed with casual gamers or those who don&#39;t want to spend time editing their videos in mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The app can capture videos on your computer, for instance, and sync them with your phone where you can use its simple editing tools to create short clips optimized for mobile viewing. You&#39;re also able to share those clips with friends within the app Snapchat-style or publish it for public viewing like TikTok. Niantic didn&#39;t reveal what the Lowkey team will be doing for its AR games and experiences exactly, but it said the team&#39;s &quot;leadership in this space will accelerate the social experiences [it&#39;s] building in [its] products.&quot; The company added: &quot;We share a common vision for building community around shared experiences, and enabling new ways to connect and play for our explorers.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Pokémon Go</em> creator purchased other companies in the past in its quest to build more tools and features for its augmented reality products.
