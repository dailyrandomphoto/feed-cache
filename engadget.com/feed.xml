According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the Japanese conglomerate has stopped the robot&#39;s production last year and is slashing jobs across robotics-related businesses in several countries. Apparently, there wasn&#39;t much demand for Pepper, and SoftBank only ever produced 27,000 units manufactured by Foxconn.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/SoftBank-stops-making-Pepper-robot-but-says-it-isn-t-dead"><em>Nikkei</em></a> has also reported that Pepper&#39;s production was halted due to weak demand, but the SoftBank rep it talked to denied that the company is killing the robot entirely. &quot;We plan to resume production if demand recovers,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Pepper <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-22-softbanks-cutesy-pepper-robot-sells-out-in-one-minute.html">sold out</a> in under a minute when it was released in Japan in 2015, the company only produced 1,000 machines for its consumer launch. Pepper was built as a social robot that can recognize faces and basic human emotions, so it can interact with people. Most of the units SoftBank produced are leased to corporate clients, and the company also placed the robot in its mobile phone stores in Japan.</p><p>With a price of over $1,600, though, Pepper a bit too expensive for most developers and small businesses. <em>Reuters</em>&#39; sources said its sales suffered from limited functionality and unreliability. Further, SoftBank wasn&#39;t able to give the robot more features, because culture clashes between its French business in charge of robotics projects and its Tokyo management reportedly affected Pepper&#39;s development.&nbsp;</p><p>After SoftBank shifted its focus to the cleaning robot Whiz, Pepper was sidelined. The company plans to cut about half of its 330 staff positions in France in September, <em>Reuters</em> said, and half of the sales staff positions in the US and Britain had already been cut.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/softbank-stopped-production-pepper-robots-032616568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">606f21aa-980f-4020-80de-f19d1e2ab266</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 03:26:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624937164</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T03:26:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tatiana Dyuvbanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prague, Czech republic - February 1, 2019: The Robot consultant with digital tablet in Prague airport in Czech republic.

In a new&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/28/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements/">blog post</a>, the company has outlined its reasons for doing that, and it comes down to a desire on Microsoft&#39;s part to get a better idea of what systems can run Windows 11.</p><p>&quot;By providing preview builds to the diverse systems in our Windows Insider Program, we will learn how Windows 11 performs across CPU models more comprehensively, informing any adjustments we should make to our minimum system requirements in the future,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft says its &quot;confident&quot; PCs with 8th-generation Intel and AMD Zen 2 processors will meet the security, reliability and compatibility standards it plans to set with Windows 11.

The judge noted that the FTC can file an amended complaint in the next 30 days.</p><p>But Judge James Boasberg said that the FTC would need to provide more evidence to back up its claims that Facebook is a monopoly. “The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims — namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services,” Boasberg wrote. “The Complaint contains nothing on that score save the naked allegation that the company has had and still has a ‘dominant share of th[at] market (in excess of 60%).’”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, Judge Boasberg also <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/QXUUWZI/STATE_OF_NEW_YORK_et_al_v_FACEBOOK_INC__dcdce-20-03589__0137.0.pdf?mcid=tGE3TEOA">dismissed</a> the antitrust lawsuit against Facebook filed by attorneys general from 48 states and territories.

The cases also cited Facebook’s dealings with competitors like Snapchat and Vine.</p><p>The dismissals are a notable victory for Facebook, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-wants-ftc-antitrust-charges-dismissed-184432839.html">had argued </a>that neither the states or the FTC had a credible antitrust case. The social network had accused the FTC of seeking a “do-over” for acquisitions it had previously approved. In response to the FTC suit, the judge noted the agency “is on firmer ground in scrutinizing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.”</p><p>It’s not yet clear how the FTC will respond, but it’s hardly the end of Facebook’s antitrust woes. Congress recently introduced v, including one that would target major acquisitions like Facebook’s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram. The company is also facing antitrust investigations by regulators in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-antitrust-investigation-uk-report-213356499.html">the UK</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-facebook-antitrust-probe-105245913.html">European Union</a>.</p><p><strong>Update 6/28 4:55pm ET:</strong> In a <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1409611408371859459">statement</a>, Facebook said it was &quot;pleased&quot; with the judge&#39;s decisions. &quot;We are pleased that today&#39;s decisions recognize the defects in the government complaints filed against Facebook.

As far as recent computer advances go, it&#39;s one of the more noticeable upgrades you can get since they help make every interaction, including scrolling, look and feel significantly smoother. But turning up the refresh rate on your laptop&#39;s display is also a major battery drain. You can get the best of both worlds by manually switching between different refresh rates, but that&#39;s time-consuming to do and so Microsoft is introducing a new feature called&nbsp;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic refresh rate</a>&nbsp;(DRR) with the first Windows 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-insider-preview-170004505.html">Insider preview</a></p><p>As the name suggests, DRR will lower your laptop&#39;s refresh rate to 60Hz when you&#39;re doing things like writing emails and documents and then increase it to 120Hz when inking and scrolling so that those interactions feel more instantaneous. As of today, support for the feature is mainly limited to a handful of apps from Microsoft and Adobe. For instance, your computer&#39;s refresh rate will increase to a faster refresh rate when you&#39;re inking and scrolling in Office. However, Microsoft says more apps will support the feature over time. One thing to note is DDR won&#39;t turn on while you&#39;re playing a game, so no need to worry about putting you at a disadvantage in a competitve multiplayer match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To try out DRR, you&#39;ll need a laptop that features a display with support for a variable refresh rate of at least 120Hz. You&#39;ll also need a graphics driver that supports the feature. As such, even if you have a laptop that meets the above requirements, you may not be able to enable DRR after installing the first Windows 11 Insider build. That&#39;s something Microsoft says it&#39;s working with manufacturers to address. But if your laptop has the necessary driver support, you&#39;ll find the option to turn on DRR in the Systems menu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-191145232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc44ecd2-b1aa-47b9-af52-64d6161ef461</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:11:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624907510</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T19:12:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senator proposes law to safeguard journalists’ data from the government]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/press-shield-law-ron-wyden/2021/06/28/ddc7acd0-d808-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">proposed a new bill</a>, called the Protect Reporters from Excessive State Suppression (PRESS) Act, that would protect journalists’ data records from being seized by the government. This comes several months after the Justice Department <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-justice-dept-seized-post-reporters-phone-records/2021/05/07/933cdfc6-af5b-11eb-b476-c3b287e52a01_story.html">admitted that it acquired phone and email records</a> from reporters at <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>CNN</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> in order to identify sources.</p><p>Wyden said in a statement that there needed to be rules “protecting reporters from government surveillance” and that it should be “written into black-letter law.” He said: “The Trump administration spied on reporters it suspected of no crimes in its hunt to identify their sources and prevent the American people from learning the truth about Trump’s lawlessness and corruption.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even though Biden’s DOJ had initially defended the use of subpoenas, the president soon said it was wrong, putting a stop to the practice. Attorney General Merrick Garland had also requested new rules be put in place around cases involving reporters. He also met with executives from the aforementioned three news organizations to discuss the situation.</p><p>While most states have some form of shield law for reporters, the federal government does not. One of the problems with prior attempts at this legislation had to do with how a journalist is defined plus what kind of activities should be protected. A federal law, for example, would have to figure out how to safeguard journalist’s privacy while also protecting national security interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyden’s bill proposes that journalists be shielded from court-ordered disclosures of sources, but allows for exceptions if the information would prevent terrorism, identify terrorists, or if it would prevent violence or death.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senator-proposes-federal-shield-law-183325202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd69b229-e20d-4895-80ea-f3c6dfd0b72b</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 18:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624905152</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T18:32:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6eb771a0-d83e-11eb-bfe7-51d157de54f0" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get up to 25 courses on how to code in different languages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to program isn’t a straightforward process, and it certainly can’t be mastered overnight.

As with past Nier titles, it looks like the gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>will sometimes shift between different perspectives. While developed by Applibot, a Japanese developer best known for mobile games like&nbsp;<em>Grimoire A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>features contributions from those most closely associated with the series, including Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe.

This software will run on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">the new Wear OS, which the company co-developed with Google</a>. Those who follow Samsung closely will remember a version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-19-samsung-one-ui-update-for-older-smartwatches.html">One UI already exists for watches</a> — it&#39;s meant to make the interface between Galaxy phones and watches feel more coherent. From what we saw today, it appears the latest One UI for Wear OS will attempt to do that too. In <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/">a press release</a>, the company said &quot;One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience.&quot;</p><p>When Google announced the latest wearable platform was made in collaboration with Samsung, it shared how it learned from the Korean company how to optimize certain processes for better responsiveness and battery performance. We also saw some changes to navigation, like a double click of a physical button to switch between running apps. But we have yet to get a full breakdown of the updated OS.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Today, Samsung showed a few more details on how things will work. For example, when you install compatible apps on your phone, they&#39;ll also be downloaded onto your smartwatch. Settings from your phone will also port over to your wrist — the various clocks for different cities you&#39;ve picked will show up, while the numbers you&#39;ve blocked will remain blocked. This also works the other way around, so if you block a person from your watch, they&#39;ll also get blacklisted on your Galaxy phones. According to a video of the new UI, the layout of the watch&#39;s Settings menu will also &quot;closely reflect&quot; that on your phone.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c429ed80-d81f-11eb-b77d-e728dadefc3b" alt="A screenshot showing the new Samsung One UI Watch experience based on Wear OS." data-uuid="65b61e01-0a7d-35c4-b776-f9bd468405ac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>One of Tizen&#39;s shortcomings was a lack of third-party app support, and with the new Wear OS that opens up a whole new library of titles you can install. One UI Watch will offer the Google Play Store so you can get apps directly from your wearable. Some of the apps this brings include Couch25K, Facer, Adidas, GolfBuddy, Calm, as well as Google&#39;s apps like Maps, Messages, YouTube Music and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung and Google both also said there will be a new watch face design tool for Android developers to create more useful options that better display the data their users want at a glance.</p><p>While this is by no means an exhaustive look at the new Wear OS or One UI Watch, it gives us a better idea of what to expect. To fully experience the software, though, we&#39;ll have to wait till it rolls out to the public (or when devices ship with it) to not only see what it&#39;s like but also if it truly delivers the performance benefits that both companies have promised.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="74f49428-630c-4939-8e9d-0881cfe3ad4f"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-watch-wear-os-details-171505347.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">684332b6-2dd9-4667-96ec-cb2efe73d0f2</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624908629</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T19:36:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c42a1490-d81f-11eb-b3de-38151b0a8777" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c42a1490-d81f-11eb-b3de-38151b0a8777" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung (Screenshot)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot showing the new Samsung One UI Watch experience based on Wear OS.

The build will show off the operating system&#39;s refined interface, with a centered taskbar and redesigned Start menu, as well as its improved window management. But you&#39;ll have to wait a bit for some of the more advanced features, like the integrated Microsoft Teams chat and Android app compatibility. To try out the Windows 11 preview build, you can <a href="https://insider.windows.com/">sign up on the web </a>or from the &quot;Windows Insider Program&quot; section in Windows 10&#39;s settings.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll have to make sure your PC <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/">meets the Windows 11 minimum hardware requirements</a> to test the preview build, naturally.

The state will use the money to fund programs that prevent e-cigarette addition and to help people quit e-cigarettes. The cash will also finance research into e-cigarettes.</p><p>As part of the <a href="https://ncdoj.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Juul-consent-order.pdf"><ins>consent order</ins></a>, Juul denied any liability or wrongdoing. However, it agreed to a number of changes to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-juul-e-cigarette-point-of-sale-age-verification.html"><ins>business practices</ins></a> in the state. Most social media and influencer advertising are off limits, and the company can&#39;t have ads near schools or sponsor concerts or sporting events. Juul and retailers that sell its products online will need to use an independent verification system to make sure customers are of legal age.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Juul will need to run a secret shopper program to make sure retailers aren&#39;t selling its vape pens to anyone under the age of 21. Retailers will need to keep Juul products behind their counter too. In addition, the company can&#39;t introduce new flavors or change nicotine content levels without approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&nbsp;</p><p>“For years, Juul targeted young people, including teens, with its highly addictive e-cigarette. It lit the spark and fanned the flames of a vaping epidemic among our children – one that you can see in any high school in North Carolina,&quot; North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said <a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"><ins>in a statement</ins></a>. “This win will go a long way in keeping Juul products out of kids’ hands, keeping its chemical vapor out of their lungs, and keeping its nicotine from poisoning and addicting their brains.&quot;</p><p>A Juul spokesperson sent the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers. Importantly, we look forward to working with Attorney General Stein and other manufacturers on the development of potential industry-wide marketing practices based on science and evidence. In addition, we support the Attorney General’s desire to deploy funds to generate appropriate science to support North Carolina’s public health interventions to reduce underage use.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We seek to continue to earn trust through action. Over the past two years, for example, we ceased the distribution of our non-tobacco, non-menthol flavored products in advance of FDA guidance and halted all mass market product advertising. This settlement is another step in that direction.</p></blockquote><p>Stein started investigating Juul in 2018 and sued the company the following year for &quot;designing, marketing, and selling its e-cigarettes to attract young people and for misrepresenting the potency and danger of nicotine in its products.&quot; More than a dozen other states have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-19-juul-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general.html"><ins>sued Juul</ins></a> for similar reasons, though the North Carolina case is the first to reach a resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-ftc-lawsuit-juul.html"><ins>filed a lawsuit</ins></a> against Juul, Marlboro owner Altria and others with the aim of undoing a 2018 investment that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-20-juul-altria-investment-vaping-big-tobacco.html"><ins>gave Altria a 35 percent stake</ins></a> in the vape pen maker. The agency argues that agreements between the two companies stifled competition and violated antitrust laws. Meanwhile, the FDA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-fda-vaping-criminal-investigation.html"><ins>opened</ins></a> a criminal investigation into vaping in 2019.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/juul-north-carolina-settlement-vaping-teens-163805341.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6700c273-8094-45fe-b7d5-a7eb9749fb2a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 16:38:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624898293</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T16:38:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bcea6d20-d82d-11eb-a767-f0a577764f2d" width="5036" height="3357" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bcea6d20-d82d-11eb-a767-f0a577764f2d" width="5036" height="3357" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shopkeepers stand inside a Juul shop at a shopping mall in Jakarta, Indonesia, December 30, 2019.

Just four months later, with the pandemic subsiding, the Google-owned video platform is now embracing live entertainment like never before. YouTube has partnered with Hollywood Park, a near 300-acre mega development in Inglewood, California, to host a massive live venue.&nbsp;</p><p>The &quot;YouTube Theater&quot; will be a three-story, 6,000 seater arena for performances that range from traditional concerts to the type of events you&#39;d associate with its namesake. Think eSports and creator and community shows for the site&#39;s dedicated contingent of gamers and vloggers. Maybe the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers — whose 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium is in the same complex — will also drop in.

Construction on the theater is scheduled to be completed this summer.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be a YouTube event without some social interaction. In that vein, the venue will feature a massive exterior screen that guests can mirror themselves on and view clips through. Google could also use it to highlight the same products it sells at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-store-nyc-chelsea-open-tour-140001787.html">newly opened debut retail store</a> in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube isn&#39;t the first video service to broach live events, though the scale here may be unmatched by its closest rivals.

YouTube committed to fixing that in a blog post <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/">earlier this year</a>, and now the company is making good on its promise. Starting today, YouTube TV will have a new add-on called &quot;4K Plus.&quot; As the name suggests, it&#39;ll enable 4K streaming, assuming you have a compatible TV and streaming device. The 4K Plus add-on also includes the ability to download recordings from your DVR to a phone or tablet, a feature that should be pretty useful for people as they start traveling more this summer.</p><p>4K Plus also lets you stream YouTube TV from &quot;unlimited&quot; devices when you&#39;re at home. The basic YouTube TV package can stream on three different devices simultaneously, but if you have a large household relying exclusively on the service, this should make sure no one gets locked out.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unfortunately, this all comes at a fairy steep cost. The 4K Plus add-on costs $19.99 per month, on top of whatever your existing YouTube TV plan costs. (Right now, the basic YouTube TV plan starts at $64.99 a month.) The price of YouTube TV has risen significantly over the past few years, and now if you want 4K, you&#39;re easily in the same realm as a comprehensive cable TV package. YouTube TV may have its own benefits over traditional cable, but pricing sadly is not one of them.</p><p>That said, if you act quickly, you can get a price deal on 4K Plus — YouTube is offering a one-month free trial to new users, after which you can sign up for $9.99 per month, a pretty good deal over the standard price.&nbsp;</p><p>The good news is that everyone using YouTube TV is also getting an upgrade in the audio department, as the service will soon support 5.1 Dolby audio, regardless of what plan you&#39;re on. There aren&#39;t a lot of details about how it&#39;ll work, though — YouTube says it&#39;ll &quot;start rolling out to select devices over the coming weeks,&quot; but we don&#39;t know exactly what devices they&#39;re talking about.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">111eaceb-cb3e-4d24-bb57-b30c3ee75b39</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 16:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624890811</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T14:33:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/a8240970-d81c-11eb-bdff-c37091cb12b1" width="3918" height="2939" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/a8240970-d81c-11eb-bdff-c37091cb12b1" width="3918" height="2939" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Icon Sportswire via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, WA - APRIL 06: A view of the YouTube TV logo before the MLS regular season match between Real Salt Lake and Seattle Sounders on April 06, 2019, at CenturyLink Field in Seattle, WA.

For years, my primary pair of headphones were just the wired earbuds that came with my phone. I’m hard-pressed to tell the difference between MP3 and FLAC. Yet, I recently bought a <a href="https://uturnaudio.com/products/orbit-plus-turntable">U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus</a> turntable, a pair of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Kanto YU4" href="https://fave.co/2U25rnP">Kanto YU4</a> speakers and several vinyl records on eBay. How did this happen?</p><p>It all began nearly a decade ago when I joined a They Might Be Giants fan club. For an annual fee, the band would send members not just bumper stickers and t-shirts, but also several 7-inch singles and the occasional 12-inch LP. Two years later and I had accumulated a mini collection of vinyl that I had no way of playing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not wanting to spend a ton of money, I decided to see what the fuss was about and buy a cheap Crosley Cruiser Deluxe (you know, the one in its own suitcase that every late-millennial hipster bought from Target a few years back). I wasn’t expecting much for $50, but somehow it still managed to fall far short of those expectations, with thin and flat audio that sounded bad even to my untrained ears.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ed83b4b0-d796-11eb-bfff-240dac485e61" alt="U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus" data-uuid="cc932e96-b9b6-324d-94cc-304f83ff0994"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>But the experience was strangely charming: It’s hypnotic to set a record on the platter, watch it spin and witness the needle transforming its grooves into sound. Playing a record also reminded me of my childhood, when I would spend hours in my bedroom listening to cassette tapes and CDs, and reading the liner notes. I got lost in the music in a way that random playlists on Spotify can’t quite replicate.</p><p>I looked around for higher-quality turntables, but the only ones I could find at the time were far outside my price range. I was also reluctant to spend more money on extra equipment like amplifiers, preamps and speakers. Plus I wasn’t entirely convinced that my non-audiophile ears would be able to tell the difference between vinyl and digital. It didn’t seem worth it.</p><p>But as time went by, I secretly longed for one. I know it sounds shallow, but to me turntables just look cool. Additionally, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-04-music-streaming-is-fueling-vinyls-resurgence.html">vinyl has undergone a resurgence</a> and it’s not uncommon these days for artists to release special edition LPs with album artwork and bonus tracks that aren&#39;t available elsewhere. Call me pretentious, but the idea of owning something tangible, something beautiful, that also supports an artist I love, really appeals to me.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/06773000-d797-11eb-bfbe-7de07a7cf6bd" alt="Kanto YU4" data-uuid="524104df-90c4-3d8a-becd-b8d7d2f7554d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Then came 2020, and in a fit of quarantine-induced mania, I decided that this was the time to finally give in to the vinyl lust that’s been building all these years. After a copious amount of research that included reading reviews and watching YouTube videos, I chose a setup that could deliver a combination of affordability, design and quality, at least for my tastes and budget.</p><p>I knew right away that I wanted U-Turn Audio’s Orbit Plus ($309) as the turntable. It’s not quite as inexpensive as the company’s own Orbit Basic ($200), but it’s still relatively affordable compared to some of the higher-end turntables on the market. Admittedly, one of my primary reasons for going with U-Turn Audio is the sleek and minimalistic design of the company’s hardware. I opted for the Plus over the Basic because its acrylic platter makes for more consistent speeds. It also comes with the Ortofon OM5E cartridge, which I had read delivers a more neutral, balanced sound.</p><p>As someone who’s never set up a turntable before, I was impressed with how easy the U-Turn Audio was to put together. When I received it, the tonearm and cartridge were already in place. All I had to do was position the platter, the mat and the belt, connect the appropriate plugs, and I was ready to go in a little over five minutes. Plus, changing speeds between 33 rpm and 45 rpm is as easy as slipping the belt into another pulley groove.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1e7771b0-d797-11eb-9ef7-88b7a4ac343e" alt="U Turn Audio Orbit Plus" data-uuid="eb09ac06-9a4e-3cdc-8013-e925cd951f0a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Another thing I like about the Orbit Plus is how customizable it is. It comes in a variety of different eye-catching colors, and I could choose to change out the cartridge for something a little more premium later on if I wanted to. I could also add a built-in phono preamp (which is needed to amplify the signal from the cartridge to your amplifier or speakers) or incorporate a cue lever that lowers and raises the tonearm. Bear in mind that adding these different options (aside from the color change) will cost extra. The addition of the preamp, for example, increases the price of the Orbit Plus to $379.</p><p>I went without a preamp on the Orbit Plus because my choice of speakers are the Kanto YU4s, which already have one built-in. I decided against separate components like an amplifier or a standalone phono preamp because I wanted to keep the setup simple, with as few devices as possible. Powered speakers like the YU4 allow me to do that. In fact, the YU4’s versatility is one of the reasons I like it so much. It has RCA and AUX inputs, optical inputs, a USB charge port, a subwoofer output, plus Bluetooth capabilities. Thanks to the latter feature, I often use the YU4 as computer speakers as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/4426f750-d797-11eb-99ff-8a59037d43b4" alt="U Turn Audio Orbit Plus" data-uuid="fc0fa2ff-6cc9-3e59-a861-23d96c5e5a19"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>What&#39;s more, the YU4s are just so good-looking. It has this modern, minimalist design that I think pairs wonderfully with the Orbit Plus. I currently have the YU4s positioned on either side of it, and I&#39;m very pleased with how it all looks together. On top of that, I found the YU4’s price ($370) quite reasonable as well, especially with all of its features.</p><p>As a self-professed non-audiophile, I found the audio quality of this entire setup to be more than satisfactory. The highs are crisp and the volume is powerful enough to fill the room. The one complaint I would have is that the Kanto YU4’s bass is a little lacking. It’s there, but it just isn’t as thumpy as I would like. Kanto does sell a separate subwoofer for extra bass, but for $300, I think I can live without it.</p><p>Since I’ve purchased the turntable, I’ve spent many evenings sitting in my room listening to entire albums without the distractions from the phone or computer. I even enjoy the ritual of cleaning each record and putting them back in their sleeves. It’s become a form of meditative self-care for me. Is that too precious? Does that make me a hipster? I don’t pretend it isn’t at least a little tiresome. But right now, in the midst of a pandemic, I’ll take any kind of self-care I can get.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-kanto-yu4-irl-150023872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea031a30-69d8-411c-a01b-87ae7e476b00</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:45:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624913561</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T20:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ca566d20-d796-11eb-afd4-50e066717b4e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ca566d20-d796-11eb-afd4-50e066717b4e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[U-Turn Audio Orbit Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Issac Asimov’s 'Foundation' lands on Apple TV+ September 24]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has revealed when you&#39;ll get to watch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-foundation-trailer-184005079.html"><em><ins>Foundation</ins></em></a>, its adaptation of Issac Asimov’s series of sci-fi novels.

You’ll receive vinyls from the likes of Pink Floyd, Aretha Franklin and ABBA, so if you’ve been collecting records for a while or your tastes fall outside of the mainstream, this might not be for you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, as <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/amazon-vinyl-of-the-month-price-music-subscription-1189055/"><em><ins>Rolling Stone</ins></em></a> points out, the subscription can be decent value for money. Amazon quietly rolled out the Vinyl of the Month Club plan over the last few months. In that time, subscribers have received the likes of Pink Floyd’s <em>The Wall</em> and The Clash’s <em>London Calling</em>. Those cost $47 and $32.56 on Amazon respectively, so you’d save a bit. But given the mystery bag format, there’s no telling in advance whether you’ll get an album you actually want.</p><p>You can return a vinyl as long as it’s sealed and unused. If you’re unfamiliar with the artist or album, it’s maybe worth checking it out on a streaming service before tearing the plastic wrapping off. You can also skip a month or cancel at any time. Shipping’s included in the $25/month fee and you don’t need to be a Prime member to sign up.</p><p>Vinyl has steadily grown in popularity again in recent years as more people embrace the classic format. Streaming accounts for the biggest slice of the music industry pie by far, but in 2020, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riaa-music-revenue-report-2020-204907874.html"><ins>vinyl sales grew 29 percent</ins></a> from the previous year to $619.6 million in the US.</p><p>Amazon offers a number of subscriptions, such as Prime Video (which is included with Prime), Amazon Music Unlimited and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audible-cheaper-plan-exclusive-audio-content-170058969.html"><ins>Audible Plus</ins></a>. Given the upswing in interest in vinyl, this seems like a smart way for Amazon to expand its media-centric plans.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-vinyl-of-the-month-club-subscription-141638349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">584555cc-5f02-41bf-9cb3-9906c381bf2a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 14:16:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624889800</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T14:16:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/27001170-d819-11eb-9bef-d697f8b9980f" width="3500" height="2325" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/27001170-d819-11eb-9bef-d697f8b9980f" width="3500" height="2325" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[vovashevchuk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[retro vynil player with disk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[vynil player with disk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Honda's first electric SUV will be called the Prologue]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honda finally has a name for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-electric-suv-models-2024-153757066.html">first electric SUV</a>, not to mention more precise timing. As <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/honda-prologue-electric-suv-announcement/#ftag=CAD590a51e">notes</a>, the automaker has <a href="https://global.honda/newsroom/news/2021/4210628eng.html">revealed</a> that this EV people hauler (not pictured here) will be called the Prologue when it arrives in early 2024.

Qualcomm already has a string of high-profile customers lined up for the Snapdragon 888 Plus, including ASUS&#39; next ROG Phone, Honor&#39;s Magic 3, at least one Motorola device as well as handsets from Vivo and Xiaomi. We also wouldn&#39;t rule out phones from other major customers, such as Samsung&#39;s possible foldable phone updates.</p><p>The first phones using the Snapdragon 888 Plus are due to ship sometime in the third quarter of the year. The improvements won&#39;t have you regretting that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG Phone 5</a> purchase (or any other 888-based phone, really), but they will ensure that Android phones in the back half of 2021 will use Qualcomm&#39;s absolute latest technology.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd9c51ba-737f-4f2b-ad2b-5b6573dc40c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:10:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624884954</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T12:56:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/47a72bb0-d80b-11eb-bbeb-6c699826ab38" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/47a72bb0-d80b-11eb-bbeb-6c699826ab38" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus 5G system on chip]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 Plus 5G system on chip]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix lets Android users watch partially downloaded shows]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can be quite infuriating to find out that you can&#39;t access some episodes and movies you thought you were able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-24-download-netflix-to-your-android-sd-card.html">download</a> on your device after settling in for a long flight.

Today, the company revealed US release dates for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-20-pro-5g-tcl-20l-plus-tcl-20l-cheap-phones-150041628.html">20-series handsets it debuted in Europe</a> in the spring. Alongside the phones, TCL is launching the $100 MoveAudio S600 true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation.</p><p>The headliner here is the $500 TCL 20 Pro 5G (pictured above), which features a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-750-global-5g-ai-echo-cancellation-133000558.html">Snapdragon 750G</a> chipset with 6GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage, expandable to 1TB with a microSD. It offers a 6.67-inch, 20:9 curved AMOLED display with a full HD resolution, while the camera has the same 48-megapixel Sony IMX582 sensor found in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-10-pro-5g-10l-us-price-specs-availability-130011490.html">the TCL 10 Plus</a>. That&#39;s accompanied by a 16-megapixel ultra-wide camera, a 5-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth-sensor, with a 32-megapixel camera at the front. TCL says the phone will work with most GSM networks at launch, and Verizon low-band 5G and 4G in the coming weeks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6e4903c0-d80f-11eb-a277-5a7c6fea6593" style="height:1500;width:2000;" alt="TCL" data-uuid="d6273d8e-b209-39ef-aa62-9447044bc7f5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>Next in line based on price is the $250 TCL 20S (pictured above), essentially a variant of the 20L+ from April. The cheaper handset packs a similar 6.67-inch display, but comes with 128GB of storage (also expandable to 1TB) and 4GB RAM. The Snapdragon 665 chipset here is also not as powerful as the 20 Pro&#39;s 750G. Still, the handset boasts some interesting deviations from its pricier sibling. Chiefly, TCL says this is its first phone with a circular polarized screen, which apparently reduces eye strain by 85 percent and appears natural even when viewed through sunglasses. The 64-megapixel sensor also sounds superior than its sibling&#39;s on paper.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3283a750-d80f-11eb-bcb3-05288e006272" style="height:2000;width:2000;" alt="TCL" data-uuid="069d45a0-be09-3774-995c-17572b45e5d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>Finally, the $190 TCL 20 SE (which won&#39;t win any awards in the title department) understandably has the lowest-specs of the bunch. While it does feature a larger 6.82-inch display, it pairs that with a sub-par 720p resolution. Keeping with the no-frills approach, inside is a Snapdragon 460 chipset, along with 4GB RAM combined with 128GB of storage (which can only be upgraded to 256GB). It also has a 5,000 mAh battery, though you won&#39;t get the same fast-charging tech as on its pricier counterparts. The camera includes a 48-megapixel main snapper, a 5-megapixel wide-angle, a 2-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth cam. There&#39;s also a 13-megapixel selfie taker on the front.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/d129c750-d80e-11eb-bf5d-4584c7911578" style="height:4329;width:3484;" alt="TCL" data-uuid="8eba2081-b8ff-3b06-a89d-b13ea3e63fff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-20-series-phones-us-130019345.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">edd6f0e8-cc11-4b95-8570-63a67910375c</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 13:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624885042</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T12:57:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/d06de6d0-d80d-11eb-b56c-fc3ea2833808" width="2000" height="1218" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/d06de6d0-d80d-11eb-b56c-fc3ea2833808" width="2000" height="1218" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TCL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[tcl]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[tcl]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
