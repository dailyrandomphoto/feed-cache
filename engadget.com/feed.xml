Now, HMD/Nokia have launched their first tablet together, the 10.4-inch T20, with the key features being a large battery, cheap price and US availability.</p><p>The T20 isn&#39;t what you&#39;d call a beautiful tablet, given the plain-Jane design and chunky bezels, though it does have a solid metal body structure and relatively thin (7.8mm) and light (470g) profile. The screen also looks pretty nice on paper, with 2K (2,000 x 1,200) resolution and 400 nits of brightness.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/928f4480-2673-11ec-bfff-de0e1d582fdd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="1a12ef8d-0a13-33b2-a9dc-f570b57f62b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nokia</div></figure><p>The key feature is the battery, though. With an 8,200mAh (non-removable) cell, it will let you surf the web for 15 hours between charges, play video for 10 hours or do Zoom-type calls for seven hours. It also comes with relatively fast charging (15 watts), though the charger in the box outputs just 10 watts.</p><p>Other specs are about what you&#39;d expect for a tablet in this price category, including a Tiger T610 8-core CPU, up to 4GB of RAM/64GB of storage (expandable), and an 8-megapixel rear camera/5-megapixel front camera. There&#39;s optional LTE as well, though Nokia didn&#39;t say how much extra that would cost.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a8f11870-2673-11ec-a5ef-5b909e84030f" style="height:1337;width:2000;" alt="HMD and Nokia&#39;s first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250" data-uuid="95bdb032-2841-3d76-abf0-8548df3ff479"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Giacomo Mantovani</div></figure><p>For what it is, $250 price looks pretty decent. However, the world of Android tablets is an unremarkable one — will Nokia&#39;s brand recognition matter? The Nokia T20 arrives to the US and elsewhere around the world tomorrow (October 7th).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hmd-and-nokias-first-tablet-has-a-humongous-battery-090021037.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">302cb242-7577-4ca6-b4a4-8c20806570fb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 09:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633504221</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T07:10:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ed3eaf0-266b-11ec-8f8e-c7ce669cf2a1" width="2000" height="1319" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ed3eaf0-266b-11ec-8f8e-c7ce669cf2a1" width="2000" height="1319" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HMD]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HMD and Nokia's first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HMD and Nokia's first tablet has a humongous battery and costs $250]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile wireless home internet service now costs $10 less]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile has <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/home-internet-big-fee-deal">slashed</a> $10 off the wireless home internet service it launched in April. From $60, it now costs $50 a month, which is the same price it charged customers during the product&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-home-internet-expansion-130-cities-161542128.html">pilot program</a> that started back in 2019. The service gives customers access to a gateway router/modem device that converts T-Mobile&#39;s 4G LTE and 5G networks into WiFi with typical download speeds of 35 to 115 Mbps. It has no annual contract, no data caps and, as the carrier keeps repeating in its announcement, no hidden fees and charges.</p><p>That $50 a month includes taxes and rental for the gateway, which customers have to return if they decide to cancel. They&#39;d have to install it themselves, but the carrier says it will take them as little as 15 minutes. T-Mobile started testing the wireless home internet service in rural and underserved areas a couple of years ago in an invite-only trial for 50,000 homes. It rolled out access to the pilot program to over 130 cities across the US before the service&#39;s official launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those interested will have to take note, however, that the price only applies if they pay via AutoPay.

That’s changing in the coming months with the introduction of a feature called <a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/3-new-ways-navigate-more-sustainably-maps"><ins>lite navigation</ins></a>. Taking the turn-by-turn functionality that Maps is known for, the tool allows you to see important details about your current trip without the need to keep your phone’s screen turned on. You also don’t need to enter the full turn-by-turn interface to use the feature. At a glance, it will also allow you to see your current ETA and any changes in elevation.</p><p>Google announced the introduction of lite navigation as part of a broader effort related to sustainability. So as you might imagine, it’s not the only cycling-related announcement the company had. It also shared that information related to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-google-maps-bike-sharing.html"><ins>bike and scooter sharing</ins></a> is available in 300 cities globally.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b7ebcf20-2626-11ec-ae9c-b1d97eb40feb" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Google Maps eco-friendly routing" data-uuid="90059271-4e26-3674-b46a-9b963da0daff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>For those that still depend on their car, eco-friendly car routing, which Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-indoor-live-view-eco-friendly-routes-pickup-and-delivery-integration-100020907.html"><ins>announced at the end of March</ins></a>, is now available in the US. With today’s rollout, Maps will display the most fuel-efficient route you can take to a destination, in addition to the fastest one as it has always done. The tool will also display your relative fuel savings should you decide to follow the more efficient route. Google estimates the feature may help prevent as much as 1 million tons of carbon emissions from entering the atmosphere. That’s about the equivalent of removing 200,000 cars from the road. The company expects to roll out eco-friendly routing to European countries sometime in 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-lite-navigation-cycling-070152299.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">984d5368-28c5-441b-b0d1-b785b0aa8027</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633471879</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T22:11:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eef86900-2627-11ec-b775-d25d549854c9" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eef86900-2627-11ec-b775-d25d549854c9" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[lite navigation still]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[lite navigation still]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google turns its AI on traffic lights to reduce pollution]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Poorly timed traffic lights don&#39;t just waste precious minutes. Like Google&#39;s chief sustainability officer Kate Brandt pointed out at a media event yesterday, they&#39;re also bad for the environment and public health. The company unveiled a slew of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html">sustainability-centric products</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-sustainability-travel-shopping-070110212.html">updates today</a> that aim to help users make more informed, environmentally friendly decisions. But it&#39;s also been working on a project that could use AI to make traffic lights more efficient and, as a result, decrease pollution in general.&nbsp;</p><p>When your vehicle stops at an intersection, that idling time leads to wasted fuel and &quot;more street-level air pollution,&quot; Brandt said. Google&#39;s new project would use AI to measure and calculate traffic conditions and timing at a city&#39;s intersections, then time them more efficiently. Brandt said one of the company&#39;s AI research groups has been able to accurately calculate and gather this data and train a model to optimize inefficient intersections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google has run pilots at four locations in Israel to date, in partnership with the municipalities of Haifa, Beer-Sheva and the Israel National Roads Company. The company says it&#39;s observed a &quot;10 to 20 percent reduction in fuel and intersection delay time&quot; so far. Google didn&#39;t share any details on the average daily traffic in those intersections, though a video clip from the event showed a fairly busy junction. The company also didn&#39;t explain how the AI would work with current systems and the lights around specific intersections.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s early days,&quot; Brandt said, &quot;but on the back of these promising results, we are now beginning new pilots in Rio de Janeiro and speaking with other cities around the globe.&quot; Though we&#39;re likely still at least years away from having AI manage <a href="https://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/12/engineers-who-hacked-in-la-traffic-signal-computers-jamming-traffic-sentenced.html">our traffic intersections</a>, this is one of the steps towards the vision of completely smart cities that the industry has collectively been working on for years.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of letting AI decide when to let vehicles stop or go can seem unsettling at best and potentially risky, but the goal of improving traffic light efficiency is a worthwhile one. Hopefully, with rigorous testing and safety measures in place, we may actually be able to reduce a significant amount of wasted fuel and exhaust-based pollution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-traffic-lights-research-environment-pollution-070132356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38eee67a-2d14-4c53-a3b5-8f5369e5b285</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633469840</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T21:37:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef0aa030-2621-11ec-bfff-e905038a4337" width="2216" height="1223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration demonstrating how Google's AI could optimize traffic lights at an intersection.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google AI Traffic Light research project]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest Renew program can help you use more clean energy at home]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s latest effort to help you make more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-minecraft-sustainability-report-map-154637717.html">environmentally friendly</a> decisions is all about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-texas-storm-power-grid-133029237.html">your power grid</a>. The <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/nest-renew-clean-energy/">new Nest Renew program</a> is a suite of features that look at the times of day when the electricity feeding into your home is cleaner and turning your compatible Nest thermostats on or off accordingly. Renew arrives in a by-invitation preview in the coming weeks, and will be available for free in the continental US when it launches publicly.&nbsp;</p><p>At the heart of Nest Renew is the understanding that at any given time, the power grid in your neighborhood contains a mix of clean and traditional energy. In the early afternoon, perhaps, there could be a higher concentration of electricity from solar sources, while a windier day could mean more power from turbines is coming through. Depending on the region, power grids could be getting their electricity from a diverse mix of sources. According to Nest product manager Jeff Gleeson, &quot;a smart dynamic electric grid really needs smart homes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nest Renew will not only automate some of this decision-making for you, but it can also give you insights on the type of power coming into your home. First, a new feature called Energy Shift will let those with a Google account and compatible Nest Thermostat automatically activate heating or cooling during times when your grid is cleaner.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f764610-2616-11ec-9eff-db5273d5851a" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="A sample of the Monthly Impact Report from Google&#39;s new Nest Renew Program on a laptop screen." data-uuid="89dc9725-ea94-3e77-a3d1-19943326816e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Because Google can now see how carbon-intense a grid is, it can start cooling, say, earlier in the day when solar energy is more available (and your home is approaching your temperature limit). Gleeson told Engadget that the company doesn&#39;t think people will notice a difference with this change, and stresses that &quot;customers are always in control.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>If your thermostat kicks in before you want it to, you can always dial it back down, and you&#39;ll know the device is making a Renew-related decision thanks to a green leaf that will appear onscreen. For those whose energy provider charges based on time-of-use, this can also help you save money.</p><p>Nest has had the leaf symbol on its product for years as an indicator of more power-efficient temperature control. Now, you can earn leafs by doing things like using Energy Shift, joining monthly challenges to do things like running your laundry on cold. When you accumulate enough leafs to hit milestones, you can vote where Google sends its funds (from a list of its Energy Impact partners starting with non-profits <a href="https://gridalternatives.org/">GRID Alternatives</a> and <a href="https://www.elevatenp.org/">Elevate</a>).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e5f4270-2617-11ec-bbfb-c3e15b488e17" style="height:2000;width:2000;" alt="A Nest Thermostat showing the message " data-uuid="5da1ee04-4396-36b2-9fd7-fa93c2147b7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In addition to automatic adjustments via your thermostat, Nest Renew will provide monthly &quot;impact reports&quot; that not only tell you the difference you&#39;re making, but also display when the electricity coming into your home is greener. With this data, you can choose to run the laundry, dishwasher or charge your devices earlier or later when your grid is cleaner.</p><p>Renew is a free opt-in program and works with the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-31-nest-thermostat-e.html">Nest Thermostat E</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-thermostat-2020-redesign-google-home-130-specs-pre-order-140039186.html">most recent Nest Thermostat</a>. Google is also offering a Premium tier for $10 a month in select parts of the US. It will unlock a Clean Energy Match feature that will exchange renewable energy credits (RECs) for what it estimates to be the same amount of fossil fuel-based electricity you use at home each month. This way, even if clean energy isn&#39;t available when you need to use it, you can at least assuage your guilt over using non-renewable power. Premium members will also get a unified bill that shows their monthly subscription to the program as well as their usual utility charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Gleeson said Nest has been working on this program for years, and in that time it has teamed up with utilities and energy providers to encourage enrollment in residential programs, among other things. For Nest Renew, it&#39;s teamed up with eight <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/a-glimpse-into-the-derms-vendor-ecosystem-and-solutions">Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS)</a> providers to help shape the program to meet their respective zero-carbon goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the Nest Thermostats, increased visibility and marketing and relevant rewards programs, Google hopes to get more people enrolled  in green energy utilities offers and programs. The company also wants to help utilities &quot;bring more renewables online&quot; and accelerate the process either by supporting them in building or buying renewable infrastructure, according to head of energy partnerships Hannah Bascomb.</p><p>Google&#39;s slew of sustainability-minded announcements today demonstrate a continued commitment towards the &quot;carbon-free future&quot; that CEO Sundar Pichai wrote about <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/our-third-decade-climate-action-realizing-carbon-free-future/">a year ago</a>. In what Pichai called &quot;our third decade of climate action,&quot; Google plans to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7, help more than 500 cities reduce 1 gigaton of carbon emissions and enable its partners to reduce carbon emissions all by 2030. Nest Renew is a part of a wide-ranging set of updates today across Search, Maps and more to help Google&#39;s users make more-informed, environmentally friendly decisions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-renew-clean-energy-program-070131398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74bad9e0-cc4a-4976-a457-6b8aa73fbabe</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 07:01:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633466210</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T20:36:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0ac91d00-260f-11ec-b9f7-93d0123431e2" width="3767" height="2690" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person using their right index finger to adjust the temperature on a Nest Thermostat, which shows the temperature at 74 degrees on its screen.

The internet giant is updating its search to provide information on more sustainable shopping and travel options. Look for energy-intensive appliances like hot water heaters or dishwashers, for instance, and you&#39;ll see suggestions for more sustainable (and frequently more cost-effective) products. A future update will also make it easier to cross-shop electric and hybrid cars, complete with identifying tags and a view of nearby compatible charging stations.</p><p>Google Flights, meanwhile, <a href="https://blog.google/products/travel/find-flights-with-lower-carbon-emissions">will show</a> the estimated CO2 emissions for &quot;nearly every&quot; flight, right down to the seat level.

Its aim is nothing less than to transform virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) production by making workflow simpler than current VR capture systems, while delivering the quality of a full-frame mirrorless camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The key product is the $1,999 RF5.2mm F2.8 L Dual Fisheye manual lens designed specifically to mount on Canon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">8K-capable EOS R5</a> camera. It&#39;s a highly unusual looking product, to say the least, with two bulging fisheye lenses mounted side by side. They&#39;re placed approximately 60mm (24 inches) apart to match human interpupillary distance and provide comfortable parallax for VR and AR.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/aa5daa20-265a-11ec-9dde-f26d15ab7d47" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a58436c1-ff22-3d47-ba29-b503f8e8749f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens works only with Canon&#39;s EOS R5, chosen for its 8K video capability. When shooting, it projects two circular images onto the camera&#39;s 45-megapixel sensor. It supports 190-degree capture, allowing for delivery of stereoscopic 180-degree 3D footage or photos at up to 8,192 x 4,096 (8K) resolution for AR or VR applications.&nbsp;</p><p>The lens has some unusual features, like a ring that focuses both lenses at once and an Allen screw adjustment that lets you tweak the focus of one lens to precisely match the other. Otherwise, you get features typically found in high-end Canon L RF mount glass, like coatings to control flare and ghosting, dust and water-resistant sealing and a solid F2.8 to F16 aperture range. Despite the odd looks, the lens is fairly compact and not much larger than Canon&#39;s 35mm F1.8 lens.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68668a40-265c-11ec-bcd7-232376631f48" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system" data-uuid="bf7dbb3d-bb68-3e8d-a249-a88954385a5c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The lens is just one part of the equation, though. Canon is working on a firmware update for the R5 with new features to support the lens and EOS VR system. That includes MF peaking and manual focus confirm via Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel autofocus system, along with a &quot;Magic Window&quot; UI that helps users plan for delivery to different types of headsets.</p><p>In addition, Canon made its own EOS VR Utility and EOS VR Plugin apps, each available by subscription for $5 per month (with a free trial period). The VR Utility app flips the stereo images left to right and converts them from circular to an &quot;equirectangular&quot; square image that can be viewed on a VR headset. It also offers quick editing tools like trimming of clips and application of a LUT, while letting you change to preset resolutions and file types (DPX, Pro Res, H264, etc.) prior to export.</p><div id="6df67d3f53124c17a9e391b2e55bc302"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OJAr7SbVGBg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There&#39;s also the EOS VR plug-in for Adobe Premiere that &quot;will convert the dual fisheye imagery to equirectangular, while allowing the ability to cut, color, and edit with the full control of Premiere Pro,&quot; Canon told Engadget. It also lets you export footage to the desired spec for different types of delivery.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of those apps, you&#39;ll be able to use the current Camera Connect app and Canon&#39;s EOS Utility to control capture. Both will be updated down the road to offer &quot;remote control live view functionality for monitoring purposes while on-the-go,&quot; Canon said in a <a href="https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/20211006-product/20211006-product">press release</a>.</p><p>The system can be used for weddings, journalism, sports, training, events and more, while offering a number of advantages over current VR cameras. To start with, it&#39;s designed to deliver better quality than standalone VR cameras with smaller lenses and sensors like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-21-insta360-pro-2-8k-3d-vr-flowstate-stabilization.html">$5,000 Insta360 Pro 2</a>. At the same time, you get all the R5&#39;s tools like log shooting, RAW capture, 10-bit video and more. And when you&#39;re not using the VR lens, the R5 can be used for regular video production or photo shoots, unlike dedicated VR cameras.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/768e1d60-265a-11ec-a57f-7e26368f01f2" alt="Canon created a dual fisheye lens for a new VR video system" data-uuid="a37a1b52-d134-3e8a-80aa-578b74ea69ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>At the same, the production process is simpler and cheaper than with dual cameras used in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-live-nba-is-coming-to-googles-vr-platform.html">higher-end productions</a>. Those cameras must be rigged, synced, focused and positioned correctly, with the end result being two files in many cases. Canon&#39;s EOS VR system, by contrast, delivers similar quality but offers focus and setup like a regular camera, while leaving you with a single file to edit at the end.&nbsp;</p><p>The entire system isn&#39;t exactly cheap, considering you need to pay $1,999 for the lens and $3,899 if you don&#39;t already have an R5 camera, for a total of $5,898. However, considering how niche and unusual the lens is, it costs less than I expected. There&#39;s also the issue of R5 overheating that limits 8K recording times to 20 minutes, with a 10-minute recovery period. You can <a href="https://ymcinema.com/2021/08/29/canon-eos-r5-overheating-test-passed-more-than-1-5-hours-of-8k-raw-recording-time/">improve that</a> by capturing 8K to an external Ninja V+ RAW recorder, but that&#39;ll add $1,500 to your cost.</p><p>Still, it looks very promising for VR production, which has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/04/virtual-reality-usage-booms-in-the-workplace-amid-the-pandemic.html">boomed in popularity</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic (though still isn&#39;t exactly mainstream). It&#39;s been especially in-demand for business training and collaboration, a potentially rich vein for video producers. A lot of those folks, especially if they already have a Canon EOS R5, might be willing to jump into VR work if Canon&#39;s new system is as easy to use as it promises. The lens and EOS VR system are set to arrive in late December 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-introduces-its-new-vr-system-with-a-dual-fisheye-lens-040837782.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e38cab3-7d65-4227-8750-9ff89d80da2d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 04:08:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633496225</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T04:57:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3515aa0-265b-11ec-bbfe-c1cc52ba2922" width="2000" height="1293" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon created a dual fisheye lens for its new VR video system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former Sennheiser engineer Axel Grell made a $200 pair of ANC true wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Axel Grell, the designer of Sennheiser’s legendary HD580 and HD800 headphones, left the company to found Grell Audio.

He said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">Frances Haugen&#39;s</a> claims don&#39;t make sense and that they paint a &quot;false picture&quot; of the social network. &quot;At the heart of these accusations is this idea that we prioritize profit over safety and well-being. That&#39;s just not true,&quot; he wrote in his post. The Facebook chief cited the Meaningful Social Interactions (MSI) update to News Feed, which was designed to show fewer viral videos and more content from friends and family.&nbsp;</p><p>He said the company went through with the change knowing that it would make people spend less time on the website, because research suggested it was the right thing thing to do for people&#39;s well-being. In Haugen&#39;s testimony, she painted MSI in a less flattering light. She said Zuckerberg chose to apply &quot;metrics defined by Facebook&quot; like MSI &quot;over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation and other inciting content.&quot; The whistleblower said the CEO was presented with solutions to make Facebook &quot;less viral, less twitchy,&quot; but he decided not to use them because they had a negative impact on the MSI metric.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the SEC complaint she filed, Haugen claimed that Facebook allowed &quot;hateful&quot; and &quot;divisive&quot; content, because it is &quot;easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions.&quot; Zuckerberg addressed that in his post, as well, calling it &quot;deeply illogical.&quot; Facebook makes money from ads, he said, and advertisers apparently tell the company that they don&#39;t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Zuckerberg said the research into how Instagram affects young people was mischaracterized. He didn&#39;t explicitly mention it, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> published an article in mid-September about how it knows Instagram is toxic for teen girls based on internal documents detailing Facebook&#39;s own research. The social network eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">published</a> a couple of documents from that research, but Haugen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html">provided</a> Congress with four more. Zuckerberg defended the platform, writing that many teens the company heard from actually &quot;feel that using Instagram helps them when they are struggling with the kinds of hard moments and issues teenagers have always faced.&quot;</p><p>Haugen, who joined Facebook in 2019, worked on democracy and misinformation issues when she was with the company. She brought &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of pages of internal Facebook documents to Whistleblower Aid founder John Tye in addition to filing a whistleblower complaint with the SEC. There were several reports that came out based on those documents, including the existence of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html">VIP program</a> that enabled high-profile users to skirt Facebook&#39;s rules. Haugen also accused Facebook of contributing to election misinformation and the January 6th US Capitol riots.</p><p>As for Zuckerberg, part of his post reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place? If we didn&#39;t care about fighting harmful content, then why would we employ so many more people dedicated to this than any other company in our space — even ones larger than us? If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we&#39;re doing? And if social media were as responsible for polarizing society as some people claim, then why are we seeing polarization increase in the US while it stays flat or declines in many countries with just as heavy use of social media around the world?&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-denies-facebook-profit-over-safety-033717690.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed50340a-0baf-4f7c-a907-b0a4c4ef3cd8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 03:37:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633491486</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T03:38:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/01193280-fbe2-11e9-b3df-18f615b92db2" width="6219" height="4146" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/01193280-fbe2-11e9-b3df-18f615b92db2" width="6219" height="4146" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 25: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks about the new Facebook News feature at the Paley Center For Media on October 25, 2019 in New York City.

Or perhaps you <em>are</em> that streamer? Rode&#39;s boom arm has become a go-to for YouTubers, Twitch channels and podcasters alike. As handy as the PSA1 is, it isn&#39;t so good for lighter cameras and microphones —  at least not without some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM_Cl-hHZtQ">DIY adjustments</a>.</p><p>Enter the PSA1+ ($129). Unveiled today, it&#39;s a revised version of the ubiquitous mic arm that will handle devices as light as 94g / 3.3oz. That might not sound like much, but the original needed a lot more weight to keep its balance, effectively ruling out any microphone or camera under 700g / 24.7 oz. That excludes most webcams, all GoPros (which can now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-8-black-webcam-update-130050315.html">work as webcams</a>) and a bevy of other more affordable mics. Sure, you can tighten the screws or meddle with counterweights, but that isn&#39;t always ideal or guaranteed to work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Functionally, the PSA1+ feels a lot closer to something like <a href="https://www.bluedesigns.com/products/compass/">Blue&#39;s Compass</a> which holds itself in place even without weight thanks to a combination of hand-tightened friction hinges and its internal spring mechanism. Blue&#39;s offering might be better for lighter microphones and cameras but it doesn&#39;t adjust its position as accurately or smoothly as the PSA1 (although its cable management is better).</p><p>The extended device support on the PSA1+ isn&#39;t the only new feature. Rode claims the new arm is completely silent so you won&#39;t suffer errant squeaks or spring noises during your stream or recording. The company also states that part of this is thanks to a revised spring design along with the jazzy new neoprene cover (that kinda makes the PSA1+ look like it&#39;s headed to the gym). The cover makes for a more appealing design over the original&#39;s standard &quot;desk lamp&quot; aesthetic though. That said, there&#39;s some pretty strong branding printed on the side that&#39;ll likely catch your eye during videos. Sadly it doesn&#39;t seem like you can do much about that as the neoprene appears to be physically connected to the cable clips.</p><p>Those clips are a good thing though. As mentioned, cable management, which was functional but not pretty on the PSA1 (essentially it was velcro cable ties) now uses neater, sturdier plastic clasps which should be more reassuring. Now at least either your USB or XLR lead will mostly be out of sight.</p><p>The PSA1+ goes on sale tomorrow for $129.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rodes-psa-1-podcasting-boom-arm-230009046.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aae2d66d-dfd8-4766-9c60-a9f96550e114</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 23:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633429754</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T10:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2424b320-25c6-11ec-9f7d-db3c1e68053e" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2424b320-25c6-11ec-9f7d-db3c1e68053e" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rode]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rode PSA1+ Boom arm.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rode PSA1+ Boom arm]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony is making it harder to buy PS3 and Vita games]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-ps3-vita-store-reversal-psp-174551086.html">keeping the PS3 and Vita stores alive</a>, but that doesn&#39;t mean it will be easy to shop. <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-planning-to-make-ps3-vita-stores-nearly-unusable-1847801952">noticed</a> that Sony is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/important-notice/">shutting down</a> credit card, debit card and PayPal store payments for its older consoles on October 27th.

According to Santosh Janardhan, the company&#39;s vice president of infrastructure, the outage started with what should have been routine maintenance. At some point yesterday, a command was issued that was supposed to assess the availability of the backbone network that connects all of Facebook’s disparate computing facilities. Instead, the order unintentionally took those connections down. Janardhan says a bug in the company’s internal audit system did not properly prevent the command from executing.</p><p>That issue caused a secondary problem that ultimately made yesterday’s outage into the international incident that it became. When Facebook’s DNS servers couldn’t connect to the company’s primary data centers, they stopped advertising the border gateway protocol (BGP) routing information that every device on the internet needs to connect to a server.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The end result was that our DNS servers became unreachable even though they were still operational,” said Janardhan. “This made it impossible for the rest of the internet to find our servers.”</p><p>As we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-messenger-coming-back-online-after-outage-220412330.html">learned partway yesterday</a>, what made an already difficult situation worse was that the outage made it impossible for Facebook engineers to connect to the servers they needed to fix. Moreover, the loss of DNS functionality meant they couldn’t use many of the internal tools they depend on to investigate and resolve networking issues in normal circumstances. That meant the company had to physically send personnel to its data centers, a task that was complicated by the physical safeguards it had in place at those locations.</p><p>“They’re hard to get into, and once you’re inside, the hardware and routers are designed to be difficult to modify even when you have physical access to them,” according to Janardhan. Once it could restore its backbone network, Facebook was cautious not to turn everything back on all at once since the surging power and computing demands may have led to more crashes.</p><p>“Every failure like this is an opportunity to learn and get better, and there’s plenty for us to learn from this one,” said Janardhan.  “After every issue, small and large, we do an extensive review process to understand how we can make our systems more resilient. That process is already underway.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-outage-explainer-193155776.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ffcd19b-c3ab-4d9e-8a2d-0246b051ba72</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 19:31:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633462319</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T19:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/edc78c20-2611-11ec-bde6-5fb47d3ad17d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/edc78c20-2611-11ec-bde6-5fb47d3ad17d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook data center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Russian crew is shooting the first feature film on the ISS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Filming is underway on the first feature-length movie to be shot in space after Russian actor Yulia Sherepild and director Klim Shipenko docked at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iss">International Space Station</a>.

However, where Ubisoft&#39;s Bucharest studio hopes to differentiate the game is with a tweak to the battle royale formula. In <em>Frontline&#39;s</em> signature Expedition mode, you and your team will need to find three pieces of intel scattered across an island map. The twist is that you later need to extract that information by calling in an airlift. Other teams can ambush you during this crucial moment and steal the data you fought so hard to obtain.

The &#39;base&#39; starts at $2,700 with the RTX 3070, 16GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD, while the all-out $3,100 model leaps to the RTX 3080 and 32GB of RAM.</p><p>All the new Windows 11 PCs are <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available to order" href="https://fave.co/3ab9JxT">available to order</a> today.

Facebook is introducing support for co-streaming. The feature allows up to four accounts to stream together concurrently. With today’s rollout, co-streaming is available to all content creators, not just those enrolled in Facebook’s partner program. You can access the functionality search for and tag other creators through the Live Producer left rail, in addition to the Gaming Tab and Stream Dashboard of the edit stream module.</p><p>“With co-streaming, we aim to increase discoverability for creators, encourage collaboration between creators and elevate the overall viewing experience for everyone,” the company said in a blog post. The addition of co-streaming support is a case of Facebook playing catch up. Twitch has offered similar functionality through its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-27-twitch-squad-stream.html">Squad Stream</a> feature since 2019. It’s also worth pointing out the idea itself isn’t new. While it’s no longer around, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-05-onlive-coming-to-browsers-smart-tvs-with-more-viewing-capabilit.html">OnLive</a> introduced a multi-view feature back in 2012.

According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-is-building-smart-fridge-that-monitors-your-buying-patterns-2021-10"><em>Insider</em></a>, the company has been working on a smart fridge that can monitor items and help you order replacements if you&#39;re running low on something.</p><p>The team behind the Amazon Go systems is said to be heading the charge on the project, which has been in the works for at least two years. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">Just Walk Out tech</a> used at Go stores tracks what shoppers put in their carts and automatically charges them when they leave. Members of the Amazon Fresh and Lab126 hardware teams are reportedly involved with the fridge project too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The fridge would monitor the items inside and keep tabs on your purchasing habits, according to the report. If you run low on something you buy frequently, the fridge would notify you and make it easier to order more from Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh, which could give the company&#39;s grocery division a boost. The fridge could offer recipe suggestions too, which may prove useful if you forget about an item that&#39;s about to expire.</p><p>Amazon wouldn&#39;t make the fridges itself, <em>Insider</em>&#39;s sources said. It&#39;s looking to team up with an appliance manufacturer. There&#39;s a possibility that Alexa voice control could be included. That&#39;s said to not be a major concern, but given Amazon&#39;s propensity for stuffing Alexa into nearly every other type of product, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">home robots</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">its own TVs</a>, it wouldn&#39;t be a surprise if the fridge has voice assistant support.</p><p>The company has reportedly spent upwards of $50 million per year on the project so far. Even so, there&#39;s no guarantee that the fridge will come to market as it&#39;s possible Amazon will shelve the plans. If the fridge does come to market, it likely won&#39;t come cheap. An Amazon spokesperson told Engadget the company doesn&#39;t comment “on rumors or speculation.”</p><p>The concept isn&#39;t entirely new. In 2016, Samsung <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-04-samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge.html">revealed a fridge</a> that can help you keep track of what&#39;s inside without having to open the door. You can even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-08-samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-hands-on.html">order groceries</a> using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-samsung-updates-family-hub-smart-fridge-new-ui.html">the built-in touchscreen</a>. Amazon&#39;s fridge would take the idea a little further, though, since it would flag items that you&#39;re about to run out of and help you order more through the company&#39;s own grocery ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-smart-fridge-report-162623916.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">95259e8d-f483-43ec-bbdf-2a3887778d12</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 16:26:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633451332</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T16:28:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f4f0710-25f8-11ec-b9fb-08066930ce5e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f4f0710-25f8-11ec-b9fb-08066930ce5e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/09/01: In this photo illustration, an Amazon logo seen displayed on a smartphone along with a shopping cart.

Facebook can change, but it&#39;s clearly not going to do so on its own.&quot;</p><p>Haugen’s appearance comes days after Facebook sent its head of safety, Antigone Davis, to testify in front of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html"><ins>same committee</ins></a>. She and other executives have repeatedly tried to downplay the company&#39;s research, with Davis saying that the documents &quot;were not bombshell research.&quot; In Tuesday’s hearing, some senators called out Mark Zuckerberg, saying that they should be hearing from him instead. “Rather than taking personal responsibility, showing leadership, Mark Zuckerberg is going sailing,” Blumenthal said, in an apparent reference to a recent Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113955029116581"><ins>post</ins></a> from the CEO.</p><p>Even though he wasn’t in attendance, Zuckerberg’s decisions came up throughout the hearing. Haugen said that several documents she uncovered showed that the Facebook founder “chose metrics defined by Facebook like meaningful social interactions over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation and other inciting content.”</p><p>She said that last April, Zuckerberg was “directly presented with a list of soft interventions” Facebook could take that would make it “less viral, less twitchy” and that he opted not to make the changes because it had a negative impact on the platform’s “meaningful social interactions” metric. She added that even when Facebook does opt to take interventions and slow down its platform, the company’s AI has problems detecting content.</p><p>“When rioting began in the United States in the summer of last year, they turned off downstream MSI [meaningful social interactions] only when they detected content was health content, which is probably COVID, and civic content,” Haugen said. “But Facebook’s own algorithms are bad at finding this content.”</p><p>In a statement following the hearing, Facebook’s Director of Policy Communications, Lena Pietsch, tried to downplay Haugen’s knowledge of the company, writing that she “worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives — and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.”</p><p>“We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about. Despite all this, we agree on one thing: it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It’s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it’s time for Congress to act.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bc4512c-1947-477a-a083-a6e7d53ee43c</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 16:15:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633456549</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T17:55:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/cd47aaf0-fea0-11ea-8add-97a3fe3113dc" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/cd47aaf0-fea0-11ea-8add-97a3fe3113dc" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018.

The Facebook brand is merging its long-form IGTV format with the regular videos from your feed, leaving just one format for all Instagram footage — you won&#39;t have to distinguish between the two. We&#39;ve asked Instagram if this will lead to longer videos playing directly in your feed, but there will always be a Video tab in profiles to explore more content.</p><p>The move might help <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-expands-badges-and-commercials-130020878.html">Instagram-based creators</a>, too. While they&#39;ll still have to produce long-form video to qualify for ads (now called Instagram In-Stream video ads), they should have an easier time reaching viewers who would have glossed over IGTV in the past. Instagram is also merging post and video insights into a single metric.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You may have an easier time polishing that video, too. Instagram is bringing a few common editing features to its videos, including trimming, filters, location tags and people tags. Still images have had filters and tags for a while, of course, but this theoretically puts moving pictures more on par. You may have an easier time finding videos linked to a friend or a memorable concert.</p><p>The merger could boost uptake for Instagram video. IGTV demand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-18-instagram-removes-igtv-button.html">wasn&#39;t what Instagram expected</a>, and this update makes the longer video format more accessible, not to mention less confusing. Creators might be more inclined to share videos on Instagram as a result — and that might help the social media giant better compete <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-three-minute-videos-now-available-182016623.html">against TikTok</a>, YouTube and other video-focused heavyweights.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-merges-igtv-feed-video-160057187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1d2709e3-8257-441d-9f2d-f52cb6909029</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 16:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633449660</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T16:01:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41db8da0-25ec-11ec-bff5-0cb49ecb968c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41db8da0-25ec-11ec-bff5-0cb49ecb968c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram video trimming on iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram video trimming on iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat's newest in-app tool encourages young people to run for office]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap is <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/run-for-office">introducing a new tool</a> to help more young Americans get involved in politics.

The only time we&#39;ve seen the e-reader drop to a lower price was during Prime Day back in June when it was $55.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Bdw5Lf" id="93fbe7903dd6486d88c0191f870e9327" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $60</a><p>We gave this model of the Kindle a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">score of 91</a> when it came out in 2019 — while it doesn&#39;t have as many bells and whistles as the Paperwhite has, it will be exactly what some need in an e-reader. Key upgrades include a higher contrast display and four LED front lights that make it easier to read in dark environments. Amazon also refined the design to be sleeker, although this Kindle is not waterproof like the Paperwhite is.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Kindle excels at being a basic e-reader and it will be an upgrade if you&#39;re used to reading books and articles on your smartphone&#39;s screen. The anti-glare display is much easier on the eyes, the built-in 8GB of storage can thousands of titles and the battery will last weeks on a single charge. The only major downside to the Kindle is one that all other Kindles have, too: you&#39;ll have to deal with Amazon&#39;s lockscreen ads, unless you pay extra to remove them.</p><p>If you are interested in the extras that come with the Paperwhite, Amazon seems to be trying to get rid of the previous version as it anticipates the arrival of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2021 e-reader" href="https://amzn.to/2YlJx16">2021 e-reader</a>, which will ship at the end of this month. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2018 Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/3lbyBMe">2018 Kindle Paperwhite</a> in twilight blue is currently on sale for $75, which is a record low. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">model</a> gives you a higher density display, a waterproof design and Audible support, so you can listen to audiobooks saved on the device when you connect a pair of wireless headphones. Both e-readers are good choices, so it ultimately comes down to which features are necessary to you and how much you&#39;re willing to spend.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3lbyBMe" id="387123e1207740bf85513b9ea086eef0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Paperwhite (2018) at Amazon - $75</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-regular-kindle-is-on-sale-for-60-right-now-135012068.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f783c1a4-96d6-4fa9-87b6-12f8a1dda833</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 13:50:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633441815</ingested><modified>2021-10-05T13:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
