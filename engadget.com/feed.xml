So, an app that lets you play a synthesizer simply by humming a melody was clearly going to grab my attention.</p><p>Dubler first debuted last year as a packaged deal: a custom designed USB microphone and an app that turned your beatboxing, singing or any other audio really into MIDI data. With the launch of <a href="https://vochlea.com/products/dubler2"><ins>Dubler 2</ins></a>, Vochlea is making the special mic optional. The new app allows you to quickly and easily calibrate it to work with any microphone or audio source of your choice. But I want to be frank about something right off the bat: Dubler works best with its own special microphone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5a030940-2000-11ec-9ffc-f6fa10fa4a59" style="height:1126;width:2000;" alt="Microphones" data-uuid="16f78177-c6fa-3158-9f18-d0478aebb6a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>When I tested Dubler using both an SM57 and an SM58 run through a Focusrite 2i4 the results were decidedly mixed. The MIDI data was always a little messier, there was more noticeable latency and the pitch tracking just wasn’t as good. The latency was mostly an issue when using Dubler to trigger drums. With the buffer size in my audio settings at 128 samples it was almost impossible to keep a rhythm as the drum hits came just a little too slow and kept throwing me off.</p><p>If you use the dedicated mic sold by Vochlea, though, the story is a bit different. In fact, Dubler 2 is quite impressive. There is basically no noticeable latency. Pitch tracking is surprisingly accurate. And the resulting MIDI data is reasonably clean… or at least as clean as the source. Which I suppose is one of the first things I should lay out: If you can’t carry a tune, Dubler is only going to be so useful. My vocal skills are borderline nonexistent under the best of circumstances. But the onset of fall allergy season has made things <em>significantly </em>worse. (I would describe my current vocal style as chain-smoking donkey.) Could I get Dubler to spit out something resembling a melody? Sure. But it wasn’t always easy and I had to clean up a lot of MIDI after the fact.</p><p>So, I did what any smart person would do: Enlist the help of their sister who has spent a good chunk of her life singing and training with vocal coaches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c3753510-2000-11ec-b97d-fdcea689eb34" style="height:1344;width:2000;" alt="Dubler 2" data-uuid="10c516aa-dabe-3f3e-a20a-04ec29c09b39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vochlea</div></figure><p>The difference was immediately obvious. Where Dubler often struggled to figure out what was going on with my flat unsteady humming it was generally able to follow my sister’s vocal histrionics without much issue. You can tell Dubler to automatically snap notes to a particular scale which I highly recommend regardless of your skill level. But even in chromatic mode the app was able to pretty accurately identify notes my sister sang and even follow along the vibrato of her voice fairly well.</p><p>To get truly usable results out of Dubler though, you’ll need to learn to use it properly. While it’s fun to belt out a melody or clumsily beatbox your way through a drum part there are a lot of tricks to making the most of the app. For one, you’ll need to tailor your vocal sounds so that the app can recognize them easier. This is especially true of the drum triggers. Simple beatboxing is probably going to trip up the software unless you’re really good. Sounds like “ti” “ts” and “ta” will often get mixed up, so it’s better to use more distinct sounds that you might not reach for if you were actually trying to beatbox, like “ka”. It’s also best if you keep the number of triggers you use to three or four. You can program up to eight, but it’s hard to make varied enough sounds for it to be useful.</p><p>The same is true for melodies too. If you just hum with your lips closed, Dubler will struggle more to tell when you’ve changed notes and you’ll end up with messier data. It’s better to go with percussive sounds like “da” to help separate notes from each other.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d960a080-2000-11ec-afbf-7b4bb02daee6" style="height:1344;width:2000;" alt="Dubler 2" data-uuid="8066bc2e-c70b-38d5-9c9c-ba8a6e56fba1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vochlea</div></figure><p>You can also put Dubler in chord mode which I actually found was a fun and interesting way to come up with new progressions when I was feeling stuck. But perhaps my favorite feature is the ability to turn vowel sounds into MIDI CC information. That means that if you held a note and slowly shifted it from an “ooo” to an “aaa” you could cause the filter to open up. It’s difficult to control these features though, and it was better for creating strange and interesting noises than actual music.</p><p>If you’re vocally inclined then Dubler holds a lot of promise as a musical sketch pad. I sometimes struggle to turn what I hear in my head into melodies on a keyboard or guitar and humming it might be the quickest and easiest way to get an idea out.</p><p>While the ability to use the app with your own mic is appealing, right now the calibration seems like it could use a little work. That being said, my microphones are old and have seen a lot of abuse. And it’s not like the SM57 is known for its perfect vocal fidelity. I’d probably have better luck if I had SM7B fresh out of the box to test with. But I had to make due with what I had. And, what I had, wasn’t as good as Vochlea’s Dubler Studio mic when it came to capturing clean MIDI data. The software is pre-tuned for that mic and there’s fewer variables to contend with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/82735c90-2000-11ec-a7f7-0b9493bc251d" style="height:1126;width:2000;" alt="Dubler Studio mic" data-uuid="55e66fac-5178-3ad5-b7ad-c2250280c9a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Which leads us to our final point: price. Dubler is not cheap. And that’s not surprising. While Vochlea isn’t the first or only company to try turning audio into MIDI, it’s still not a simple task. So you’d have to be pretty committed to the idea of singing to control your synths to drop <a href="https://vochlea.com/products/dubler2"><ins>$329</ins></a> on the Dubler Studio Kit or even the $249 for the app on its own ($78 to upgrade if you own the original Dubler already). For someone like myself, it’s a tough sell. But for a vocalist who wants to start dabbling in the world of music production and synthesizers (even just for idea generation) without having to learn a whole new instrument I can certainly see the appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dubler-2-can-turn-any-microphone-into-a-midi-controller-090002585.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8f537ce-ae87-49f8-abc1-a8c6b1f316c7</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 09:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632795460</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T02:17:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c3753510-2000-11ec-b97d-fdcea689eb34" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d9607640-1ffc-11ec-b2ff-7f18ca371ef5" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vochlea]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dubler 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dubler 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World Japan confirms Donkey Kong expansion for 2024]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210928.html">confirmed</a> that it will expand its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-world-tour-044932014.html">Super Nintendo World</a> theme park at Universal Studios Japan with a new Donkey Kong section.

Logitech might have a more viable alternative for some people, however. It just <a href="https://logi.link/q8uhac">introduced</a> an MX Keys Mini wireless keyboard that shrinks the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-logitech-mx-master-3-mx-keys-hands-on.html">original MX Keys</a> design into a tiny, minimalist footprint.</p><p>The MX Keys Mini doesn&#39;t include a number pad or other perks from a full-size keyboard, but it does preserve the &quot;Perfect Stroke&quot; system that combines non-mechanical switches with dished keys that can improve your typing accuracy. There are even a few new functions you won&#39;t get in the larger keyboard, including a dictation key for Macs and Windows PCs, a microphone mute toggle and an emoji key.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Mini supports Android, ChromeOS, Linux, iOS and iPadOS using either Bluetooth or a USB receiver, with pairing for up to three devices.

That&#39;s not a huge drop from the $130 price of the full MX Keys, but it&#39;s on par with the no-frills Magic Keyboard. It&#39;s arguably a better buy if you prefer the ergonomics of Logitech&#39;s keyboard, don&#39;t like the feel of mechanicals or just want a keyboard you can easily shuffle between platforms.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-keys-mini-keyboard-070128945.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a0958c8-de20-4fad-b9a7-2cb0388dbd10</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:01:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632411704</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T15:41:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce75dad0-1c7e-11ec-bfec-eab60949ca08" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce75dad0-1c7e-11ec-bfec-eab60949ca08" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Logitech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's 2Africa to become the longest subsea cable in the world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2Africa, a subsea cable project funded by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html">Facebook</a> and several telcos, will become the longest subsea cable system ever deployed by the time it&#39;s finished.

While the original 2Africa project was only meant to provide connectivity to 1.2 billion people, the addition of Pearls would allow the cable to serve a total of 3 billion people. He wrote:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The past 18 months have highlighted the importance of connectivity as billions of people around the world rely on the internet to work, attend school, and stay connected to people they care about.

One potential savior was Microsoft, which had negotiated to acquire the app in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-not-buying-tiktok-233257859.html">lost its bid to Oracle</a>. At the <a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021">Code conference</a>, CEO Satya Nadella offered new details on the negotiation, telling journalist Kara Swisher it was &quot;the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever worked on,&quot; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-failed-tiktok-talks-strangest-thing-ive-ever-worked/"><em>Geekwire</em></a> has reported.</p><p>It was a chaotic series of events that started when Trump threatened to force Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US owner, citing privacy and security concerns. Microsoft stepped in as a potential buyer, though the company in the end struck a deal with Oracle and Walmart that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-oracle-walmart-sale-shelved-142133736.html">scrapped</a> by President Joe Biden&#39;s administration in February 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok originally came to Microsoft, Nadella emphasized, seeking a cloud and security partner to help it pilot the delicate political landscape between China and the US. &quot;That&#39;s kind of how it started,&quot; he said. &quot;But I was pretty intrigued. I must say, it&#39;s a great property. Obviously, everyone has seen that growth and what have you, and I guess the rest is history.&quot;</p><p>In fact, just yesterday, TikTok reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html">a billion users</a> and did so in less than four years. For perspective, it took Instagram almost eight years after its initial release and nearly six years after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-20-instagram-1-billion-users.html">pass the 1 billion user threshold</a>.</p><blockquote><p>President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.</p></blockquote><p>Swisher persisted with the subject, asking Nadella about Microsoft&#39;s negotiations with Trump. “President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.”</p><p>In fact, Microsoft was in the middle of negotiations with ByteDance when Trump dropped a bomb, telling reporters that he&#39;d rather ban the app than allow it to be sold to a US company, according to a book by Microsoft President Brad Smith.

Conducting a teardown of the device, iFixit <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928#?vgo_ee=xKmL%2BGmGXT5ug3Fpl2XHLRCU%2BQ9q5um3eYXtRi1pJDQ%3D">found</a> it couldn’t get the iPhone 13’s Face ID feature to work if replaced the phone’s display. No matter what workaround it tried, iFixit could not get Face ID to work again.

His comments come more than 10 days after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">published</a> an investigation into how Instagram affects the teens who use it. Citing internal research conducted by Facebook, <em>The Journal</em> wrote that “Instagram is harmful for a sizable percentage” of teens, particularly teenage girls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The investigation prompted immediate pushback from lawmakers, many of whom were already wary of Facebook’s handling of child safety, and its plans to build a version of its service for children under 13. On Monday, Instagram said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html">“pause”</a> that work in order to create more “parental supervision tools.” Members of Congress responded saying they want the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democratic-lawmakers-cancel-instagram-kids-184621575.html">to end</a> the project entirely. Facebook’s head of safety is scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms">hearing</a> on the subject Thursday.</p><p>Now, Facebook seems to be hoping that releasing more of its underlying research could help address concerns from lawmakers and others. In a separate statement <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">published</a> Sunday, the company’s top researcher suggested that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> had mischaracterized its research. Clegg went a step further Monday, saying that the reporting based on documents “leaked by someone who clearly feels they have some points to make.”</p><p>“If you read the decks, and then compare it with some of the assertions that, you know, Instagram is toxic for all teens and so on, I don&#39;t think any reasonable person … would say that the research sustains that claim,” Clegg said. “When the dust settles people will see that we&#39;re just sincerely trying to kind of — like external researchers — are trying to work out what the complex relationship is between individuals, given their own individual circumstances, and their lives and their use of social media.”</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company would release “two decks” that were central to <em>The Journal</em> report, but didn’t elaborate on the timing of the release.</p><p>But the decks alone are unlikely to quiet Facebook’s critics. For one, Facebook’s own rebuttal of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reporting appears <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">to undermine</a> the significance of its own research. “This research, some of which relied on input from only 40 teens, was designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram,” Facebook VP Pratiti Raychoudhury wrote. “It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues.”</p><p>It also raises questions about how Facebook will present the data it does make public. Last month, the company released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">a report</a> on “widely viewed content” on its platform. The report was meant to rebuff criticism that News Feed favors polarizing content. But researchers outside the company quickly poked holes in the report, and said it was emblematic of Facebook’s larger transparency issues, particularly when it comes to working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">outside researchers</a>.</p><p>Which is why it’s notable that Clegg would invoke “external researchers” in his defense of the company. If Instagram isn’t actually harmful to most teens, as the company is claiming, then researchers not on Facebook’s payroll may be positioned to credibly make that point. Yet researchers say the company has made data increasingly difficult to access. And in some cases, the company has actively blocked outsiders from studying its platform, like when it recently disabled the personal Facebook accounts of researchers at New York University and then provided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-letter-facebook-nyu-ad-observatory-014113346.html">“misleading”</a> explanations about its reasons for doing so, according to the FTC. (Incidentally, the researcher at the center of that controversy is testifying in a separate Congressional<a href="https://republicans-science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/investigations-oversight-subcommittee-hearing-disinformation-black-box"> hearing</a> this week.)</p><p>They may seem like unrelated issues. But if Facebook had better relationships with researchers outside the company, and made more of its own findings public it might be better able to head off internal critics who “have some points to make.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7fac7da-2314-48c0-a67a-2db264a54e1c</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 21:25:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632784654</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T23:17:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A visitor takes a picture of the Instagram application logo at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018.

According to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/babylon-5-reboot-the-cw-j-michael-straczynski-1235075236/"><em>Variety</em></a>, The CW has ordered a reboot of the seminal sci-fi series. What’s more, original creator J. Michael Straczynski is attached to the project.</p><p>That’s good news because Straczynski penned 92 of the 110 episodes that make up <em>Babylon 5</em>. At the moment, there are relatively few details on the production, but what we do know is that it’s being billed as a “from-the-ground-up reboot.” None of the original actors from the series, including Bruce Boxleitner, are currently attached to the project, but that may change. With its sometimes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-original-4-3-ratio-video-150022687.html">dated visuals</a>, it can be hard to see what makes <em>Babylon 5 </em>so special.

It <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/blogs/2021-08-announcement-modern-skype/"><ins>offered a peek</ins></a> at what&#39;s coming later this year, with a focus on speed, reliability and design, as well as other improvements. For one thing, video calls (on what Skype calls the &quot;call stage&quot;) are getting a visual overhaul. New layouts and themes are on the way. You&#39;ll be able to see yourself on the main view while you&#39;re on a call, though you can hide your feed if you&#39;d rather not look at your own face.</p><p>Video feeds are being rearranged into a grid to avoid relegating folks to a minimized view. Instead everyone on the call, including those who aren&#39;t sharing video, will be visible. You&#39;ll see larger video feeds in the top bar too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/76204480-1fc4-11ec-876f-7fe626faed85" style="height:1215;width:2160;" alt="Skype video call redesign" data-uuid="f3132c3f-f09d-3c52-b3ba-b9ea86fb1a0f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p>There are several viewing options for the call stage, including speaker view, grid view, a large gallery and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-together-mode-skype-192645916.html"><ins>Together Mode</ins></a> (which makes seem like everyone&#39;s in the same space). You can also opt only to include people who are sharing video in the grid or switch the video stream off completely. Audio-only participants can use one of the app&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skype-custom-background-images-193644673.html"><ins>background replacement images</ins></a> while on a call, rather than grey nothingness.</p><p>More colorful themes are in the pipeline, with features including gradients for buttons and for users without avatars. Meanwhile, &quot;the beauty of the left side panel screams art, balance and lightness,&quot; says Skype, giving perhaps its best Apple impression.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1e5a8570-1fc5-11ec-beff-297b5e4c87b1" style="height:3087;width:3550;" alt="Redesigned Skype Meet Now invite, with a name and avatar for the call" data-uuid="96cbe954-01b8-332d-a6ac-911f3e15a217"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p>Skype is also redesigning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-skype-meet-now-zoom.html"><ins>Meet Now</ins></a>, which allows people to join calls without signing up or installing the app. Invitation links are getting a new look, as invitees will see the name and avatar of your call. The service says it will soon support all browsers as well.</p><p>In addition, Skype is working on performance. It claims it has boosted performance &quot;in key scenarios&quot; by almost a third on the desktop app and by over 2,000 percent on Android. Also new or on the way are custom notification sounds, and an updated reactions window that lets you respond more quickly by searching or using pinned reactions.</p><p>Elsewhere, you can use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-16-office-lens-on-windows-10-support-office365.html">Office Lens</a> on the Skype mobile app to share scanned documents, photos and videos. A new feature called TwinCam will let you add a video feed from a second device to your call. That could be handy if you want to show off your pet, or let students see your textbook and your face at the same time. Just scan a QR code with your iOS or Android device to get started.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8aecab60-1fc4-11ec-a4fd-06187d52d3e8" style="height:700;width:1453;" alt="Skype TwinCam feature" data-uuid="4f701542-20af-3a43-97e5-517269214cb7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skype-colorful-redesign-features-twincam-191644761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4423367b-d07c-4126-b4bb-d1959829c5f8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:16:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632770207</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T19:16:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skype]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democratic lawmakers say Facebook 'must completely abandon' Instagram Kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mere hours after Facebook said it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html"><ins>pausing work on Instagram Kids</ins></a>, a group of Democratic lawmakers has called on the company to instead completely abandon the project.

Google is rolling out a feature that lets TV-bound Stadia players use their Android phone or iPhone as a virtual gamepad.

In most cases, you&#39;ll need to either add a controller or enable the touch gamepad through the Stadia mobile app, and promptly choose &quot;play on TV.&quot; Android TV and Google TV owners will also need to enable a controller through the avatar section on the big-screen Stadia app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This might help boost Stadia&#39;s adoption. While it has long given you the flexibility of where you can play, you haven&#39;t had many choices for that setup. It&#39;s now relatively easy to use a favorite gamepad with your TV or, if you prefer, save a little money and use no gamepad at all. It won&#39;t be perfect, however. A phone&#39;s touchscreen can only do so much, and using your phone as a go-between is bound to add a little latency.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/stadia-tv-phone-gamepad-support-160049482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6546a82c-acdc-4cc5-b197-6488bef9030f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632425046</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:24:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17d31c70-1c9c-11ec-b7ef-48061bbd95a0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17d31c70-1c9c-11ec-b7ef-48061bbd95a0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on TV using phone as gamepad]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on TV using phone as gamepad]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Life is Strange: Remastered Collection' will arrive on February 1st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Square Enix has put <em>Life is Strange: Remastered Collection</em> back on the release calendar.

The company announced the milestone in a <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok">blog post</a> on Monday. Attracting 1 billion users to any platform is a significant feat. However, TikTok’s rise in popularity is especially impressive when you consider almost exactly a year ago the Trump Administration was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-ban-trump-023941270.html">threatening to ban</a> the app if ByteDance, TikTok’s Bejing-based parent company, didn’t sell it to an American buyer.</p><p>Then you have the speed at which TikTok achieved the feat. The app has only been widely available since 2018 — though you could download it in select markets as early as 2017. It took Instagram nearly eight years after its initial release and almost six years after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-20-instagram-1-billion-users.html">passed the 1 billion user threshold</a>. Granted, the internet was a smaller place then with fewer people connected to it through their phones, but none of that takes away from TikTok’s ascent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f95c020-9a99-4d43-9043-e58d8798c327</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:40:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632757238</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T15:40:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - January 21, 2020: TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will open up the Oculus Go to tinkerers with an unlocked OS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/facebook"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> will soon let folks who still have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oculus%20go"><ins>Oculus Go</ins></a> do so much more with the virtual reality headset.
