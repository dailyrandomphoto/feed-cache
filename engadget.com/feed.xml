The company plans to introduce its first concept EV by 2022, followed by a plug-in hybrid and a third type of unknown vehicle. That follows Dodge&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dodge-muscle-car-ev-161146368.html">announcement in July</a> that it would introduce its first &quot;eMuscle&quot; car by 2024, promising it will &quot;tear up the streets, not the planet.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, the company and its parent Stellantis didn&#39;t say what would happen to its internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, but it has now clarified that. &quot;These cars that you know today will go out of production by the time we get to 2024,&quot; Dodge Brand CEO Tim Kuniskis told <em>Motor Trend</em> in an interview.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>I&#39;m juggling knives because I&#39;ve gotta keep two different huge factions happy because at some point those two factions will converge.</p></blockquote><p>The new electric vehicles may use the &#39;60s triangular <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/07/08/dodge-electric-muscle-car-2024/">Fratzog name and logo</a> to differentiate them. The first concept arriving in 2022 will be an electric muscle car, revealed in the next four or five months as a high-performance, drivable vehicle. The next model, a plug-in hybrid, will be a new car but not a Durango as some expected, according to Kuniskis. The third vehicle is unknown, but will be a &quot;very, very, very, significant car at the end of the year,&quot; he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Diehard muscle car fans might not take the news well, though they can&#39;t deny the superior performance of EVs. Dodge <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/22/the-muscle-car-goes-electric-dodge-sets-2024-end-date-for-gas-chargers-challengers/">previously advertised</a> the Challenger in &quot;Demon&quot; trim as the quickest 0-100MPH production car in the world, with the rather large caveat that it &quot;excludes non-mass production vehicles [supercars] and hybrids/electric.&quot;</p><p>Kuniskis acknowledged that the announcement could create friction. &quot;I&#39;m juggling knives because I&#39;ve gotta keep two different huge factions happy because at some point those two factions will converge,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is no one knows when they will converge. My job is to provide confidence, over the next 24 months, that we&#39;re gonna do this.&quot;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dodge-is-killing-its-challenger-and-charger-muscle-cars-in-favor-of-e-vs-085839976.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d6942e8-0c34-4bf4-a0d2-2d8948dfc2c8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:58:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637657921</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T08:58:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raymond Boyd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO - FEBRUARY 06:  2020 Dodge Charger SXT is on display at the 112th Annual Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois on February 6, 2020.

For better or worse, no other creator in the gaming industry has pushed the medium closer to film than Kojima. And after hinting his studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-kojima-may-venture-filmmaking.html"><ins>could venture into filmmaking</ins></a>, it&#39;s doing precisely that.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-22-kojima-productions-launches-new-film-tv-and-music-division"><em><ins>GamesIndustry.Biz</ins></em></a>, Kojima Productions has established a division dedicated to music, TV and film that will operate out of Los Angeles. Riley Russell, a former Sony Interactive executive, will lead the unit as it attempts to expand the cultural footprint of Kojima Productions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="532628924b594aa2b4fd4f66c4f1e6e5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3nzuv87ik4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music and film, as well as the more familiar games industry,&quot; Russell told the outlet. &quot;The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not surprising to see Kojima Productions expand beyond games. Kojima is known for his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">film-like approach</a> to making games, and if you <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1462586580023922689?s=20">follow him on Twitter</a>, you&#39;ll know he frequently tweets about his favorite albums and movies. The question now becomes how the studio plans to handle the expansion. Since reforming in 2015, Kojima Productions has released one game. You can push that number to two if you count the recent Director&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-trailer-release-date-220511148.html"> Cut</a> release of <em>Death Stranding</em> as a separate title. What would a film adaptation of <em>Death Stranding</em> look like? For that matter, what would an adaptation of any Kojima game look like? We may just find out soon enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kojima-productions-film-music-tv-division-183631759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f9ce52fb-4426-4f75-b515-745f62affc54</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 18:36:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637605794</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T18:29:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/772b6760-4bc0-11ec-9fb7-b1eceb6cc104" width="4450" height="3091" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/772b6760-4bc0-11ec-9fb7-b1eceb6cc104" width="4450" height="3091" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Japanese video game designer, Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions Co., Ltd. is introduced by the Sony Corporation during their PlayStation 4 E3 2016 event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2016.

(If you don’t know, Game &amp; Watch were a line of handheld LCD devices from the ‘80s that could each play one very simple game.) Rather than featuring a single title, the Super Mario anniversary device had a full version of the original adventure as well as its Japan-only sequel, known in the West as <em>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</em>.</p><p>Nintendo’s pulling the same trick this year with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">35th-anniversary Legend of Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch </a>that just went on sale. And like last year’s model, it includes a color screen and full games, but the selection is more generous. It includes the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em>, both originally released on the NES. It also includes <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, which came out on the Game Boy in 1993, making this essentially a collection of Zelda’s early 8-bit adventures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9e195ca3-908a-4f1b-a864-e55c15b91250"/><p>I actually have never really played the first two Zelda games, though I do love <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review.html">played the Switch remaster</a> a few years ago, but I haven’t touched the original game since my childhood — so when we got a chance to check this tiny device out, I was pretty thrilled to give that game a go.</p><p>The Game &amp; Watch itself is elegantly designed, but also feels rather cheap. It’s a tiny, palm-sized device with an eye-catching gold front, while the rest of the device is clad in green plastic. The front has a 2.36-inch color LCD screen that is very small but also looks great — and when playing <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, the upgrade from the Game Boy’s screen, which had no backlight, is dramatic. The D-Pad and buttons are nothing to write home about, but they’re good enough.</p><p>On the right side of the device is an exceedingly modern USB-C port for charging its battery (which is pretty meager, so you’re going to need to do that a lot) and a power button; the speaker is on the left side. Finally, there’s a great Easter egg on the back: When the screen is on, the Triforce glows subtly through the green plastic. It’s a great little detail.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd402-4bad-11ec-b8be-2eb0c10a1f07" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="44813193-260a-3805-9dfe-42549c2b8267"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Game &amp; Watch has a few different modes: clock, timer and game. Pressing the “game” button lets you switch between the three Zelda titles, a Link-themed version of <em>Vermin</em> (from a 1980 Game &amp; Watch), and the timer. The clock and timer are fairly self-explanatory, but their use of Zelda action as backgrounds is expertly done.</p><p>On the clock, you’ll see the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, and the CPU-controlled Link essentially battles his way through the game over the course of the next 12 hours, defeating Ganon and rescuing Zelda at 11:59. If you’re so inclined, you can pick up the console and control the action from the clock screen at any time. Likewise, the timer features a handful of different scenes from <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em> that you can either watch or play yourself. The device’s packaging even converts into a little stand so you can use the Game &amp; Watch as a desk clock.</p><p>If you’re interested in this Game &amp; Watch, though, you’re not in it for playing the clock: you want to relive Link’s earliest adventures on the smallest portable device you can find. Sure, you can play the NES Zelda collection on the Switch (or many other old Nintendo devices), but the Game &amp; Watch’s miniature screen and old-school controls feel just right for these adventures. That’s doubly true with <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, since it was originally designed for portable systems.</p><p>The games themselves are exactly as you remember them, with no quality of life enhancements or graphics updates; <em>Link’s Awakening</em> is in black and white, rather than the later “DX” version released for the Game Boy color. I’m not complaining, though, as these original versions seem right for the Game &amp; Watch as a celebration of the series’ 8-bit origins.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd400-4bad-11ec-9e7f-06f68fb39497" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="96806375-923f-3239-8e5a-3913e18737fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>How you feel about these games will depend on your history with the series. Like I said, I’ve never played the original NES Zelda adventures; I got on board with <em>A Link to the Past</em> in 1992. As such, I don’t have a lot of nostalgic love for the original pair, and playing the first game was an exercise in frustration. There’s barely a map, Link is slow while enemies are fast, and aiming is imprecise at best. I definitely died more than my fair share of times, which was rather humbling for this self-described Zelda expert. But hey, I shouldn’t have expected anything different from a 1986 game, and I started to get the hang of it soon enough.</p><p><em>Link’s Awakening</em>, on the other hand, was like visiting an old friend. Muscle and brain memory combined to have me slashing my way through it in no time at all, and it controlled just like I remembered. The A and B buttons may have felt rather squishy, but the D-pad was close enough to the one on my old Game Boy that I felt right at home. I don’t know if I’ll finish the NES Zelda games, but I’ll definitely play through <em>Link’s Awakening</em>.</p><p>So who exactly is this $50 device for? The <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Game &amp; Watch was really only meant for people who loved that first Mario game, not necessarily people who love the Mario franchise in general. Likewise, The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch is best for someone who loved these original games growing up. It doesn’t even have to be all three, though — if one of them was a formative gaming experience, you’ll delight in getting a chance to play it on a cute little handheld. But someone raised on <em>Twilight Princess</em> or <em>Breath of the Wild</em> probably will find these a lot less essential.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-game-and-watch-review-173041656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4555aee0-ce9e-408a-b6a0-25d56a1ff37d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637607992</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T19:06:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The rectangular Zelda Game & Watch sitting on an old wooden desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zelda Game & Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analogue's Pocket handheld starts shipping on December 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html"><ins>multiple delays</ins></a>, the Analogue Pocket finally has an exact release date.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 695" href="https://amzn.to/3FIZjnb">Roomba 694</a>, which came out earlier this year as a replacement for the Roomba 675, has dropped back down to an all-time low of $179. Normally $275, this model was already fairly inexpensive — especially for an iRobot device — but this Black Friday sale puts it in line with budget models from the likes of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker" href="https://amzn.to/3cAbhCS">Anker</a> and others.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FIZjnb" id="d0284edbad674d03a7e5d171d7afa32c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179</a><p>iRobot carried over most of the features from the Roomba 675 to the new 694, but the latest robo-vac has a sleeker design that features three physical buttons on its top. You can manually control the device using those buttons, or you can turn to the mobile app for that. When we tested the Roomba 694 for our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>, we found it to be good at cleaning both hard and carpeted floors, thanks in part to iRobot&#39;s three-stage cleaning system, and we liked its ability to focus on particularly dirty spots until they were completely clean. One of the on-device buttons even lets you activate a spot-cleaning mode if and when you want the device to clean only a targeted spot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companion app is one of the Roomba 694&#39;s selling points. It&#39;s pretty easy to navigate, even for those who have never used a robot vacuum before. With the iRobot app and the device connected to WiFi, you can set cleaning schedule and remotely turn the device on and off. You can even use Alexa or Google Assistant commands to tell the robo-vac to start a cleaning job — and when it&#39;s finished, it&#39;ll automatically return to its base for a recharge. It should last roughly 90 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough time for it to clean one floor of your home (depending on how big it is) or the entirety of a small apartment.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

But Sundance isn&#39;t giving up on the digital platforms it used to stream films and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sundance-film-festival-ar-vr-new-frontier-200029918.html">bring cinephiles into a VR social hub</a> last January. As part of its New Frontier exhibition, Sundance plans to expand The Spaceship, its virtual venue where attendees can chat together and explore VR and mixed reality art installations.</p><p>In an effort to connect Sundance&#39;s in-person attendees with its global online audience, the Festival will also launch a &quot;Biodigital Bridge&quot; in Park City.

Developed together with the <a href="https://activetheory.net/home">immersive studio Active Theory</a>, the bridge will offer basic chat support, but it&#39;s mostly a way for Sundance-goers to see how other attendees enjoy the event.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abd510-4ba6-11ec-bda7-e2fce30f42be" alt="Sundance New Frontier curator Shari Frilot." data-uuid="4108bde2-89a1-385e-8044-286729043f77"><figcaption>Sundance New Frontier curator Shari Frilot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sundance Film Festival</div></figure><p>Frilot says New Frontier has been pushing the concept of biodigital experiences for <a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/welcome-to-biodigital-theatre">several years now</a>, mostly through an exploration of how technology can intersect with our lives. Think of the way that an app like Uber, or even Google Maps, has reshaped the way we navigate physical spaces. But now that the pandemic has forced us to rely on our tech more than ever — Sundance wouldn&#39;t have been possible without it last year, after all — the term seems practically prescient. It&#39;s more than just a buzzword: Frilot says she&#39;s interested in exploring the technology that best serves humanity, or Team Human, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-douglas-rushkoff-sxsw-team-human.html">media theorist Douglas Rushkoff put it</a>.</p><p>Last year, I found <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sundance-film-festival-ar-vr-new-frontier-200029918.html">Sundance&#39;s online platform last year</a> to be a fascinating way to explore the festival and interact with fans. The core of the experience is the aforementioned Spaceship, which allows attendees on computers and VR headsets to mull about together. On a laptop or desktop, it resembles a stripped down version of Second Life. You walk around as simplistic avatars, and if you choose, you can also flip on your webcam, which fills your avatar&#39;s head with a live video feed. Since Sundance&#39;s platform is built on WebXR, a way to deliver virtual reality over the web, you can enter that same space in VR by slipping on any headset and visiting Sundance&#39;s website.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc20-4ba6-11ec-beef-5a7a3ecb7158" alt="Sundance Film Festival 2022 New Frontier" data-uuid="e4873a52-a56b-3961-98a5-79ec69abbcfd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sundance Film Festival</div></figure><p>Compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sxsw-2021-vr-finding-pandora-x-193201426.html">SXSW&#39;s VR platform</a>, which looked beautiful but mostly felt like a virtual wasteland, it was clear that Sundance got something right last year. After isolating for most of 2020, being able to see many of my cinephile friends in VR made last year&#39;s Sundance feel special. So for next year, Frilot says, the festival is going even further. The Spaceship will be upgraded with a new Cinema House, where attendees on computers and VR headsets can view events livestreamed from Park City, as well as room-scale discussions.</p><p>On the ground, Sundance will also have a new space called The Craft, which will let in-person attendees visit New Frontier exhibits, artist discussions and panels. There will also be VR headsets to use, though the festival is also encouraging people to bring their own gear if they&#39;ve got it. Sundance hasn&#39;t finalized its list of New Frontier exhibits yet, but Frilot tells me many artists are optimizing for the Oculus Quest 2, so fest-goers can experience their work without being connected to a PC. But there will likely still be pieces that demand a serious VR rig. Sundance&#39;s famed Egyptian theater will also host some New Frontier performances, which will occur both on the ground and virtually on the Spaceship.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5976386d16744076aba6a3b7014aaae9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52ac4a40-4ba6-11ec-bc5f-54b08eeb1e88" alt="Sundance&#39;s new virtual Cinema House."></section><p>You&#39;ll need a <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/tickets/">$50 Sundance Explorer Pass</a> to access all of these virtual goodies, which is double what it cost last year.

Notably, the Explorer Pass is also open to people around the world, whereas Sundance&#39;s virtual screenings are limited to U.S. attendees.</p><p>&quot;[The virtual platform] is not just this thing that we&#39;re trying, we&#39;re actually doubling down on this,&quot; Frilot says. &quot;This points to the vital landscape of how cinema and storytelling is going to manifest [going forward]. We&#39;re here to not only contribute to it, but to meet it and support it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sundance-vr-2022-film-festival-154350393.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d196ae8-268f-418c-a5bc-ffce0c0e949a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:43:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637595835</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T15:44:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Festivals, Concerts & Shows]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc21-4ba6-11ec-bfd5-74c0d25e58b3" width="1409" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc21-4ba6-11ec-bfd5-74c0d25e58b3" width="1409" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundance Film Festival]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Film Party hub on Sundance's virtual Spaceship.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sundance Film Festival 2022 New Frontier]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Instant Pot Duo Plus is already half off for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven&#39;t jumped on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pot bandwagon</a> yet, the holiday shopping season is a great time to buy one because you&#39;ll find most models on sale.

It combines nine cooking methods in one device: pressure cooking, slow cooking, sautéing, rice cooking, yogurt making, steaming, warming, sous vide cooking and sterilizing. It also has a number of quick-cooking modes, including slow cook, soup, eggs and rice, that can be activated with just one button press. All that is to say that this one device can prepare a bunch of different foods in various ways, without much hassle on the part of the home cook. The inner pot is made of food-grade stainless steel and is dishwasher safe, too, so cleanup is a breeze as well. And with this model&#39;s six-quart capacity, you&#39;ll be able to make a full meal for a mid-sized family or a group of visiting friends easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Air frying is a big trend right now and thankfully you don&#39;t have to buy a dedicated air fryer to get those results. A few Instant Pot models have an air fry mode, but they require a special lid. The Instant Pot Pro Crisp is one such model that comes with the necessary lid (along with the standard multi-cooker lid) and it&#39;s $80 off right now, bringing it down to $170. This model has 11 cooking modes, the two included lids plus additional accessories like an air fryer basket and a dehydrating/broiling tray. It&#39;s also an eight-quart machine, making it even better than the discounted Duo Plus for large families and gatherings.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

As reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/19/google-messages-imessage-reaction-emoji/"><em><ins>9to5 Google</ins></em></a>, the app now turns Tapbacks into emoji.</p><p>Until now, Messages has converted Tapbacks into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-06-google-messages-rcs-reaction-texts.html"><ins>&quot;fallback&quot; text</ins></a>. So, if an Android user sent a message to an iPhone owner reading &quot;see you in ten?&quot; and their iOS buddy used the thumbs up reaction, Messages displayed that response as its own line of text (i.e. &quot;liked &#39;see you in ten?&#39;&quot;). That often made conversations far messier than they needed to be, especially in group chats.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-reactions-211218244.html"><ins>brought emoji reactions to Messages</ins></a> on RCS-compatible Android devices last year, but there are some differences from iOS Tapbacks. While Apple uses a heart icon, a &quot;ha ha&quot; label and other punctuation, Google uses emoji. So, the Android app appears to convert the heart into a face with heart eyes, &quot;ha ha&quot; into a laughing face and so on. Some nuance might get lost in translation, but it&#39;s still far cleaner than Google&#39;s previous method of displaying Tapbacks.</p><p>Word of the change first emerged via <em>9to5 Google</em>&#39;s deep dive into the latest Messages beta. Google is now rolling out the update. We&#39;re not quite at the stage where iMessage is on Android, but at least Google is playing a little nicer with iOS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-android-imessage-reactions-emoji-150947375.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b84676b4-6417-420d-867a-ee03664cae1e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:09:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637593790</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T15:09:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f2ddca0-4ba5-11ec-af7b-ea5b1e5ba87c" width="752" height="447" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f2ddca0-4ba5-11ec-af7b-ea5b1e5ba87c" width="752" height="447" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tapback reactions on Apple's Messages app, with the heart option highlighted.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tapback reactions on Apple's Messages app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GoDaddy discloses recent security breach that exposed 1.2 million accounts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm">disclosures</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission, web registrar and hosting company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/godaddy-sent-fake-phising-email-promising-holiday-bonus-220756457.html">GoDaddy</a> has revealed that it discovered it had been hacked.

Innovators like Hexoskin and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-26-omsignal-smart-shirt.html">Omsignal</a>, not to mention huge companies like Adidas and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-18-ralph-lauren-polotech-review.html">Ralph Lauren</a>, have struggled to make an impact, demanding a lot of money for dedicated shirts and sensors, while contending with mediocre accuracy, polarizing style choices and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-10-the-future-of-wearables.html">not many compelling reasons to exist</a>. As Adam Crofts, founder of the startup <a href="https://www.prevayl.com/">Prevayl</a>, puts it, there have been a lot of lessons to learn from other companies’ mistakes. He’s hoping to get it right.</p><p>Prevayl, whose first products launch in the UK later this month, combines a small tracking sensor with a line of fitness “smart” shirts, from crop tops through to vests and compression shirts, in addition to a companion app (of course) and an online community. Usually, that means something approximating a forum, but according to the company’s website, it’s created “a members-only private community designed for amateur athletes and the sporting elite.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s limited its first wave of users to 700 people. The audience seems to be, well, the fittest friends and acquaintances you know. The ones that know what they can benchpress, their fastest 5K time, or their VO2 Max. The latter is not a haircare product.</p><p>Prevayl’s sweet spot is this area between amateur athlete and biometric obsessive, and it’s approaching the fitness tech fight with style. It has a slick promotional video featuring pro athletes, a moody black logo and a surprisingly slick, well designed app. (Seriously, it amazes me how poor most entry-level fitness apps can still look.) And the shirt? Well, it looks good on the athletes.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cc9a4f938a3c466b99af230cbbc163b6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bfe7-63c0c79b9f14" alt="Prevayl smart shirt"></section><p>At a preview event in London, the team set me up in one of their first shirts, ahead of a planned launch early next year. It feels like a premium, luxury sports tee. It’s breathable, soft to the touch and <em>tight</em>. An elasticated band across the chest on all of the garments houses the conductive sensors, connected with graphene-augmented knitted electrodes. The fibers connecting these sensors look like metallic shoelaces and are machine washable. The shirt can go straight into a warm laundry wash; you just need to ensure you’ve taken the sensor out from the tiny pocket on the front of the clothing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bbed-2e49a491e595" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="8af94e6e-a70c-362a-93ca-cd30ff20ff81"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no need to fasten the sensor in place, as it comes in contact with the conductive fabric as soon as it’s in the front of the shirt. The sensor itself is an evolution from the chunky haphazard sensor unit design of smartwear’s past. The sensor has a plastic stopper that protects the USB-C charging port, while the charging cable is a small, machined aluminum clasp that magnetically folds in on itself.</p><p>The company makes everything here in-house, and Crofts believes this is why Prevayl can do things differently. “Usually, it’s been tech [companies] trying to make clothing or visa versa.” The company’s approach to the clothing itself was “style led” design. Prevayl’s head office has entire machines and technicians dedicated to knitting the clothing part of the equation.</p><p>Despite the sensor itself being so small, it’s packed with tech. There’s a “clinical-grade” ECG, that tracks your workout with four times the frequency of Polar heart rate monitors. It also monitors breathing frequency, motion and even body temperature. There’s even a bioimpedance sensor, which can be used for body composition scans, but there didn’t seem to be any feature that takes advantage of that yet. Prevayl is trying to do it all.</p><p>The company puts all this biometric data to use through many of the features and guidance you’ve seen on other fitness devices and services. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pga-tour-whoop-wearable-player-biometrics-100048054.html">Whoop</a>, the system can be used to gauge whether your body has <a href="https://www.whoop.com/experience/">fully recovered</a> from a workout; like MyZone’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/myzone-mz-switch-heart-rate-monitor-130550081.html">traffic light system</a>, it color-codes your workout effort into five categories, measuring both how hard you’re working out and when your heart rate has recovered. This is all in addition to tracking your heart-rate, caloric burn and more. Within the app, you can even see an accurate cardiogram of your heart as it beats away.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-be97-e63e3dbfd165" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="d641e81e-33d2-3f93-bf79-37a930e340e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the bigger challenges, which many fitness trackers and wearables struggle with, is ensuring a decent level of accuracy. Crofts mentioned multiple times during our interview that the company has been obsessed with gathering data.</p><p>The company worked with the UK’s University of Salford to validate the accuracy of its ECG unit. The team also recruited professional athletes, including British Olympic and Paralympic athletes and professional sportspeople, to test its prototypes and offer up crucial data for the team to chew over. The next stage is testing with more typical gym-goers, weekend warriors and the marginal gain-chaser, kicking off this month.</p><p>Even sized at a large, my tee felt a little too snug. I know many of us aren’t fans of the compression fit, but this, a tank top and crop top are the only options for now. Fortunately, Prevayl is working on loose fit and long-sleeved options, which I’d find more appealing. More colors, beyond Personal Trainer Black (my name, not theirs), are also incoming. The issue remains, though: If you wanted to use this system frequently, you will need more than one top. Or to do a daily laundry run.</p><p>As the sensor is removable, this should strip away some (most?) of the cost of additional shirts. But Prevayl wants to invade the luxury sportswear segment and that means prices to reflect that ambition. To begin with, it will cost you at least £120, which is roughly equivalent to $160. <a href="https://shop.prevayl.com/product">This starter kit </a>includes a sensor priced at £60, and a tank top. Not including the sensor, the Smart Tank will cost £60, while the Smarts Sports Bra will be £65. The Smart T-Shirt, which I tested, will cost £70. The impressive specs and tight app integration will go up against the expensive cost of entry.</p><p>Judging from my demo with Prevayl’s team (and my own early testing), the product is already looking polished. I spoke with a fitness professional at my local gym who, conveniently, had also tested out Prevayl. She noted that any new smartwear product would have to fight against incumbent chest straps and fitness trackers. Unlike a smartwatch, it’s nearly impossible to wear this top in tandem with a chest strap from another manufacturer. People are creators of habit — especially when it comes to exercise. People swear by Strada or their Apple Watch because it’s familiar and consistent. At this early stage, Prevayl’s online community isn’t yet live.</p><p>For now, the company is focusing on the UK and Ireland, but Prevayl’s spokesperson told me that the US will be a priority.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB MX500 internal SSD" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">1TB MX500 internal SSD</a> is on sale for $85, which is 15 percent off its normal price and only a few dollars shy of a record low. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2TB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">2TB</a> model is down to $168 as well, and if you don&#39;t need that much extra space, you can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:500GB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">500GB</a> version for only $53.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba" id="9c3ab95ef2c14a3a9e6ef59a06ff5d23" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial MX500 (1TB) at Amazon - $85</a><p>The MX500 should fit into most computers thanks to its 2.5-inch design, and it supports sequential read speeds of up to 560 MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 510 MB/s. It also comes with AES 256-bit hardware encryption as well as integrated power-loss immunity, the latter of which should protect your data even if your power gets cut unexpectedly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re looking for an internal drive that&#39;s a bit more high-end, or one that works with the PS5, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC">Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus</a> in 1TB is down to $145, which is 19 percent off its regular rate and an all-time low. This drive made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">PS5 SSD guide</a> because, even at its normal price, it&#39;s a solid budget option for the console as long as you&#39;re willing to supply your own heatsink. It&#39;s an NVMe PCIe SSD with read speeds up to 6,600 MB/s and write speeds up to 5,000 MB/s, and it&#39;s optimized for high-performance gaming and computing.</p><p>For those with tighter budgets who still want to expand their PS5 storage options, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s X6" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf">Crucial&#39;s X6</a> external drive in 1TB is 38 percent off right now, bringing it down to $80. Yes, you can use portable SSDs with the console, but there are some limitations: when connected to a PS5, an external drive can only be used to play PS4 titles or store PS5 games. That means you can move a PS5 title out of cold storage when you want to play it, which may be best if you have slower internet speeds impeding your ability to download games quickly. We like the X6 for its fast 540 MB/s read speeds, durable design that&#39;s shock, drop, vibration and temperature resistant and its compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC" id="a63144a263674c3884a2cfb8cdcc79dc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial P5 Plus (1TB) at Amazon - $145</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf" id="e08f7504c3364993b06ddf25f497be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial X6 (1TB) at Amazon - $80</a><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Black Friday typically brings decent sales on these devices, and we&#39;re already starting to see good discounts across the web. There are a few different models at this point: the latest 3rd-generation AirPods were updated just last month with a new design, improved audio quality and longer battery life, while the AirPods Pro remain the best sounding Apple earbuds and now they come with a MagSafe charging case. You can still grab the 2nd-generation AirPods as well, and the AirPods Max are best for those that prefer over-ear headphones.

It takes great photos thanks to the 24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor, which delivers sharp images with natural colors and skin tones. It also comes with Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel eye-detect autofocus tech, so most of them will be in focus, too. And for social or tourist shooting, it comes with a pop-up flash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, it can handle 4K video at 24 fps, albeit with a 1.6 times crop. That, along with the flip-up display, makes it very useful as a vlogging camera — and it&#39;s even good for social media because it can also shoot vertical video. The 15-45mm lens, meanwhile, offers a decent zoom range for most types of shooting.</p><p>The downsides are the lack of a viewfinder, though that helps keep the size very small. It also offers a limited lens selection and relatively slow burst shooting speeds. However, it&#39;s a real bargain at $450, which is a cheaper price than most cameras <em>without</em> any lens at all.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

That’s the conclusion of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721002589">new research</a> examining whether targeted warnings could reduce hate speech on the platform.</p><p>Researchers at New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics found that personalized warnings alerting Twitter users to the consequences of their behavior reduced the number of tweets with hateful language a week after. While more study is needed, the experiment suggests that there is a “potential path forward for platforms seeking to reduce the use of hateful language by users,” according to Mustafa Mikdat Yildirim, the lead author of the paper.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the experiment, researchers identified accounts at risk of being suspended for breaking Twitter’s rules against hate speech. They looked for people who had used at least one word contained in “hateful language dictionaries” over the previous week, who also followed at least one account that had recently been suspended after using such language.</p><p>From there, the researchers created test accounts with personas such as “hate speech warner,” and used the accounts to tweet warnings at these individuals. They tested out several variations, but all had roughly the same message: that using hate speech put them at risk of being suspended, and that it had already happened to someone they follow.</p><p>“The user @account you follow was suspended, and I suspect this was because of hateful language,” reads one sample message shared in the paper. “If you continue to use hate speech, you might get suspended temporarily.” In another variation, the account doing the warning identified themselves as a professional researcher, while also letting the person know they were at risk of being suspended. “We tried to be as credible and convincing as possible,” Yildirim tells Engadget.</p><p>The researchers found that the warnings were effective, at least in the short term. “Our results show that only one warning tweet sent by an account with no more than 100 followers can decrease the ratio of tweets with hateful language by up to 10%,” the authors write. Interestingly, they found that messages that were “more politely phrased” led to even greater declines, with a decrease of up to 20 percent. “We tried to increase the politeness of our message by basically starting our warning by saying that ‘oh, we respect your right to free speech, but on the other hand keep in mind that your hate speech might harm others,’” Yildirim says.</p><p>In the paper, Yildirim and his co-authors note that their test accounts only had around 100 followers each, and that they weren’t associated with an authoritative entity. But if the same type of warnings were to come from Twitter itself, or an NGO or other organization, then the warnings may be even more useful. “The thing that we learned from this experiment is that the real mechanism at play could be the fact that we actually let these people know that there&#39;s some account, or some entity, that is watching and monitoring their behavior,” Yildirim says. “The fact that their use of hate speech is seen by someone else could be the most important factor that led these people to decrease their hate speech.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/personalized-warnings-could-reduce-hate-speech-on-twitter-researchers-say-110029755.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ff29775-1845-4096-82ce-b74ac02dd63a</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 11:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637545026</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T01:37:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6903eb10-9d49-11eb-9ebc-d0c616a3ce25" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6903eb10-9d49-11eb-9ebc-d0c616a3ce25" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 13, 2021 (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[App Photo Illustrations]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
