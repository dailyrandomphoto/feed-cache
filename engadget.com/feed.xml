Headsets have come a long way since the launch of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive five years ago. Standalone devices like the Oculus Quest 2 let you hop into virtual reality anywhere, while also giving you the flexibility of streaming virtual reality from powerful PCs. And if you don&#39;t care about dealing with a wired headset, there are a plethora of high-end options out there. Most importantly, there are plenty of memorable VR experiences like <em>Vader Immortal</em> and <em>Half-LIfe: Alyx </em>that you can&#39;t experience outside of a headset.</p><h2>So what makes a good VR headset?</h2><p>I tend to judge them on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It&#39;s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto them. But it takes skill to craft something that&#39;s well balanced and doesn&#39;t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a low field of view makes it look like you’re looking through a pair of binoculars, which limits the sense of “presence” you can feel in VR. But a wide field of view can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth.</p><p>And when it comes to controllers, the best options fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has practically adopted the design of Oculus&#39;s excellent touch controllers, but we&#39;re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve&#39;s finger tracking gamepads.</p><h2>Best VR headset for most people: Oculus Quest 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9f7c78c0-fa04-11eb-af24-b0871afa1509" alt="Oculus Quest 2 VR headset" data-uuid="618638d4-eaa6-37bb-af37-30fc64cf3008"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Almost a year since its release, the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4">Oculus Quest 2</a> remains the best VR option for the vast majority of consumers. It&#39;s completely cordless, relatively inexpensive (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:starting at $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">starting at $299</a>) and it&#39;s comfortable to wear for long sessions. There&#39;s also a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it&#39;s bundled with Oculus&#39;s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.</p><p>The Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution 1832x1920 per eye, the highest we&#39;ve seen from Oculus. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2&#39;s field of view isn&#39;t the best — it&#39;s been measured at just around 90 degrees — but it&#39;s still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also <a href="https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/i-boosted-my-quest-2s-field-of-view-halfway-to-a-valve-index-vrcover-foam-pads-fov-rated/">use different face pads</a> to increase its field of view a bit. And if you want an even more comfortable fit, you can snag <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Oculus&#39;s Elite headstrap for $49" href="https://amzn.to/2U5v8UP">Oculus&#39;s Elite headstrap for $49</a> (or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$129 with a built-in battery and case" href="https://amzn.to/3xCtwQi">$129 with a built-in battery and case</a>).</p><p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html#:~:text=Working%20with%20the%20US%20Consumer,with%20its%20latest%20VR%20headset.&amp;text=Facebook%20is%20also%20halting%20sales,to%20every%20Quest%202%20package.">recalled the foam inserts</a> from the original model and is offering silicone covers to make the headset more comfortable. We didn&#39;t experience any issues during our review, or during the past year of usage, but there have been enough complaints for Facebook to take action. The base $299 Quest 2 will also come with 128GB of storage when it returns to store shelves on August 24th. That&#39;s double the storage of the original model, giving you even more room to cram in games and VR apps.</p><p>The Quest 2 may not offer the best overall VR experience, but it&#39;s certainly the most accessible headset on the market.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299</a></p><h2>Best PC VR headset under $600: HP Reverb G2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/221fc520-fa05-11eb-bf1f-39ee1a30d1b7" alt="HP Reverb G2 VR headset" data-uuid="3ea9b8cf-9fc6-38ee-95ab-edc9a28d5b83"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don&#39;t care about wireless VR, and you want to invest a bit more in a high-quality PC headset, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2" href="https://fave.co/3jmfJs7">HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2</a> is meant for you. It was developed in cooperation with Valve and has some of the best features from the pricier Index headset, like near-field speakers. The Reverb G2 also has sharp screens, offering 2,160 by 2,160 pixels per eye, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a relatively wide 114-degree field of view.</p><p>It&#39;s also the first Windows Mixed Reality headset to include four tracking sensors, which helps to ensure more accurate VR tracking, especially during fast-paced games. I also give HP  credit for making a headset that’s extremely comfortable thanks to its luxurious amount of cushioning around the eye-piece and rear strap.</p><p>The Reverb G2&#39;s motion controllers weren&#39;t my favorite, but they&#39;re still a big step up from HP&#39;s previous model. You could also upgrade it to use Valve&#39;s finger-tracking controllers, but that involves snagging SteamVR sensors and a lot more setup. Still, it&#39;s nice to have the upgrade path available.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Reverb G2 at HP - $599" href="https://fave.co/3jmfJs7">Buy Reverb G2 at HP - $599</a></p><h2>Best PC VR headset for gamers: Valve Index</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/63597680-fa05-11eb-9f9f-91fe11b5cb03" alt="Valve Index VR headset" data-uuid="df85da96-734a-3fbd-9abe-02ac876f04fb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://fave.co/377HC11">Valve&#39;s Index kit</a> remains one of the best high-end VR solutions on the market. For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we&#39;ve seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it&#39;s still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I&#39;d gladly lose a few pixels to get a smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond any other consumer headset.</p><p>As a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it&#39;s wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it&#39;s not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you&#39;ll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.</p><p>Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>feel like a dream. It&#39;s unfortunate that other VR games haven&#39;t fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/377HC11">Buy Index at Valve - $999</a></p><h2>Best VR quality, no matter the cost: HTC Vive Pro 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="6ae80b9d-4f42-3655-b669-12c7a13e7b8a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2</a> is the best-looking PC VR I&#39;ve seen. It has an astoundingly sharp 5K screen and a solid 120Hz refresh rate. Just be prepared: the full kit, which includes the headset, two SteamVR sensors and wand controllers, costs $1,399. You can also buy the headset separately for $799 as an upgrade to the original Vive Pro, or the Valve Index.</p><p>For the price you get a well-balanced and supremely comfortable VR headset. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html#:~:text=The%20HTC%20Vive%20Pro%202,make%20it%20a%20tough%20sell.">Pro 2</a> is a clear sign that Valve has practically perfected the art of making high-end hardware. I&#39;m less impressed with the large wand controllers, which are exactly the same as the ones that came with the original HTC Vive in 2016. They&#39;re functional, but they&#39;re nowhere near as ergonomic as Oculus&#39;s Touch Controllers.</p><p>I&#39;m mainly recommending the Pro 2 here based on the astounding quality of the headset.</p><p>True VR fans may want to just grab that separately along with SteamVR base stations and Valve&#39;s finger-tracking controllers.

While it’s still a very comfortable headset, and it does magic with the PS4’s limited power, it’s not the smartest buy today. That’s particularly true when Sony has been eager to chat up its sequel VR headset for the PS5. We know that device will come with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-vr-controllers-121517263.html">more modern controllers</a> and have hardware similar to PC VR headsets. The only problem is that you’ll have to wait for it — Sony says it won’t be ready in 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-vr-headsets-140012529.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85ff34bf-f6f7-4878-80c1-5f155e7af14b</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628774081</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T13:15:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35896d1-eb10-11eb-b7ff-c8fd80773144" width="2000" height="1148" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35896d1-eb10-11eb-b7ff-c8fd80773144" width="2000" height="1148" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok limits the visibility of teens' videos amid safety push]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok&#39;s determination to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/furthering-our-safety-and-privacy-commitments-for-teens-on-tiktok-us">clean up its feeds</a> now includes significant limits on its app for the teenage crowd. The social video service is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/furthering-our-safety-and-privacy-commitments-for-teens-on-tiktok-us">limiting</a> the visibility of teens&#39; videos, with the most restrictions applying to the youngest users. Teens aged 13 to 15 are set to private by default, and will have to decide who can see a video the first time they post. They&#39;ll have that option for every video they post beyond that, and they won&#39;t have access to Duet or Stitch features.</p><p>Older teens will see restrictions, too. TikTok will turn off Direct Messages by default for 16- and 17-year-olds joining the service for the first time, and ask existing users to review their settings if they haven&#39;t tried DMs before. The company will also double-check before those older teens enable downloads for their videos.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The social media giant will try to promote healthy usage habits, too. Notifications will turn off for teens under 16 starting at 9PM local time, while 16- and 17-year-olds will receive their alerts until 10PM.

The focus is clear, however — TikTok doesn&#39;t want stories of teens facing bullies, creeps and other abusers that found them through public videos and unsolicited messages. In theory, the restrictions provide a gentler introduction to TikTok that helps younger audiences understand the consequences of their actions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-limits-teen-access-130931754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98f73a69-b8f7-407b-bc6c-afb6c077724d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:09:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628773774</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T13:09:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LOIC VENANCE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenager presents a smartphone with the logo of Chinese social network Tik Tok, on January 21, 2021 in Nantes, western France.

But today marks the first time that it is launching a<em> flagship</em> phone to the global market as an independent company. Free from the US sanctions that rocked its former parent, Honor is once again able to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-smartphones-google-apps-50-series-huawei-171758485.html">American software</a> (hello, Android 11) and silicon (hello, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Qualcomm</a>). This then, is the start of Honor’s second life, which is beginning with the launch of the Magic3, its first — well, “<em>first</em>” — flagship.</p><p>Historically, Honor was Huawei’s budget play, offering a surprising level of quality and tech for relatively low prices. The Honor 20, for instance, was the sort of phone that made you forget about the need to buy a flagship handset despite its modest sticker. Now, of course, with the freedom (read: obligation) to create high-end handsets, Honor is shuffling its brands. The high end will now be dominated by Magic-branded handsets, while the numbered line (like the Honor 50) will sit in the middle, and the low end now the domain of the X-Series.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design-wise, Honor’s apple did not fall far from Huawei’s tree. From several angles, the Magic3 looks like a Huawei Mate, and this is not the only time I’ll bring this up. Given the sharing of IP and technology between the two companies before the split, this is not a huge surprise. I’m sure that many of the handsets Honor releases over the next couple of years will have that whiff of shared DNA, and like the Mate this phone has a waterfall display, with an 89-degree curve down both sides of the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f235b700-fb64-11eb-bf75-8b98d187afb5" style="height:690;width:1920;" alt="Honor Magic 3" data-uuid="707cdb14-39c4-3ec8-a293-5e196038fb45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honor</div></figure><p>There are three Magic3 handsets in the range, the vanilla Magic3, Magic3 Pro, and the Magic3 Pro+. Every member of this trio is packing a 6.67-inch, 2,272 x 1,344, always-on flexible OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR 10+. There’s a 94.82 screen-to-body ratio, the ideal fact to wheel out when you need to impress folks in bars, too. The cut-out for imaging plays host to a 13-megapixel, f/2.4 wide camera with a 100-degree wide-angle lens no matter what model you opt for. Although the higher end Pro and Pro+ models are the only ones that pair it with a 3D Time of Flight sensor for face unlocking.&nbsp;</p><p>The real interest, however, is in the lenses on the back of the phone, and Honor is throwing all but the dishwasher at this phone. Arranged in a setup the company is calling &quot;The Eye of Muse,&quot; the regular handsets get a 50-megapixel, f/1.9 lens with Sony&#39;s IMX766 image sensor, a 64-megapixel, f/2.2 monochrome camera and a 13-megapixel, 120-degree f/2.2 ultra-wide camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pro, meanwhile, adds a 64-megapixel, f/3.5 OIS telephoto camera with a 3.5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid zoom and 100x digital zoom. The Pro+, meanwhile, swaps out that IMX766 for the larger, f/1.9 1/1.28-inch IMX700 with OIS. You&#39;ll get that 64-megapixel monochrome camera with an f/1.8 aperture, a 64-megapixel 126-degree, f/2.4 ultra-wide camera and that same telephoto lens. (You&#39;ll also get a TOF sensor and color temperature sensor for more accurate imaging.)</p><p>Honor also said that this IMAX-enhanced camera can be used to shoot your own cinema-quality films, a boast previously used to sell Huawei’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-huawei-s-mate-30-pro-has-quad-camera-array-and-a-vegan-leather-o.html">Mate 30</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-mate-40-123031700.html">Mate 40</a> (told you I’d mention this again). Honor says that, unlike those handsets, it has developed a custom, mobile-friendly version of the filming standard Log, dubbed MagicLog, which is designed to shoot high-quality video.</p><p>Broadly speaking, Log is a way of recording footage that preserves as much of the dynamic range and tone as possible. When viewed straight from the camera, the footage looks weird and it requires a lot of post-processing and grading. In order to save ordinary users from that agony, Honor teamed up with professional colorist <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572972/">Bryan McMahan</a> to create eight pre-set grades which work like Instagram filters.</p><div id="0e366ea5ff4b4fdf9d144fb18d5f3f92"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXhl9gTxz9Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Honor said that one minute of MagicLog footage will take up around 500MB of memory, so if you want to shoot a film with one of these, invest in one with lots of storage. And this is a feature that we’d love to test in depth in future, because if this in some crazy way does turn out to work, it could be a very big deal.</p><p>Beyond imaging, Honor wanted to talk up the various software engines that it has designed to help squeeze better performance out of the Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-snapdragon-888-plus-under-screen-camera-133605155.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G SoC found in the Pro and Pro+. (The regular Magic3 is using Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon 888.) Long story short, Honor (and Huawei before it) uses an AI layer which has been trained to monitor for challenging processes and adjust power to compensate. It says that, for the Magic3, you can expect to see faster and more stable 5G and gaming performance when using the phone. Then there is OS Turbo X (Apple’s lawyers, I’m sure, will be taking notes) which, it’s claimed, will be able to keep the system running at peak performance for longer. Honor’s representatives said that this system alone will ensure that, after using it for 36 months, you’ll only experience a 3.8 percent drop in performance compared to the day you bought the phone.</p><p>And then there’s “Smart RAM,” which sounds like the sort of RAM-doubling scamware that we saw back in the days of Windows 3.1. Honor’s representatives said that, in times of need, the Magic3 can bounce some of the data from its RAM to the phone’s flash memory. Now it’s not clear if the company is trying to pass virtual memory off as some sort of new-fangled innovation or if there’s some clever new implementation here. Honor says that, no matter if you have the 8GB or 12GB variant, you can expect this system to offer you an additional 2GB of headroom when required. I have no idea if file transfer speeds between the SoC and flash memory are fast enough to make this a viable, boastworthy feature for a new flagship handset.</p><p>The company has also offered some smart privacy features, like obscuring message notifications when you cast video to a TV, as well as the ability to strip metadata from images before you share them to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Honor hasn’t said how long this device will last on a single charge, but that 4,600mAh battery should have plenty of staying power. All three variants support 66W wired SuperCharge, and you can get up to 50 percent of your battery re-juiced with just 15 minutes of connection. In addition, the Pro and Pro+ models both support 50W wireless charging, should you feel the need.</p><p>Magic3 is available in four colors: Black, White, &quot;Golden Hour&quot; and &quot;Blue Hour,&quot; the latter pair are a pinkish-orangey hue, and a deep royal blue. The standard colors are available in Honor&#39;s usual coating, while the two hours are available in vegan leather. The 3 Pro+, meanwhile, comes in either a ceramic black or white ceramic body with pinstripe texturing which, at first blush, looks extraordinary. All of the handsets are IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, which is about the minimum you can expect from a phone these days.&nbsp;</p><p>The Honor Magic3 series will make its debut in Mainland China, with news about arrivals in western markets coming in short order. CEO George Zhao did, however, reveal pricing for the handset when it reaches Europe, at the very least. The Magic3, with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, will retail for €899 ($1,054), while the Magic 3 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will set you back €1,099 ($1,289). Flagship-lovers, looking to grab the Magic3 Pro+ with 12GB RAM and 512GB Storage, meanwhile, will have to fork over at least €1,499 ($1,758).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic3-flagship-125020517.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">446c057c-8da6-4714-bf65-4cc096235a6b</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:50:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628772623</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T12:50:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor Magic 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor Magic3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard loses three senior designers amid sexual harassment lawsuit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three senior designers pivotal to <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>World of Warcraft </em>are no longer at Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113"><em>Kotaku</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>confirmed the trio of abrupt departures after initially learning about them from internal sources. They include <em>Diablo 4 </em>game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and<em> World of Warcraft </em>designer Jonathan LeCraft. Insiders told the publication that the three developers names had been removed from Blizzard’s internal directory and Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>News of the shakeup arrives as Activision Blizzard is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">grappling</a> with allegations of systemic gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The incendiary accusations, which were revealed in a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), have already led to damaging repercussions for the publisher. Blizzard is facing an internal outcry, with workers staging walkouts and demanding corrective action. Earlier this month, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">lost its president</a> and was hit with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">lawsuit by investors</a> irked by its handling of the crisis. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has admitted that the publisher&#39;s original response to the DFEH filing was &quot;tone-deaf.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company did not give a specific reason for the latest departures, two of the designers (namely McCree and LeCraft) were reportedly pictured in photos of the infamous &quot;Cosby Suite.&quot; This was the hotel room explicitly mentioned in the DFEH lawsuit where male employees allegedly harassed women at company events. As <em>Overwatch </em>fans may know, the game features a cowboy called Jesse McCree named after the now ex-Blizzard employee. It remains to be seen if the publisher changes the character&#39;s name.</p><p>“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,&quot; a spokesperson for Blizzard told <em>Kotaku</em>. &quot;We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253af6cf-2b1b-405c-b456-5af76d409bce</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:19:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628773132</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T12:59:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook may be forced to sell Giphy following UK regulator findings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK&#39;s competition regulator has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns?=0">found</a> that Facebook&#39;s acquisition of GIF-sharing platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">Giphy</a> will harm competition within social media and digital advertising. As part of its provisional <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d39ce90e0705481fbfb8/Facebook_GIPHY_-_Summary_of_Provisional_Findings.pdf">decision</a>, the watchdog voiced concerns that Facebook could prevent rivals including TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy, a service they already use. It added that Facebook could also require customers of the GIF platform to hand over more data in return for access. If its objections are confirmed as part of the ongoing review, the regulator said it could force Facebook to unwind the deal and to sell off Giphy in its entirety.</p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ultimately determined that the deal stands to increase Facebook&#39;s sizeable market power. Together, its suite of apps — including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram — account for 70 percent of social media activity and are accessed at least once a month by 80 percent of internet users, the CMA said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond social media, the watchdog suggested that the acquisition could remove a potential challenger to Facebook in the $5.5 billion display advertising market. Citing Facebook&#39;s termination of Giphy&#39;s paid ad partnerships following the deal, the regulator said the move had effectively stopped the company&#39;s ad expansion (including to additional countries like the UK) in its tracks. This in turn had an impact on innovation in the broader advertising sector, the CMA explained.</p><p>Facebook&#39;s announcement last May that it was acquiring Giphy, with plans to integrate it with Instagram, for a reported $400 million immediately raised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">alarm bells</a> for regulators. The social network is facing antitrust complaints in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">US</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-facebook-antitrust-probe-105245913.html">EU</a> over its social media and advertising monopolies, respectively. At the same time, the UK has ramped up its scrutiny of Big Tech by creating a dedicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-digital-markets-unit-big-tech-031053255.html">Digital Markets Unit</a> to oversee the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple. The fledgling agency sits within the CMA and is designed to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Today, the CMA echoed those principles in its initial decision. The regulator said that it would &quot;take the necessary actions&quot; to protect users if it concludes that the merger is detrimental to competition. It will now consult on its findings as part of the reviews process. A final decision is slated for October 6th.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson told Engadget<em>&nbsp;</em>that it &quot;disagrees&quot; with the CMA&#39;s preliminary findings. “We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence. As we have demonstrated, this merger is in the best interest of people and businesses in the UK - and around the world - who use GIPHY and our services. We will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”&nbsp;</p><p>It previously argued that Giphy has no operations in the UK, meaning that the CMA has no jurisdiction over the deal. In addition, it has claimed that Giphy&#39;s paid services cannot be classified as display advertising under the regulator&#39;s own market definition.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c68f0768-f104-42a1-8060-3df9ba1fa808</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 11:35:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628769255</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T11:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Erin Scott / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019.

What a lot of people had written off as <em>Family Guy</em>- or <em>Rick and Morty</em>-Trek ended up being a wholesome love letter to the history of the franchise. It was filled with plenty of low-brow humor, sure, but it also showcased characters who genuinely cared about each other and what they do. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-august-12-213816677.html">season two</a> is more of the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Lower Decks</em> takes its name from a season-seven <em>The Next Generation</em> episode that revolved around the lives of four ensigns, and the parts they played in a mission that only the bridge crew really understood the full scope of. It’s generally considered one of the best episodes of the franchise, which meant that anything that even vaguely referenced it had a lot to live up to. Luckily, <em>Lower Decks</em> creator and executive producer Mike McMahan was a big fan with deep knowledge of Trek. He is also the creator of the <a href="https://twitter.com/tng_s8?lang=en">@TNG_S8</a> parody Twitter account, as well as a veteran of animated shows like <em>South Park</em>, <em>Axe Cop</em> and, yes, <em>Rick and Morty</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe37c6e0-f945-11eb-bffb-387157ecf4fd" alt="Pictured (L-R): Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler, Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford and No&#xc3;&#xab;l Wells as Ensign Tendi of the CBS All Access series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

(It turned out to be a party in honor of the senior officers, which confused our protagonists even more.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/31e46250-f946-11eb-befa-04fd9e959d20" alt="Pictured Gillian Vigman as Dr. T&#39;ana, Jerry O&#39;Connell as Commander Ransom, Dawnn Lewis as Captain Freeman, Paul Scheer as Lt.

But Star Trek doesn’t have a good track record of sticking to a concept. The majority of shows since <em>TNG</em> have started out as one thing and become something else over the course of their runs. All shows evolve, but the changes in Trek have been obvious and purposeful. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ds9-kingdom-solar-opposites-170043593.html"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a> was intended to be a “frontier outpost” type of show, showing the long-term relationship between the Starfleet and one of the planets it encountered, Bajor. By season three they were given a warship, and season four brought in <em>TNG</em>-veteran Worf and a war with the Klingon Empire.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> operated on the premise of “what if a Starfleet ship was lost far from home?” And it stuck with that, sure, but it also continued to operate like any other Starfleet vessel over seven seasons, and the ship remained in surprisingly good condition despite the lack of spacedocks for repair — something that frustrated writer Ronald D. Moore and later spurred him to create the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/battlestar%20galactica"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a> reboot (the title ship was a wreck by the finale). They also ended up re-establishing contact with the Federation in later seasons, which dampened the whole “alone in a strange quadrant” theme.</p><div id="0f8cede6cc884f58ae30e477e765c3d8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxdKo0eXUKY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Enterprise</em> wasn’t even called Star Trek until its third season. But still, though it was a show that promised to show us the early origins of Starfleet and the Federation, the first two seasons got bogged down in a “Temporal Cold War” and later episodes brought in 24th-century-era baddies like the Borg and Ferengi.</p><p>The latest concept switcheroo was the premiere <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> Trek show, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Discovery</em></a>. The producers touted it as the first series where the captain was not the main character, with the program focusing on Commander Michael Burnham instead. This sounded great in theory, as it could show us a different side of Starfleet. In practice, however, even if Burnham wasn’t the captain the entire universe seemed to revolve around her anyway: the mysterious “Red Angel〞of season two turned out to be her mother (and her). The show ended up jettisoning its 23rd century setting after that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-trailer-040651412.html">traveling to the 32nd century</a> to a galaxy with a Federation in tatters. As of the end of season three Burnham became the captain anyway. So much for any <em>Lower Decks</em>-esque perspective on that show.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8fa67590-f946-11eb-97ef-5abb2fa37bb0" data-uuid="0c37f1dd-e756-3180-865f-81c694a5e3d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Season two of <em>Lower Decks</em> starts off a bit shaky in that regard — after the events of the last few episodes, Mariner is now BFF with the captain (who is also her mother) and Boimler is a bridge officer on the <em>USS Titan</em>. Neither of them feel like the scrappy underdog anymore. At least Tendi and Rutherford are still pretty minor players, though Tendi is alarmed at sudden changes in Rutherford’s personality and worries she may be losing his friendship.</p><p>The premiere finds Mariner having the carte blanche to go on any side missions she wants, and in one of these authorized-unauthorized missions she accidentally turns first officer Jack Ransom into a god-like being set on taking over a planet. The latter event is, at least, a pretty standard plot contrivance for Star Trek. Where <em>Lower Decks</em> stands apart is that as Ransom is threatening the <em>Cerritos</em> and banging away at its shields, the camera cuts to Tendi attacking Rutherford in a corridor, afraid that his new personality traits mean he’s suffering a serious disease, or that he just doesn’t like her anymore.

At the same time, it&#39;s making it more difficult for contributors to join the Partner Program based on follower numbers and other criteria, the platform <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">announced</a> yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>When Medium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-23-mediums-subscription-offers-all-you-can-read-stories-for-5.html">launched</a> its Partner Platform, it used a Netflix-like model that let subscribers access all content for $5 per month of $50 per year. Contributors would then get paid based on how much time members spent reading their content — if a member spent 10 percent of their time on one writer&#39;s work, that writer would get 10 percent of the subscriber&#39;s payments. At the same time, if a reader converted to a paying member within 30 days of reading a writer&#39;s work, the writer would credit for that time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the new model, writers in the Partner Program will have a personalized referral landing page. If a reader purchases a subscription via a writer&#39;s page, the writer will get half the fee for the entire life of the subscription — minus payment processing fees. So, for every 100 members who sign up via a partner&#39;s referral landing page, that partner will make $201 per month.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>You can leverage your landing page however you’d like: share it on social platforms, link to it on Medium post pages, or include it on your profile. Directing your readers to this page is completely optional.</p></blockquote><p>At the same time, when a non-paying reader subscribes to a writer&#39;s email, they&#39;ll automatically be given the option to convert to a Medium member. If they do, that will count toward the writer&#39;s referral earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Medium noted that subscriber referral earnings will be in addition to Partner Program earnings based on member read time. Presumably, however, there would be less money to go around from referred subscribers, since half their revenue would be going to the referring partner.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Medium has made it a bit more difficult to become a partner. Going forward, writers must have at least 100 follower and one published Medium story. Even if you meet all those requirements, you might lose your status if you don&#39;t publish anything within a six month period. Existing partners will retain their status until the end of 2021, and if they haven&#39;t reached the requirements at that point, they&#39;ll be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Medium&#39;s new model appears to be a response to Substack in particular, which pays writers based on their paid subscriber totals. Substack is more generous to individual writers, taking just 10 percent of their revenue compared to the 50 percent for medium, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Unlike Substack, though, Medium readers get access to everything on the platform, not just a single writer&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mediums-partner-program-will-start-paying-writers-for-subscriber-referrals-044932271.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7540bdd1-22cc-4bbb-8864-333abc5ba90b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:49:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628743772</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T04:49:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pheelings Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of black man hands typing on a laptop sitting on a desk at home]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black man hands typing on a laptop at home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[German animal shelter is posting profiles of adoptable pets on Tinder]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Munich Animal Welfare Association has taken <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/purrfect-match-animal-shelter-puts-lonely-pets-tinder-2021-08-11/">a unique approach</a> to matching its resident adoptable pets with their new forever homes: putting their profiles on popular dating app, Tinder.

Penned by Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and co-sponsored by Amy Klobuchar, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amy-klobuchar-antitrust-senate-bill-171401466.html">chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee</a>, the proposed legislation would &quot;prevent app stores from disadvantaging developers.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Open App Markets Act</a> reads like a wishlist of items groups like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-spotify-and-others-form-alliance-against-app-store-dominance-135026221.html">Coalition for App Fairness</a> have advocated for in their fight against Apple and Google. So it should come as no surprise the organization has come out in support of the proposed legislation. One of the most noteworthy provisions included in the bill&#39;s current iteration is a clause that would prohibit app marketplace owners from forcing third-party developers to use a payment system they own. Another provision aimed almost exclusively at Apple would force platform holders to allow consumers to sideload software and install third-party app stores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Payment systems have been one of the issues at the heart of the recent antitrust movement. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">kicked Epic Games off the App Store</a> after the studio implemented a way for <em>Fortnit</em>e players to skirt its 30 percent fee. Google, meanwhile, announced at the end of 2020 that it would give developers until later this year to make their apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">compliant with the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>.</p><p>&quot;The legislation would help create a more competitive app marketplace that will ignite innovation in the digital economy, and provide more options for American consumers,&quot; the Coalition for App Fairness said in a statement.</p><p>Outside of the CAF, organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Internet Accountability Project support the bill. Of course, introducing legislation and passing it are two very different things. You can be sure Apple and Google will lobby to soften the Open App Markets Act since it threatens the way they do business.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-open-app-markets-act-introduction-221732872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0911950b-30e0-46b0-b568-0b641b024253</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 22:17:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628720255</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T22:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Savusia Konstantin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan - July 6 2019: Fortnite app in play smartphone. close-up on screen iphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Iphone Apps.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter rolls out redesign with proprietary Chirp font]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you went to scroll through your Twitter timeline today, you may have noticed that things look a bit different.

The company introduced the font back in January.

The Netflix programs were always said to be padded out, with more installments than they really needed per season. The <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> era has given us shows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-runtime-episode-length-163011729.html">fewer</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html">episodes</a>, but that hasn’t deterred complaints about slow pacing. <em>What If…?</em>, premiering this week on the service, has a different problem: It’s frantic and rushed, like a podcast episode played at 1.5x speed.</p><p>The concept behind <em>What If…?</em> is simple. Take a pivotal moment from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, change one thing, see what happens. In the premiere episode, set during the events of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>, Peggy Carter chooses to stay in the room where Steve is receiving the super soldier serum. Steve gets shot, forcing Peggy to jump into the machine and get bulked up in his place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a841792d6fc94381b796ec345168bcb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L23B6577hA4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>You’d need to be intimately familiar with the original movie to spot the difference, which is why the omniscient narrator is there to point it out. It’s probably the only time the episode stops to catch its breath.</p><p>The problem is that this is a half-hour show attempting to present an alternate version of a two-hour movie. It isn’t even enough to just say that Captain Carter has super powers; they feel the need to show how the events of the entire movie play out, down to the final battle with the Red Skull. There isn’t a lot of time for character development, because they assume you already know the characters well from seeing them on the silver screen. (Also, why is she Captain Carter and not Captain Britain?)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5accd640-facf-11eb-97af-d849ff554a1f" style="height:1838;width:3835;" alt="Captain Carter with her mighty shield" data-uuid="9103a4eb-bdd1-3090-82a2-95d586d281a2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It runs from plot point to plot point, a highlight reel of the film with some small and a lot of big changes. You’ll probably want to rewatch the original movie either before or after, just because there are so many winks and nudges to it that the episode simply cannot stand alone. It’s like a DVD extra and fan fiction had a baby — which, to be fair, is what the original comic felt like.</p><p>The difference here is that this is a version of <em>What If...?</em> that gets to play in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mcu">MCU</a> sandbox, with the voices and likenesses to boot (except for Hugo Weaving, who is once again replaced by Ross Marquand as the Red Skull). Animation is the only way to pull it off, given that the cast and setting changes with every episode so a live action production would be prohibitively expensive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94fb6610-facf-11eb-9fff-ce21547852b7" style="height:1748;width:3840;" alt="The Watcher" data-uuid="bf0431ba-f891-3cc4-8f70-433799625d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But, despite being owned by one of the most famous animation studios in the world, Marvel Studios  went with third-party animators. It’s a cel shaded style, which is more often used in video games and here looks a lot like rotoscoping. It’s sort of stiff and awkward, with more attention paid to making characters look like their actors instead of being more fluid or expressive. It’s a shame, given that Disney’s 2012 short film <a href="https://youtu.be/XrqSF2OOz_M"><em>Paperman</em></a> utilized a hybrid 2D/3D style which looks similar to this, but with a lot more personality.</p><p>Future episodes will explore other divergences from the MCU, like T’Challa becoming Star Lord or Tony Stark getting saved by Killmonger. So it’s likely some episodes will be far more enjoyable than others based on their conceit alone, though Captain Carter is still a solid start. But a good concept can’t completely overcome animation and pacing issues.</p><div id="d201d0e0455d42e3a69b85ab8b580483"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jt64UwA9O00?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ebc575e-6e88-441b-a399-209e749578b1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 18:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628706047</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T18:21:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2ee82b0-face-11eb-bdbf-d139fa8b6c62" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2ee82b0-face-11eb-bdbf-d139fa8b6c62" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Captain Carter and the Howling Commandos]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel What If...?]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer's latest Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds include ANC and RGB lighting]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Razer came out with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-29-razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds.html">Hammerhead True Wireless</a> earbuds in 2019, it was one of the first companies to include a low-latency Bluetooth mode for gaming. That&#39;s a feature that has since made its way to various <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-seoul-gaming-true-wireless-earbuds-announcement-080005653.html">headphones</a>, and the true wireless market has only become more competitive in the meantime. Enter the second-generation Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds, which cost $30 more than their $100 predecessor but include additional premium features.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a847eb10-facc-11eb-befd-72fcbb160a2c" alt="Razer Inline" data-uuid="7bbf6bf8-1b19-3251-88f6-ca71d5934b5e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>To start, they include both ANC and RGB lighting.

Using the Razer Audio App, you can customize the color and brightness of the Chroma RGB. The software also lets you tweak EQ settings to your liking. Other improvements include support for Bluetooth 5.2 and a new design Razer claims improves sound isolation and fit for most people.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The amount of battery life you can look forward to eeking out of the 2021 model will vary greatly depending on your use of the RGB and ANC features. With both turned off, Razer claims you can look forward to six-and-a-half hours of playtime on a single charge and an additional 26 hours with the included charging case. However, those figures drop to four and 20 hours when you enable both features. While not necessarily great, that&#39;s still an improvement on the 19 hours of total listening time the previous model offered.</p><p>You can buy the Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds starting today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3s8NHnA">Razer&#39;s website</a> for $129.99.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds-2nd-gen-annoucement-175941118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d2c6bdd-39bc-4433-b88d-5e80677d2b07</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 17:59:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628707613</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T18:47:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/61a758a0-fad4-11eb-b5ef-fe72cfd80448" width="1349" height="858" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/61a758a0-fad4-11eb-b5ef-fe72cfd80448" width="1349" height="858" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A studio shot of the Razer Hammerhead earbuds with blue background lighting.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Hammerhead earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android 12 is almost ready as latest beta focuses on platform stability]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has released the fourth beta of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html"><ins>Android 12</ins></a>, and while there aren&#39;t any major new features here, it marks an important step in the operating system&#39;s development.

Here&#39;s everything the company showed off during its August 11th livestream.&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><h2>Galaxy Z Fold 3</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2c05d20-fa4d-11eb-b6ae-611906031355" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 with the camera app open in Flex mode" data-uuid="254b5367-06bc-30d7-8d35-2014c9c9ee95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html">Galaxy Fold 3</a> headlined Samsung’s latest Unpacked event. One of the more noteworthy features of the foldable is that it includes an under-display camera. When it’s not in use, the Fold 3’s internal selfie shooter will attempt to blend in with the screen. While you can still see the component, particularly if your eyes drift to that part of the display, it helps make the device feel like more of a traditional tablet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And speaking of tablets, you can use Samsung&#39;s S Pen stylus with the Galaxy Fold 3. The company devoted an entire segment of its Unpacked event to detailing the time and effort it invested to make the two compatible with one another. In short, the $50 S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Pro feature rounder tips that can automatically retract if you apply too much pressure to the Fold 3’s internal display. Samsung also made the screen protector 80 percent stronger.</p><p>Once you get past those upgrades, a more capable Cover Display and the addition of IPX8-rated waterproofing, the one thing that stands out the most about the Fold 3 is that Samsung plans to sell it for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:more palatable $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">more palatable $1,800</a>.

A lot of that has to do with the fact Samsung plans to sell its latest clamshell foldable for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,000" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">$1,000</a> when it comes out on August 27th. That’s a $200 price cut from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-price-cut-180002076.html">$1,200</a> Samsung started selling the Galaxy Z Flip 5G at the start of 2021 and puts it more inline with other high-end phones.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically, Samsung also outfitted the Flip 3 with a more usable Cover Display that is four times larger than the one found on its predecessor. That means there’s more room for notifications and widgets, and you can do things like access Android’s quick settings menu and Samsung Pay without opening the device.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5912f9a0-fac1-11eb-a7e3-be3eb8f06587" alt="Galaxy Watch 4" data-uuid="c6a869cf-4f3e-30a5-ad5c-d8fb5744e786"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Once you get past the mouthful that is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS powered by Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4 </a>looks like it has a lot going for it. In our hands-on, we found the Galaxy Watch 4’s software had more in common with Tizen than Wear OS. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. All of the usual flourishes that made the company’s previous wearables compelling were still there, with the added advantage of better third-party app support.</p><p>In terms of hardware, Samsung added a 3-in-1 BioActive sensor that can measure your body fat percentage, a new 5nm processor and 50 percent more RAM. Those latter additions should make the Galaxy Watch 4 feel faster. What’s more, the more expensive Watch 4 Classic features the return of the company’s much-loved rotating bezel. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic" href="https://fave.co/3Az958F">Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</a> will start at $249 and $349 when they hit store shelves on August 27th.</p><h2>Galaxy Buds 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b076cd20-fac1-11eb-bf75-b2305380f4a9" alt="Galaxy Buds 2" data-uuid="47c19e1e-34dc-3ffb-b919-8dcd1c7abd99"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Before closing out the event, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 2.

According to the board, Facebook mistakenly removed the post for violating its hate speech policy under the belief it targeted Chinese people.</p><p>&quot;This case highlights the importance of considering context when enforcing hate speech policies, as well as the importance of protecting political speech,&quot; the Oversight Board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/342799874210662-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2021-007-fb-ua/"><ins>wrote</ins></a>. &quot;This is particularly relevant in Myanmar given the February 2021 coup and Facebook’s key role as a communications medium in the country.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The user, who appeared to be in Myanmar, posted the message in question in April. The post argued that, rather than providing funding to Myanmar&#39;s military following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-myawaddy-tv-station-171950609.html">the coup in February</a>, tax revenue should be given to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hlutaw, a group of legislators that opposed the coup. The post, which was written in Burmese, was viewed around half a million times.</p><p>Although no users reported the post, Facebook decided to take it down. The post used profanity while referencing Chinese policy in Hong Kong. Facebook&#39;s translation of the post led four content reviewers to believe that the user was criticizing Chinese people.&nbsp;</p><p>Under its hate speech rules, Facebook doesn&#39;t allow content that targets someone or a group of people based on ethnicity, race or national origins that use “profane terms or phrases with the intent to insult.” The user who wrote the post claimed in their appeal that they shared it in an effort to “stop the brutal military regime.”</p><p>The Oversight Board says context is particularly important in this case. The Burmese language uses the same word to refer to both a state and people who are from that state. Other factors made it clear the user was referring to the Chinese state, according to the board.</p><p>Two translators who reviewed the post &quot;did not indicate any doubt&quot; that the word at the heart of the case was referring to a state. The translators told the board the post includes terms that Myanmar’s government and the Chinese embassy commonly use to refer to each other. <a href="https://scontent.fymq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/m1/v/t0.41931-6/An-GdNo_tzvg5Mp6a8Jw9Ixx5mSBMa7G7sJBqaI4Vm-DV8D-OIZ9g3SqvtWB77eqZ2eVRTeny9K0bWEk9b63Sp5qJbgliRiKFXKZ5b93tGSiUPghLnGfowrHCwxiMwwxwgK9CnP5Taa1KtDzf1OdDRzZCA?ccb=10-5&amp;oh=def8e2cf3624fd9bcaf2fc279871b77d&amp;oe=61188B4D&amp;_nc_sid=340960"><ins>Public comments</ins></a> the board received regarding the case indicated the post was political speech.</p><p>The Oversight Board ordered Facebook to restore the post and recommended Facebook ensures &quot;its Internal Implementation Standards are available in the language in which content moderators review content.
