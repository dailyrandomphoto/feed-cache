The initial notice didn&#39;t explain how the <em>Fortnite</em> developer was challenging the decision, but there were a number of areas that left the company unhappy.</p><p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers&#39; ruling determined Epic had to pay $3.65 million in damages for violating Apple&#39;s rules barring third-party in-app payment systems, plus 30 percent of whatever Epic earned through its in-house payment system from November 2020 onward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More importantly, Rogers found Epic&#39;s monopoly allegations didn&#39;t hold up under scrutiny. While Epic did succeed in forcing Apple to allow links to third-party purchasing systems, it didn&#39;t receive concessions on allowing third-party app stores or obtaining &quot;fair competition&quot; for in-app purchasing. Apple largely gets to preserve its existing business model, preventing access to the Epic Games Store or similar App Store alternatives.</p><p>Apple isn&#39;t completely satisfied, either, and is expected to appeal Epic&#39;s one win in the case.

Disney didn&#39;t say when you might expect on-demand versions of these titles, whether on Disney+ or rival services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is partly a reaction to the relatively strong theater-only releases of summer extravaganzas like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>. While COVID-19 still hurt box office numbers (<em>Shang-Chi</em>&#39;s $75.5 million US opening paled in comparison to multiple Disney 2019 releases), the revenue may have been enough to justify returning to pre-pandemic distribution.</p><p>There&#39;s also the matter of placating key factions. Disney said it has a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html">pay talent fairly</a> for hybrid theater-and-digital relases, but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Scarlett Johansson&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html"><em>Black Widow</em> lawsuit</a> plays a role in considering Disney+ launches. The company might not want to risk further trouble with actors and others whose income depends on theatrical performance. And then there&#39;s the theaters themselves. When chains like AMC vowed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trolls-word-tour-pvod-amc-062745004.html">pull Universal movies</a> even when many locations were closed, Disney might not be willing to provoke a similar confrontation as theaters resume business.</p><p>This and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">Warner Bros.&#39; 2022 return to theaters</a> supports the expectations of many cynics — that studios only saw day-one streaming access as a temporary necessity that would disappear the moment it was reasonably safe to watch on big screens. That&#39;s not completely shocking when the movie industry&#39;s business model still revolves around theaters, but any fundamental shifts in strategy might not happen for a long, long time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8719f9c-54f8-4def-8683-dd5f65889f40</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 16:13:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631376790</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T16:13:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and 'rose charts']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Crimean War, hospitals of the day weren&#39;t so much centers of healing or recovery as they were the places where injured combatants went to die slightly more slowly. Turkey&#39;s Scutari hospital was one such notorious example. Converted by the British Empire from army barracks, Scutari lacked every imaginable amenity, from basic sanitation to sufficient ventilation, this &quot;hospital&quot; served as a potent incubator for myriad infectious diseases — that is until Florence Nightingale and her team of volunteer nurses arrived in 1854.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>Maladies of Empire</em></a> by Jim Downs explores how many aspects of modern medicine are borne on the backs of humanity&#39;s most abhorrent impulses, though in the excerpt below, Downs illustrates how one woman&#39;s unyielding tenacity and fastidious record keeping helped launch the field of preventative medicine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3ea0be0-0fff-11ec-b5cb-197e93c2d343" alt="Maladies of Empire" data-uuid="3cd128b6-22ae-3b1b-aba7-030287f4a386"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Belknap Press</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from </em><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>MALADIES OF EMPIRE: HOW COLONIALISM, SLAVERY, AND WAR TRANSFORMED MEDICINE </em></a><em>by JIM DOWNS, published by The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

All rights reserved.</em></p><hr><p>While in Scutari, Nightingale developed a system of record keeping that tracked a variety of factors at the Barrack Hospital and the nearby General Hospital. She took notes on everything from cleanliness to the quantity of supplies to diet to the placement of latrines and graveyards.</p><p>She also carefully examined the physical space. She took careful note of the size of the wards, the condition of the roof, and the quality, size, and placement of the windows. In her book on the health of the British army, like Thomas Trotter and others who wrote about the importance of fresh air, she pointed to the problem of improper ventilation, and she devoted an entire section to “bad ventilation.” She quoted the report of the sanitary commission, which remarked on the “defective state of the ventilation” in the Barrack Hospital. There were only “a few small openings here and there,” so that there was no way for the “hot and foul” air to escape. As an adherent of the miasma theory, she believed that diseases were spread through the air and advocated for ventilation to release the “foul air” from hospitals.</p><p>In addition to inadequate ventilation, Nightingale pointed to poor drainage and badly designed sewers and plumbing. In her testimony to the royal commission, Nightingale reported on the filthy conditions she found in the Barrack Hospital when she arrived. “The state of the privies... for several months, more than an inch deep in filth, is too horrible to describe.” She observed six dead dogs under one of the windows, and a dead horse lay in the aqueduct for weeks. The drinking water was dirty; once she saw used hospital uniforms in the water tank. Rats and insects abounded, and “the walls and ceilings were saturated with organic matter.”</p><p>In the conclusion to her report on the health of the British Army, she explained, “We have much more information on the sanitary history of the Crimean campaign than we have upon any other, but because it is a complete exam (history does not afford its equal) of an army, after failing to the lowest ebb of disease and disaster from neglects committed, rising again to the highest state of health and efficiency from remedies applied.</p><p>&quot;It is the whole experiment on a colossal scale.” She pointed out that during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign, mortality exceeded that of the plague of 1665 as well as that of recent cholera epidemics. But during the last six months of the war, after sanitary reforms had been made, “we had... a mortality among our sick little more than that among our healthy Guards at home.”</p><p>Using mortality data that she had collected during the war, along with domestic mortality statistics, Nightingale showed that between 1839 and 1853, mortality among soldiers was much higher than among civilian men: “of 10,000 soldiers [at the age of 20], 7,077 live to the age of 39, out of whom 135 die in the next year of age; whereas out of 10,000 civilians at the age of 20, 8,253 attain the age of 39, and of those 106 die in the year of age following.” Nearly all mortality among soldiers was the result of disease; “actual losses in battle form a very small part of the calamities of a long war.” Nightingale classified the causes of death as “zymotic diseases” (which in the nineteenth century referred to infectious diseases such as fevers, measles, and cholera), “chest and tubercular diseases,” and “all other diseases (including violent deaths).” Nightingale was critical of the army’s classification system for diseases. At the bottom of a chart, she notes, “Bronchitis and influenza have no place in the Army nomenclature. The chronic catarrh of the Army Returns is believed to be really phthisis, in the great majority of cases; acute catarrh comprehends both epidemic catarrh, or influenza and bronchitis.”</p><p>Nightingale presented statistics using charts, tables, and diagrams, which were just beginning to appear in research reports, to make it easier for readers to visualize the comparison she was making. She developed a new kind of graphic, called a “rose chart,” also known as a coxcomb chart or polar area diagram, to present mortality data from the Crimean War. Each chart, which is laid out like a pie, shows data from one year, with the slices representing months. Each slice is divided into colored segments whose area is proportional to the number of deaths.</p><p>One segment is for deaths from wounds, a second for “preventable or mitigable zymotic diseases,” and a third for all other causes. A quick glance at the charts of deaths from April 1854 to March 1855 and April 1855 to March 1856 is enough to show that many more deaths were caused by disease than by combat, and that overall mortality decreased in the second year.</p><p>To further make visible the dangers of unsanitary hospitals, Nightingale gathered mortality data for matrons, nuns, and nurses working in fifteen London hospitals who died of the “zymotic diseases” of fever and cholera. She presented tables, which she notes William Farr compiled for her, showing that the mortality rate of the nursing staff was much higher than that of the female population in London; in addition, women working in hospitals were more likely to die of zymotic diseases than were other women. She used these figures to argue for the “very great importance” of hygiene in hospitals. “The loss of a well-trained nurse by preventible [sic] disease,” she wrote, “is a greater loss than is that of a good soldier from the same cause. Money cannot replace either, but a good nurse is more difficult to find than a good soldier.”</p><p>In her book Notes on Hospitals, she retold the story of the British prisoners of war who died in a crowded jail cell in India in 1756: “Shut up 150 people in a Black hole of Calcutta, and in twenty-four hours an infection is produced so intense that it will, in that time, have destroyed nearly the whole of the inmates.” Nightingale’s reference to the case is evidence for its status as the prototypical illustration of the need for ventilation. And the fact that it took place in India shows how British medical authorities used information from around the empire.</p><p>As a result of her work with large numbers of patients in the Crimean War, Nightingale framed her analysis like an epidemiologist, in terms of populations. She focused on how disease spread within a group. She devoted her energies not to changing bedpans or dressing wounds but to studying the structure of hospitals, analyzing statistics, and figuring out how to increase ventilation.</p><p>The war provided her the opportunity to compare mortality rates in varied settings: crowded hospitals, shabby tents, and wooden huts. It also underscored to her the importance of preventive measures, which constitutes one of the major tenets of modern epidemiology. By publishing her observations, her insights, and guidelines for hospitals to follow, she hoped to provide a set of rules and guidelines for physicians to follow to prevent the spread of disease. While efforts to ensure proper hygiene as a way to guard against illness can be traced to Mesopotamian civilization and Sanskrit writings from 2000 BCE, Nightingale’s warnings, in particular, and sanitary reform, more generally, sparked a critical turning point in the middle of the nineteenth century that gave rise to preventive medicine. This transformed military medicine from an enterprise that largely focused on treatment and surgery to one that began to engage epidemiological questions and issues.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-maladies-of-empire-jim-downs-belknap-press-153044507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f1d7fff-3b7f-4dcc-9236-865cca0a76b7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 15:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631045430</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T20:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and &#39;rose charts&#39;]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla rolls out Full Self Driving 10 beta with more confident decision making]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html">last big Full Self Driving beta</a> was about enabling more semi-autonomous features off the highway, its newest release is focused more on helping you trust those features. <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/11/tesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet/">notes</a> Tesla has started rolling out a Full Self Driving 10 beta that, from early <a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1436624804107354117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436624804107354117%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2021%2F09%2F11%2Ftesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet%2F">reports</a>, appears to make smarter and more confident decisions off the highway.

In a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803">Apple Support post</a> first seen by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the tech giant has warned that high amplitude vibrations, &quot;specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines&quot; transmitted through handlebars, can damage its phones&#39; cameras. As the publication notes, that damage can be permanent. A simple Google search will surface <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/594197/Will+shaking+damage+the+image+stabilization">posts</a> over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/76ezfz/psa_motorcycle_vibration_can_damage_cell_phone/">past</a> few years by users whose cameras were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/ht0sv3/psa_iphone_11_camera_destroyed_via_motorcycle/">ruined</a> after they mounted their iPhone on their bike, mostly so they can use it for navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple didn&#39;t say why it&#39;s issuing a warning now, it did explain the reason why attaching the iPhone to a motorcycle can destroy its camera. The company said that the camera&#39;s optical image stabilization (OIS) and closed-loop autofocus (AF) features can be damaged by long-term exposure to high-amplitude vibrations. A camera&#39;s OIS makes it possible for a device&#39;s gyroscope to sense movement. In turn, the gyroscope changes its angle and the lens moves accordingly to prevent blur when you accidentally move while taking a photo.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile with closed-loop AF, a phone&#39;s onboard magnetic sensors measure vibrations to compensate for the movement, so the lens can be positioned accurately. As <em>MacRumor</em> notes, all models since the iPhone 7 come with both features.</p><p>Thus, Apple says it&#39;s not recommended to attach iPhones to motorcycles with high-power or high-volume engines. For mopeds and scooters, you may want to buy a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk of damage — or simply just use another GPS device to make sure you don&#39;t ruin a device that costs hundreds to over a thousand dollars.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-motorcycle-vibrations-iphone-camera-warning-083801715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b467970a-d6a6-48a1-848b-1d6eadbb4c0d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 08:38:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631349537</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T08:38:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27e7c470-12d4-11ec-9b1f-ef481070a5ea" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27e7c470-12d4-11ec-9b1f-ef481070a5ea" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[humanmade via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Caucasian male biker sitting on his motorbike and using his smart phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Handsome Caucasian male biker mounting his motorbike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook has been giving misinformation researchers incomplete data]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Misinformation researchers who&#39;ve been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">relying on the data</a> Facebook provides them may have lost months or even years of work. That&#39;s because the social network has been giving them flawed and incomplete information on how users interact with posts and links on the website, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has been giving academics access to its data over the past couple of years to track the spread of misinformation on its platform. It promised researchers transparency and access to <em>all</em> user interaction, but the data the company has been giving them reportedly only includes interactions for about half of its users in the US. Further, most of the users whose interactions were included in the reports are the ones who engage with political posts enough to make their leanings clear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In an email to researchers<em> The Times</em> saw, Facebook apologized for the &quot;inconvenience [it] may have caused.&quot; The company also told them that it&#39;s fixing the issue, but that it could take weeks due to the sheer volume of data it has to process. Facebook told the researchers, though, that the data they received for users outside the US isn&#39;t inaccurate.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones blamed the data inaccuracy to a &quot;technical error,&quot; which the company is apparently &quot;working swiftly to resolve.&quot; As <em>The Times</em> notes, it was University of Urbino associate professor Fabio Giglietto who first discovered the inaccuracy. Giglietto compared the data handed over to researchers with the &quot;Widely Viewed Content Report&quot; the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">published</a> publicly in August and found that the results didn&#39;t match.&nbsp;</p><p>Other researchers raised concerns after that report was published. Alice Marwick, a researcher from the University of North Carolina, told <em>Engadget</em> that they couldn&#39;t verify those results, because they had no access to the data Facebook used. The company reportedly held a call with researchers on Friday to apologize. Megan Squire, one of those researchers, told<em> The Times</em>: &quot;From a human point of view, there were 47 people on that call today and every single one of those projects is at risk, and some are completely destroyed.&quot;</p><p>Some researchers have been using their own tools to gather information for their research, but in at least one instance, Facebook cut off their access. In August, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html">disabled</a> the accounts associated with the NYU Ad Observatory project. The team used a browser extension to collect information on political ads, but the social network said it was &quot;unauthorized scraping.&quot; At the time, Laura Edelson, the project&#39;s lead researcher, told <em>Engadget</em> that Facebook is silencing the team because its &quot;work often calls attention to problems on its platform.&quot; Edelson added: &quot;If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-researchers-incomplete-data-050143486.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab041706-e7c4-4c48-836a-755b2be42eaf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 05:01:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631336557</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T05:02:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 23: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

In just under an hour, the studio showed off more than a dozen upcoming, highly anticipated games heading to the PS4 and PS5, complete with some major surprises and plenty of trailers.</p><p>The show started with a bang — the reveal of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-announcement-202114129.html"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em></a>, a remake of the classic BioWare RPG being built exclusively for the PS5. This is a big deal, considering the original never came to PlayStation platforms. From there, Sony highlighted a handful of release windows and extended trailers for games including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-ps5-release-date-203009394.html"><em>Tiny Tina&#39;s Wonderlands</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-remaster-4k-ps5-trailer-071047656.html"><em>Alan Wake remaster</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-ps5-pc-release-date-202824129.html"><em>Forspoken</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-v-sony-playstation-5-march-2022-204016288.html"><em>GTA V on PS5</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghostwire-tokyo-ps5-release-date-trailer-204746116.html"><em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-eve-gameplay-trailer-ps5-202800364.html"><em>Project Eve</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gran-turismo-7-ps5-release-date-205422758.html"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-first-footage-205908760.html"><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That wasn&#39;t even the end of it.

But it actually also released another sub-$100 product called <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-2##100-91400003-40">the Elite 2</a> — we just can&#39;t buy it here in the US. The company&#39;s product page says &quot;This product is not available in your country&quot; when accessed from America.</p><p>Our senior news editor Billy Steele noticed when he was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">reviewing the Elite 3</a> that there was a listing for what appeared to be an unannounced Elite 2 in Jabra&#39;s app. We&#39;ve since learned that the Elite 2 actually did get released, but only in countries like India, China, Russia and Turkey for now. According to the company, the Elite 2 indeed launched in &quot;select markets worldwide.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These buds are similar to the Elite 3, keeping the same overall shape and a similar design but with small differences. There&#39;s one fewer microphone per side for calls, no ambient sound mode or sidetone and the case only holds two charges instead of three. Otherwise, the Elite 2 is basically the same as the pair we reviewed, with 6mm speakers, EQ presets, Alexa support, one-touch Spotify playback and Google&#39;s Fast Pair for those using it with Android.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://tavesper.tech/2021/09/jabra-elite-2-malaysia/"><em>Tavesper.tech</em></a>, the Elite 2 is available in Malaysia for RM299, which is about $72. That&#39;s only about $8 cheaper than the Elite 3. Plus, prices could be different in other regions. On this <a href="https://www.macnificent.co.za/accessories/iphone-ipad-accessories/headphones/jabra-elite-2-true-wireless-in-ear-earbuds-dark-grey-detail">South African website</a>, for example, it&#39;s going for about 1,200 Rand, which is close to $85. For now, we can&#39;t directly compare prices without knowing what it could cost stateside, and just because it&#39;s not currently available in the US doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t ever come here eventually. You can find out more about the Elite 2 on its <a href="https://www.argos-support.co.uk/instruction-manual/7244096-jabra-elite-2-sport-true-wireless-in-ear-headphones-black.pdf">instruction manual published on European retailer Argos&#39; website</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-2-not-in-america-200543048.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc4ad2b5-114b-474e-b70c-c2e38676b6d2</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 20:14:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631303413</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T19:50:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff43d1e0-126e-11ec-b79b-0171e62e6c9c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff43d1e0-126e-11ec-b79b-0171e62e6c9c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Even after today’s ruling, don’t expect ‘Fortnite’ to return to the App Store anytime soon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After months of testimony and deliberation, we got an initial <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">decision</a> earlier today in the legal battle between Apple and Epic. As a <em>Fortnite</em> player, you may wonder what it all means in terms of playing the game on an iOS device. The short answer is not much.</p><p>The long answer is neither side came away from the contest with a decisive win. Judge Gonzales Rogers may have ruled in Epic’s favor when on the issue of allowing App Store developers to direct users to alternate payment systems, but on every other count, she sided with Apple. That includes the question of whether the company was right to terminate Epic’s App Store developer account when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html">added a direct payment option</a> in <em>Fortnite </em>last year<em>.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4c977141868c457a8abef93647ef55cc"><div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom:66.6667%;padding-top:120px;"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/preview-fortnite-ios-194604490.html"></a></div></div></div><p>On that matter, Judge Gonzales Rodgers said Apple’s decision was “valid, lawful and enforceable.” It’s therefore up to the company whether or not to allow the game back on the App Store. Based on the fact the tech giant rejected Epic’s request to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-fortnite-ios-korea-050658329.html"><ins>reinstate its developer license</ins></a> after South Korea <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-law-app-store-alternative-payments-114504007.html"><ins>passed a law</ins></a> that will require both Apple and Google to allow alternative payment systems on their app stores, and the fact Epic says it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"><ins>appeal the ruling</ins></a>, it’s unlikely the game will return to iOS anytime soon.</p><p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney made that much clear following the decision. “<em>Fortnite</em> will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370846545809410?s=20">said</a> on Twitter.</p><p>It’s hard to put a timeline on when we might see a new development in the situation. Court cases involving tech companies can take months and sometimes years to resolve.

The company was fresh face on the market, but it included luminaries of the electronic instrument world who worked on Akai&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-live-ii-review-153032772.html">MPC</a> line and Arturia&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-flagship-poly-brute-synthesize-is-shipping-now-233639466.html">&#39;Brute</a> line. So there was understandably some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rJd_j9_Ixs">hype</a>. And consensus is that it&#39;s <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/asm-hydrasynth">lived up to it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the company is taking its unique wavemorphing engine, a keybed with polyphonic aftertouch, plus its full raft of sound design tools and putting them in the portable, battery-powered and more affordable <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-explorer">Hydrasynth Explorer</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Explorer has 37 semi-weighted, mid-sized keys. So it&#39;s a bit more generous than your average mainstream synthesizer. And just like it&#39;s big siblings — the $1,299 Hydrasynth and $799 Hydrasynth Desktop — it has eight voices of polyphony and three oscillators. It also has two &quot;mutators&quot; which can mangle oscillators one and two in various ways from pretty standard (FM and pulse width modulation) to more out there (PhazDiff and harmonic sweep).</p><div id="ea5282f44bc64eb59ac11dc90d892ffb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoUj_IBd_OM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s also two filters that can be combined in series or parallel and five — yes <em>five</em> — LFOs and envelope generators. And those envelope generators aren&#39;t your standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelopes either. These are six-stage DAHDSR envelopes (delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release). There&#39;s also built-in delay and reverb effects, a 32-slot modulation matrix and a pretty advanced arpeggiator.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HxId3Yw4Y0">sound design power</a> comes in an instrument that can be powered by eight AA batteries and costs just $600. Granted at 7.5 pounds it&#39;s definitely pushing the boundaries of &quot;portable&quot;. You&#39;re definitely not going to lug the Hydrasynth Explorer on your commute,  but it&#39;s not too much of a hassle to drag it to an impromptu jam session or <a href="https://youtu.be/uCNYT0O54Zc">set up in a park</a> for an afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the Explorer, ASM also announced the <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-deluxe">Hydrasynth Deluxe</a> which has 73 full-sized keys and bumps the voice count up to 16. Of course, it also comes at a premium with a price of $1,799.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asm-hydrasynth-explorer-superbooth-wavemorphing-portable-191358134.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc3ebc36-66a1-427e-af5a-0b7b4f01b562</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 19:13:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631300873</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T19:07:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63672130-1266-11ec-afff-b14a7d0fc319" width="1225" height="645" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63672130-1266-11ec-afff-b14a7d0fc319" width="1225" height="645" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASM Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASM Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch sues two 'hate raiders' linked to automated harassment campaigns]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For much of the last month and a half, Twitch has fought a losing battle against a phenomenon called “hate raids.” These attacks see malicious individuals use an army of bots to spam a streamer’s chat with hateful language, and almost always they target creators from marginalized communities. This week, Twitch <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524416914/Twitch-Interactive-vs-Cruzzcontrol-and-CreatineOverdose">filed a suit</a> against some of those involved in the harassment campaigns.</p><p>The legal action comes after a variety of Twitch streamers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html">stepped away from the platform</a> on September 1st in protest of the company’s ineffective handling of the situation. The suit, first spotted by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitch-sues-users-over-alleged-hate-raids/"><em>Wired</em></a>, only names two defendants: CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose. Twitch does not identify the two individuals beyond their usernames but notes it believes they’re both based out of Europe.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the complaint, Twitch alleges CruzzControl is responsible for a network of approximately 3,000 bots that have been involved in hate raids against streamers in the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities. In addition to overwhelming those channels with racist, homophobic and sexist spam, the company says CruzzControl has shown how the bots work so that others can deploy them toward a similar end. Of CreatineOverdose, the company alleges it has directly linked them to several incidents, including one August 15th episode in which they claimed they were a member of the “K K K.”</p><p>“We hope this complaint will shed light on the identity of the individuals behind these attacks and the tools that they exploit, dissuade them from taking similar behaviors to other services, and help put an end to these vile attacks against members of our community,” a spokesperson for Twitch told <em>Wired</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666953/twitch-sues-alleged-hate-raiders-harassment-streamers"><em>The Verge</em></a> the lawsuit is only one part of the response it has planned to hate raids, with more platform-level action forthcoming. “Our teams have been working around the clock to update our proactive detection systems, address new behaviors as they emerge, and finalize new proactive, channel-level safety tools that we’ve been developing for months,” a Twitch spokesperson said.</p><p>While the legal action has yet to stop hate raids from occurring, some of those most affected by them say it’s a step in the right direction for the company. “I feel hopeful,” <a href="https://twitter.com/RekItRaven">Raven</a>, a streamer whose Twitch handle is RekItRaven, told <em>Wired</em>. “The people who are behind this need to be held accountable for their actions. They&#39;ve terrorized hundreds if not thousands of people. If this were to happen in a physical location we&#39;d expect the same. It shouldn&#39;t be any different online.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sues-hate-raiders-cruzzcontrol-and-creatine-overdose-184439305.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">083cacbf-8052-442a-9f52-57fc7a92e468</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:44:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631299275</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T18:41:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 11: In this photo illustration the logo of live streaming video platform Twitch is displayed on a smartphone on October 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

NYC officials made the limits permanent in August.</p><p>Currently, the delivery apps can charge restaurants up to 23 percent per order, which includes three percent to cover credit card processing fees. Otherwise, they could have charged fees of up to 35 percent. In April, DoorDash <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-commission-rate-flexibility-restaurants-food-delivery-161807416.html">introduced a tiered system</a> that charges up to 30 percent in commissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companies claim in their US District Court court <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839571/Delivery_Platforms_Complaint.pdf"><ins>complaint</ins></a>, which was posted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, that the cap is unconstitutional and tantamount to government overreach that will damage businesses. They&#39;re seeking an injunction to stop the city enforcing the fee limits as well as damages and a jury trial. “Left unchecked, the ordinance sets a dangerous precedent,” they argued.</p><p>Councilman Mark Gjonaj, chair of the city’s Small Business Committee, said that NYC would maintain the caps and proceed with other oversight over delivery apps. “The laws simply seek to bring fairness to a system that all too often lacks it,” he told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-doordash-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-over-fee-caps-11631237227"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. Engadget has contacted Uber Eats for comment.</p><p>“Grubhub has worked hard during the pandemic to support restaurants in New York City and across the country,&quot; a company spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Despite our best efforts, the City Council recently passed an unprecedented and unconstitutional price control targeting the food delivery industry. Price controls increase delivery fees for consumers, and therefore lead to a reduction of orders for both restaurants and couriers. While Grubhub remains willing to engage with the City Council, we unfortunately are left with no choice but to take legal action.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Grubhub also contends that the NYC ordinance will hurt not only the apps, but restaurants and consumers. It suggests the fee caps will will lead to higher prices and fewer deliveries for couriers, as well as less choice for services for restaurants from delivery platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;New York City Council passed harmful, unnecessary, and unconstitutional price controls which leave us no choice but to resolve this matter in court, as we did in San Francisco,&quot; a DoorDash spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;Not only do price controls violate the U.S. and New York Constitutions, but they will likely harm the very restaurants the City purports to support.&quot;</p><p>In June, San Francisco&#39;s Board of Supervisors <a href="https://www.nycfoodpolicy.org/food-policy-snapshot-san-francisco-delivery-app-commission-fee-cap/"><ins>voted</ins></a> to permanently cap delivery app fees at 15 percent, becoming the first city in the US to do so.
