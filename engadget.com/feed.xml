As usual, the small black buds take the same completely in canal (CIC) form factor which is what allows them to remain almost entirely out of sight. The &quot;new&quot; stuff is on the inside.</p><p>The flagship feature with the Eargo 6 is called &quot;Sound Adjust.&quot; No prizes for guessing what this does, but the company claims its proprietary algorithm can automatically sense your surroundings and the hearing aids will automatically optimize themselves to give you the best settings for it. Profiles are a fairly standard feature on most hearing aids, but automatic switching is usually something reserved for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/head-to-head-with-two-of-the-most-techenabled-hearing-aids-133039853.html">pricier models</a>, and they all do it with different levels of success, in my experience at least.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The difference here is that the Eargo 6 is much smaller than most of the other products that offer similar technologies. Being tiny is great, and the main selling point here, but it also means there&#39;s much less real estate to fill with sensors and chips. Regardless, Eargo seems to be figuring out clever ways to bring their offerings up to feature parity with their (physically and metaphorically) larger competition.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be CES 2022 without a few COVID-related influences. For the last two years, those with hearing loss have faced a new challenge: Conversing with people who are wearing a mask. Not only does this remove any visual feedback, it also muffles sound — a double blow for those struggling to understand you. As such, the company has introduced a &quot;mask mode&quot; that aims to resolve some of the changes in sound that face coverings create.</p><p>Other tweaks this time around include revised noise reduction with the company claims further reduces background noise allowing the voice to punch through. The Eargo 6 is also rated IPX7 for water resistance. This means they can be submerged for 30 minutes at a depth of one meter without water damage. In practical terms, this means you can probably leave them in while you shower or go for a quick swim. Or, more logically, you can get them a bit when while cleaning them.</p><p>As we&#39;re not physically at CES this year, we haven&#39;t been able to test them like we normally do, but if previous years are anything to go by the plucky little hearing aid is only getting smarter and more useful. As usual, the Eargo 6 is being sold direct to consumers and will retail for $2,950. In hearing aid terms that&#39;s about the going rate for higher-end models, though the company does offer financing options too.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eargo-6-hearing-aid-030036492.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df3f6e1b-c6da-4b05-8a4c-ded3cc4d8a6d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 03:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641330707</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T21:11:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/939be600-6da2-11ec-b387-50897fb43959" width="7051" height="5185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/939be600-6da2-11ec-b387-50897fb43959" width="7051" height="5185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eargo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eargo 6 hearing aid.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eargo 6 hearing aid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro bone-conduction headphones bump up the bass]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">avid user</a> of bone-conduction headphones for years and can attest to the lackluster low-end in this form factor. Luckily, things are improving. Along with recently changing its name to Shokz (formerly Aftershokz), the company has delivered on this long-desired feature upgrade to its line of bone-conduction headphones. The new product is called <a href="https://shokz.com/">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) and there is a significant boost in bass with this Bluetooth 5.1 headset. In addition, Shokz is renaming its existing product line to tie things together with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">Aeropex</a> becoming OpenRun and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-aftershokz-xtrainerz-optishokz-revvez-bone-conduction-sunglasses.html">Xtrainerz</a> now called OpenSwim.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1cf4e2dd-7362-4a61-a99b-5930e66a9645"/><p>For those new to bone-conduction headphones, let me clarify a few things. These still don’t <em>quite</em> measure up to over-ear or in-ear models, since they have an open-ear design. The transducers rest against your cheeks in <em>front</em> of your ears and deliver sound to your inner ear via the bone. It’s a different delivery system for sound that leaves your ears open to the world, which can be a double-edged sword. They’re not great on the subway or in generally noisy environments. Don’t be disheartened, though, as this same design lets you walk, run or bike around and listen to music while still being able to hear the world around you. And with the upgrades we&#39;re seeing, the audio experience is better than ever.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, diminished low-end has long been a problem for this form factor. The OpenRun (Aeropex) have good volume levels and a decent frequency response compared to previous models. But now that I’ve tested the OpenRun pro, there’s been a noticeable improvement in the low-end spectrum. I don’t mean that they’re so loud they’re literally bouncing off your cheeks (like the old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-18-aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html">Titanium model</a> did). These deliver a good sub-frequency to give your tunes more depth without excessive tactile reverberation. My standard listening is techno and electronic music (<a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/jon-turi/jonturi-2021-series-02/">like this</a>) and it holds up pretty well. The decibel and frequency response specs are the same as before, but acoustic tweaks have born fruit. For bone conduction headphones, the OpenRun Pro sounds great.</p><p>Other desirable enhancements in this new model include the fit and charging capability. The over-the-ear curve is more rounded and the side enclosures are 20-percent smaller than before. This makes them feel light and comfortable. The battery life has been bumped up from 8 to 10 hours of listening and you can charge fully in one hour (a whole hour less than before). On top of that, we’re told you can get 1.5 hours worth of listening in five minutes of charging. A great feature when you’re settling in for a workout and hear the headset exclaim “charge me”.</p><p>If you’ve just gotten Aeropex headphones over the holidays, don’t fret. I’ve been using these for a long while and have enjoyed the experience. I even feel that while there’s not as much bass, these could be a <em>touch</em> louder in the mid to high range than the new model.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the OpenRun Pro has traded complete waterproofing for better sound. A fine mesh grate covers two vents in front of and below the cheek-based delivery system, changing it to IP55 water-resistant (still more than adequate). The OpenRun (Aeropex) retains its IP67 rating due to its sealed enclosure. If you want to wear these in the shower, then you’re in a good place (but maybe consider OpenSwim if this is a habit).</p><p>As of today, the <a href="https://shokz.com/">entire line</a> is available for purchase including the new <a href="https://shokz.com/">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) with a few new colors (although only black may be available at launch). The fully-waterproof <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openswim">OpenSwim</a> is still $149.95, while the <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openrun">OpenRun</a> ($129.95) will continue to be available at its recently lowered price.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5b2c390-6cae-11ec-beff-9f0bfc47d140" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro color options" data-uuid="de95a169-5cc7-3c70-9ad9-1a08725a8207"><figcaption>The new OpenRun Pro color options.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shokz</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aftershokz-shokz-openrun-pro-bone-conduction-headphones-bass-030031419.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5bd8ecf-5ddf-4a63-a244-1494aafa9179</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 03:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641307223</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T14:40:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88b41cd0-6cad-11ec-b78d-557e548be86b" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6278590-6cad-11ec-8f9b-1b95156bda89" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones in grey shown close-up on a wooden table top.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wemo's Smart Video Doorbell is exclusive to the Apple ecosystem]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s no shortage of app-connected, camera-enabled doorbells on the market, and now there&#39;s one more, this time from IoT company Wemo, a subsidiary of Belkin International.

The new headset will be compatible with the PS5 and with the new VR2 Sense controllers. It has a display resolution of 2000 x 2040 pixel per eye, has a 110-degree field of view, is capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates and supports 4K HDR.</p><p>The PS VR2 features inside-out tracking, which means it has multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. Sony has also introduced a new sensory feature for the device called &quot;headset feedback&quot; that can make games and experiences even more immersive. Headset feedback uses a built-in motor with vibrations to simulate in-game events — it can, for instance, mimic the feel of a character&#39;s elevated pulse rate while they&#39;re hiding from a threat or the feel of objects passing close to a character&#39;s head.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>3D audio and eye tracking are a couple of other features that create immersion. The headset can detect the motion of your eyes, allowing you to interact with the game environment like you&#39;d interact with the real world. As for the PS VR2 Sense controllers, they&#39;ll have key features from the DualSense controllers, particularly haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. While Sony has yet to reveal the headset&#39;s availability, the company announced one of the first games arriving on the platform. <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain, </em>a VR experience in the Horizon universe, is apparently being built for the PS VR2 and will be an exclusive title for the platform.</p><div id="ecb98f40768347fb96332f0a082201fe"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPNn-jwAC9c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4b5c898-f664-4387-8787-f19506432534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 02:31:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641349876</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T02:31:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's portable Freestyle projector focuses and levels automatically]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung&#39;s</a> making more moves in the portable projector market with its new Freestyle model.

With the Aonic 40, the company offers a similar design to its premium model, maintaining adjustable active noise cancellation (ANC) and on-board controls with slightly more battery life than the 2020 version.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the Aonic 40 will debut at $150 less than its elder sibling did two years ago, the new model doesn&#39;t look any less premium. Shure opted for a combination of aluminum and nylon, revising the silver and black or sliver and white/tan color schemes from the Aonic 50. The earcups on the 40 rotate flat and fold inward for easy storage, making them a decent option for travel.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22a86d20-6d74-11ec-bfdf-7b4acf66d34b" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Shure Aonic 40" data-uuid="b3515ce7-524b-3b25-8a90-7f70b19d553d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shure</div></figure><p>Shure says you can expect its &quot;iconic sound&quot; alongside a fully customizable EQ via its ShurePlus Play app on Android and iOS. That software will allow you to save any created settings for future access. The app also allows you to choose between three ANC options as well as tweak the Environment Mode (ambient sound). Shure also says the software is equipped with a hi-res music player that works with the Aonic 40.&nbsp;</p><p>As is typically the case with headphones these days, Shure is hyping call quality thanks to dual beamforming microphones. On-board controls will allow you to easily answer those, in addition to volume adjustments and accessing both the ANC and ambient sound options. The company says you&#39;ll get up to 25 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation turned on — up from 20 hours on the Aonic 50. Plus, a quick charge option can offer five hours of use in 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Aonic 40 is available now in black and white color options for $249.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/shure-aonic-40-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability-020042770.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">876638b2-4814-4389-bf6b-f05331a0c03c</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 02:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311020</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:43:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5f76b570-6d71-11ec-a938-f412d5d2987d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5f76b570-6d71-11ec-a938-f412d5d2987d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shure]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shure Aonic 40]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shure Aonic 40]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus 10 Pro is the first new phone of 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First out of the gates in 2022, OnePlus has a new flagship for anyone <em>already</em> looking for a smartphone refresh.

They include a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED with LTPO screen, which means the phone can adjust its refresh rates to improve battery life. There are no specifics on screen size, but the rumors suggest it’ll be a pretty large 6.7-inch display. OnePlus will include 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging in its new flagship, which should be suitably speedy when the 5,000mAh battery needs charging.<br><br>The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, running Android 12 with OnePlus’ OxygenOS tricks and aesthetics. When it comes to cameras, expect 48- and 50-megapixel sensors with an additional 8MP sensor too. Optical zoom? Ultrawide? We don’t know just yet, but the camera array will include dual optical image stabilization, which should help with crisper images, less noise and better performance in low light. That said, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera performance was one of the weaker points on an otherwise impressive smartphone. <br><br>Hopefully, the 10 Pro can right that wrong.The big challenge could be balancing price, specs and features so that it offers enough go up against the high-end phones of Apple and Samsung.

It&#39;s dual <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-motor/Synchronous-motors">synchronous motors</a> are current-energized, meaning that their rotational speed is based on the amount of electrical energy applied — rather than relying on permanent magnets to generate the magnetic field turns the wheels.

A full charge (0-100 percent capacity) on an 11W AC plug will take around 10.5 hours to complete (or a whopping 33 hours at 3.7 kW). Charging up to 80 percent on a DC fast charger will take 97 minutes at 50 kW, 40 minutes at 120 kW or just 35 minutes if you&#39;re lucky enough to find a charging station outfitted with it a 250kW port (note that the M60&#39;s 369V architecture limits its DC charging rate to 195 kW even if you do get lucky with an ultrafast station).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/818b4090-6d9e-11ec-9f6f-5d5402e2ab1f" alt="iX M60 brake caliper" data-uuid="787ec129-9d9f-3291-9b95-1de61d056417"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>Outwardly, the M60 is quite similar to the iX. It measures 195 x 77 x 65 inches and incorporates an aluminum space frame and carbon cage with carbon fiber reinforced plastic in the roof, side and rear. But if you look closer, you&#39;ll notice M60-exclusive blue brake calipers and optional 22-inch rims. Of the eight available exterior colors, Titanium Bronze is only available on the M60, as are the optional Titanium Bronze wheels.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cc296cd0-6d9e-11ec-aecf-e6fb2d318342" alt="iX M60 interior" data-uuid="201a74a4-3b22-3489-941f-851167a52208"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>On the interior, M60 drivers will have their pick of five seat color options (either using SensaTec material or perforated leather) as well as the regular set of features, gadgets and ADAS systems we&#39;ve come to expect on luxury vehicles. That includes a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond surround sound system, a panoramic &quot;Sky Lounge&quot; LED roof, adaptive LED headlights and myriad driver and traffic monitoring sensors, and something called BMW Natural Interaction, which allows you to control the infotainment system with verbal commands and hand gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>Pricing for the M60 will start at $106,095 when the orders begin this June.

Among the models the company is updating are its popular Stealth GS77 and Stealth <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-180001632.html">GS66 laptops</a>. New to the 2022 versions of the laptop is a more durable zinc alloy hinge. They also feature larger trackpads and keycaps for a more comfortable typing experience. Between the Stealth GS77 and Stealth GS66, MSI will offer 10 different configurations.</p><p>With the latter, the most affordable model will cost $1,799 and feature an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of NVMe storage. It also comes with a 17-inch 360Hz Full HD display. If you want MSI’s most powerful GS77 model, you’ll need to set aside $4,199. That gets you a computer with a 14-core, 20-thread i9-12900H; NVIDIA’s new flagship laptop GPU, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html"><ins>RTX 3080 Ti</ins></a>; 32GB of RAM; and a 1TB M.2 drive.

The Core i9 Stealth GS77 will come with a metal pad that melts when the computer reaches a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit. The liquid fills the space between the CPU and thermal block, leading to a more efficient transfer of heat, according to MSI.

The base model comes with an RTX 3070 Ti, i7 12700H processor and 32GB of RAM for $3,249.

Back then, it said that its technology — which combine land-based sensors and GPS — was accurate to around 2.5 cm, or 0.9 inches. This new model has six pairs of stereo cameras around the vehicle to help with object detection, which is then processed by a local neural network. This, combined with the aforementioned GPS technology, enables it to maintain its position within a geofence around an individual field.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e68ebe10-6d92-11ec-bfc9-8d25f75f9894" alt="Image of the sensor bay on top of John Deere&#39;s autonomous tractor" data-uuid="b83433f0-91b5-36d4-8920-512ca81ee349"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Deere</div></figure><p>The model that Deere is showing off combines a Deere 8R Tractor, a TruSet-enabled chisel plow and the secret sauce contained within its navigation technology. It says that all a farmer needs to do is drive it to the start of a field, configure it for autonomous operation and then “swipe from left to right to start the machine.” Its progress can then be monitored from a mobile device, which can receive live video, data and metrics, allowing a farmer to adjust speed and drill depth from their phone.</p><p>We don&#39;t yet know how much the hardware is going to cost, but we can imagine that there will be plenty of interest from major farming companies both in the US and abroad as they look to cut costs on labor and search for efficiencies any way that they can.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/john-deere-autonomous-tractor-203054726.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8296e139-092a-4582-83c9-37941b370f1f</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:30:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641333399</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T21:56:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c8b87f70-6d92-11ec-a9fb-6af0c229cf19" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c8b87f70-6d92-11ec-a9fb-6af0c229cf19" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[John Deere]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of John Deere's Autonomous Tractor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[John Deere Autonomous Tractor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft and Qualcomm are building custom chips for AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Qualcomm&#39;s involvement with Microsoft is extending past <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-8cx-gen-3-7c-gen-3-arm-chipsets-windows-gaming-handheld-230008247.html">chips for PCs</a>.

To my knowledge Kojima has never claimed the film was an influence on his game (which also revolves around a replaceable, emotionless protagonist essentially working as an Amazon Flex courier) but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the case.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-pc-release-date-200229086.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c6b4851b-162c-420c-bf9f-a4ff4a0a9719</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:02:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326553</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T20:02:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/011cc4a0-6d95-11ec-8ffb-00839e62e319" width="2000" height="1223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/011cc4a0-6d95-11ec-8ffb-00839e62e319" width="2000" height="1223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kojima Productions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Death Stranding Director's Cut art]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Death Stranding box art]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' ROG Flow Z13 is a gaming tablet with NVIDIA's RTX 3050 Ti]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After delivering an ambitious gaming convertible notebook last year, the svelte <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-flow-x13-egpu-184023262.html">ROG Flow X13</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS" href="https://fave.co/3EWmut4">ASUS</a> is taking that concept even further with the Flow Z13 tablet. Think of it like a souped-up Surface Pro: the Z13 packs in Intel&#39;s new 12th-gen processors and up to NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti all in a sleek slate. Weighing in at 2.43 pounds, it&#39;s clearly not meant to replace smaller tablets like the iPad. Instead, ASUS sees it as a way to bring your PC games everywhere — say a cramped airplane tray table — without the bulk of a laptop.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1cbbee32-bcf2-4579-9646-6424392f7f52"/><p>Like the ROG Flow X13, the Z13 can connect to the ASUS XG Mobile external GPU, which supports up to AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 6850M in addition to NVIDIA&#39;s mobile RTX 30-series lineup. That eGPU still relies on a custom PCIe connection, which can reach up to 63 Gbps of graphics bandwidth, making it more capable than Thunderbolt 4&#39;s 40 Gbps. I was wary of the XG Mobile last year, given just how expensive and flaky similar eGPUs have been. And that was before we learned it would cost $1,500 with the 3080, and that it <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-xg-mobile">wasn&#39;t nearly as fast as reviewers would have liked</a>. At the very least, the Z13 promises to be a better performer than the X13 with its built-in hardware, so maybe an eGPU would be unnecessary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In person, the Z13 is exactly what you&#39;d expect from an ROG gaming laptop to look like. The preview unit ASUS sent for me to borrow felt dense and sturdy, surprisingly so for its 12 millimeter thickness. Unlike iPads and other tablets, it feels strong enough to survive a backpack commute without a protective case. From the front, you could easily mistake it for a notebook. From the sides and back though, it&#39;s more like a Super Surface, with a flexible kickstand and keyboard cover.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-bfdf-5bdcc1ffcee2" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13" data-uuid="21df3f12-a124-3d12-9bd9-639827bf1196"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I wasn&#39;t able to run any games and benchmarks on the ROG Z13, unfortunately. (I&#39;d wager ASUS&#39;s software and drivers aren&#39;t ready for serious testing yet.) But I could see why it could be compelling: An RTX 3050 Ti in a machine this size would be a dream for travel (at least, when that&#39;s safe again). And its 4K 13-inch display was perfectly fine for productivity tasks (there&#39;s also a 1080p 120Hz option). Given its size, though, the Z13 felt too heavy to use as a standard tablet. It&#39;s also not nearly as &quot;lappable&quot; as the Surface Pro devices; it&#39;s just too heavy to stay put while you&#39;re typing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a82-6c41-11ec-aa7f-cd1bdc13a6cc" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 keyboard" data-uuid="c1f4e5f1-5b26-3cc8-b0b5-09f303cfc6c8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>ASUS deserves credit for actually including the keyboard case with the Z13, something Microsoft still refuses to do with the Surface Pro. And the typing experience actually feels pretty decent, so long as the Z13 is planted firmly on a flat surface. I could see it being a solid option for casual gaming, but the WASD inputs don&#39;t feel nearly as responsive as a basic desktop gaming keyboard. Basically, if you&#39;re expecting to compete while using the Z13, plan to bring along a separate keyboard.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c9f9e1b7af754c33a58b8217c31ad57b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a81-6c41-11ec-bbdf-8d13a34be0a3" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 from the side"></section><p>You&#39;ll likely be able to connect most of your accessories to the Z13 as well, since it includes both a USB 2.0 Type-A connection, as well two USB 3.2 Type-C ports (one is hidden under the XG Mobile connection. There&#39;s also a microSD card slot, which is useful for throwing in additional storage or offloading media.</p><p>Without knowing the ROG Z13&#39;s price and testing it properly, it&#39;s hard to make any final judgements. Personally, I think most consumers would be better off investing in a gaming notebook, which would have bigger screens, faster hardware and more capable keyboards. But ASUS already makes plenty of those, including our beloved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">Zephyrus G14</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g-15-review-2021-gaming-laptop-150044817.html">G15</a>. The Z13, which is expected to land in the first half of 2022, is clearly meant for gamers who prioritize portability more than anything else. For them, this might be the tablet of their dreams.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-200004888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13b8ba1-22f3-44c4-b115-6281f1ef272d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326677</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T20:04:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop finally gets a webcam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS&#39; gaming laptops" href="https://fave.co/3EWmut4">ASUS&#39; gaming laptops</a> have caught up to the work-from-home era. The PC maker has unveiled its ROG laptop line for early 2022, and the centerpiece for many is likely an updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">Zephyrus G14</a> (shown above) that finally, finally includes a webcam — one with Windows Hello-friendly infrared, no less. ASUS told Engadget gamers didn&#39;t mind the absence of a camera in the past, but a combination of shrinking panels and smaller cameras made the inclusion possible. Whatever the reasoning, this will be welcome for anyone who had to forego the G14 (or buy an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-logitech-4k-pro-magnetic-webcam-for-pro-display-xdr.html">external webcam</a>) to participate in virtual classrooms and meetings.</p><p>There are plenty of performance-related upgrades, of course. The reworked Zephryus G14 uses AMD&#39;s new Ryzen 6000-series chips (up to the Ryzen 9 6900HS), a maximum 32GB of DDR5 memory and dedicated Radeon graphics up to the RX 6800S. Cooling has improved, too, thanks to a new vapor chamber, liquid metal on the CPU and GPU, a dust filter and higher-airflow fans. You&#39;ll also find slimmer overall display bezels, a 50 percent larger trackpad and a flashier mini-LED lid with 19 percent more lights and smoother animations. It&#39;s too soon to say if the G14 will match ASUS&#39; claims of 10-plus hours of video playback on battery, but USB-C fast charging and reduced GPU thermal design power (from 100W to 65W) should minimize the amount of time you need to plug in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t divulged pricing for the Zephyrus G14 as of this writing, but you&#39;ll have options for 144Hz 1080p and 120Hz 1440p screens, and you can spring for more frugal components like the Ryzen 5 6600HS or Radeon RX 6700S to keep costs down.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/249bf360-68cc-11ec-a6ea-ade70177c978" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 gaming laptop" data-uuid="ca240f0f-55bd-32f4-a239-8a59074d0366"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>There are other laptops in store. The new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review-150003509.html">Zephyrus Duo</a> 16 (pictured at middle) builds on the dual-screen concept with some unique display tricks. If you spring for the 120Hz 4K main panel, you can switch to 1080p at 240Hz thanks to a clustering technique — you can trade resolution for speed. You&#39;ll also find a tweaked second-screen mechanism that makes for a more &quot;seamless&quot; integration with the primary display. The G14&#39;s Ryzen 6000-series CPUs, liquid metal-enhanced cooling and the IR camera have made their way to the Duo, although you&#39;ll be using NVIDIA graphics (up to the new RTX 3080 Ti).</p><p>&nbsp;Other laptops aren&#39;t quite as eye-catching, but might still scratch the itch for gamers on the move. The ROG Flow Z13 (at bottom) is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">Surface Pro</a>-like 13.4-inch detachable for the gamer crowd with up to a 12th-gen Intel Core i9, a 4K screen and RTX 3050 Ti video, while the Strix G15 and G17 are more conventional 15- and 17-inch gaming portables that leap to the newest AMD processors and NVIDIA graphics. While pricing and availability are unknowns here as well, we&#39;d expect machines like the Duo and Flow to carry premiums given their still-rare form factors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a9084320-68d0-11ec-bbaf-1473f59638ce" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13" data-uuid="62a00696-1213-3138-9385-bab6ab4d67d7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-gaming-laptops-2022-200003687.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85bf823b-a1a2-45ba-ac66-3347f35d4654</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326642</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T20:04:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d5f45e0-68c4-11ec-bffa-61076437bc29" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d5f45e0-68c4-11ec-bffa-61076437bc29" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASUS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo says Qualcomm's car chipsets will make its infotainment system twice as fast]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/volvo/"><ins>Volvo</ins></a> will use Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms to beef up the infotainment systems in some of its upcoming models.

The company has unveiled a Snapdragon Ride Vision platform that combines a 4-nanometer system-on-chip with Arriver&#39;s computer vision software to give automakers an &quot;open, scalable and modular&quot; way to build Level 2 driver assists and Level 3 partial autonomy into their cars.</p><p>Snapdragon Ride Vision can help cars detect road geometry, pedestrians and other cars using 8MP wide-angle cameras. It can also handle driver monitoring (to keep your hands or eyes focused on driving) and perception for near-field parking cameras.

In all, unfolding and tensioning the sunshield involved 139 release mechanisms, 70 hinge assemblies, eight motors, about 400 pulleys and approximately a quarter-mile of cabling. If any one of those components failed, they could have set the entire project back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At best, it would have been another delay in a long line of setbacks. Following a redesign in 2005, NASA declared the JWST ready in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">2016</a>, but manufacturing complications delayed assembly to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">2019</a>. The coronavirus pandemic then led to further delays in shipping and testing the telescope. There’s still more work to be done before scientists can use Webb to study black holes and other celestial bodies. Over the next five and a half months, NASA has to deploy the telescope’s secondary mirror as well as align its optics. After all that, the world will get a chance to see the first images it takes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-sunshield-deployment-185747431.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43e82549-c526-4609-b89a-9f67d72a78d9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:57:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641344963</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T01:09:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92430760-6d8f-11ec-bfff-52a11b63659b" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92430760-6d8f-11ec-bfff-52a11b63659b" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[James Webb]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[James Webb]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Technics boasts 50-hour battery life in its new EAH-A800 ANC headphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Panasonic has trotted out all sorts of audio gear since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-03-technics-coming-back.html">reviving the iconic Technics brand</a> in 2014. Recently, that list includes a smattering of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-az70w-review-true-wireless-earbuds-130046061.html">true wireless earbuds</a> and <a href="https://www.technics.com/us/products/headphones/eah-f70n.html">headphones</a>, and at CES 2022, the company has yet another portable device ready to debut. With the EAH-A800, Technics has built a pair of hi-fi-ready wireless headphones with active noise cancellation (ANC) and claims of a whopping 50 hours of use on a charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear EAH-A800 packs in 40mm drivers that Technics says are the result of its experience building hi-fi audio gear. In addition to a new design and materials for that component, an Acoustic Control Chamber manages air flow to assist with driver performance and bass response. The company has also leveraged capacitor tech from its high-end amplifiers to limit distortion and maintain sound quality. The EAH-A800 supports LDAC for higher quality audio over Bluetooth, in addition to the typical AAC standard.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/816c9a00-6d67-11ec-bffe-1223779fe6fc" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Technics EAH-A800" data-uuid="6c6e12d1-f826-3672-b228-9f7ae1d42f94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Technics/Panasonic</div></figure><p>Technics promises &quot;industry-leading noise cancelling&quot; via a dual hybrid setup. An analog filter equipped feed back mic and a digital filter outfitted feed forward mic monitor unwanted clamor inside and out. The EAH-A800 also has Natural Ambient and Attention modes. The difference is that the latter makes it easier to hear voices while the former is a more universal transparency setting. Technics also provides multi-point pairing here, which will allow you to connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth and easily switch between them.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also making big promises when it comes to call clarity. Using a total of eight microphones, the EAH-A800 employs four to pick up your voice and four more to combat any environmental noise. Additionally, Technics says the feed forward mics are designed and positioned to reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most impressive claim on the EAH-A800 is the stated 50 hours of battery life. Technics says you can achieve this figure with ANC on listening to AAC audio. If you are listening via LDAC, the company says you can expect up to 40 hours of play time. Disable noise cancelling on either sound codec and listening time increases by 10 hours. So if you&#39;re willing to go without ANC or higher quality audio, you can get 60 hours of use out of these according to Technics. What&#39;s more, a 15-minute charge will give you 10 hours of use (ANC on, AAC quality streaming).&nbsp;</p><p>The EAH-A800 will be available in black and white color options in February for $350 (£299/€349).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-a800-noise-cancelling-headphones-announced-price-specs-184515539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27f70860-85ba-4629-9fd5-2c4eb08042ca</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:45:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311252</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:47:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Technics/Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen KS-series chips will reach 5.5GHz on a single core]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intel is seriously planning to crank things up with its 12th-generation KS-series desktop CPUs.

The 16-inch model, at least, will be Acer’s first with Intel’s attempt at toppling NVIDIA’s leadership position in the mobile graphics space. That comes with a handful of other quality-of-life improvements, including a 400-nit (up from 300 nits last year), 100 percent sRGB, 16:10 display. You can choose either a WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) or WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) resolution screen to cram inside, too.</p><p>Build-to-order options include a new 12th-generation Intel Core processor paired with the new Arc graphics. That will be paired with up to 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 2TB SSD storage, as well as WiFi 6e. In person, it’s a little lighter than its immediate predecessor although if you were walking past it in a hurry you’d barely know the difference. The webcam is now FHD, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I wasn’t able to take any benchmarks on the pre-release hardware I was able to see in the flesh, but Acer is feeling bullish about the performance here. It says that its new dual fan design, bigger air vents (and they are beefy) and bigger inlets on the keyboard should expel up to 10 percent more heat than previous versions. You’ll also be able to switch to silent running should the need arise, albeit at the cost of much of your performance.</p><p>Acer also made it clear that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-geforce-rtx-30-series-thin-and-light-134500570.html">existing Swift X</a>, which is currently shipping with the option of an RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, will remain on shelves for the foreseeable. That way, should you find Intel’s new silicon not to your taste, you can still get the upgrade you crave.</p><p>The 14-inch model, meanwhile, gets all of the other hardware bumps, including the better display options, the 12th generation Intel Chip, up to 16GB RAM and Windows 11. But graphics-wise, you’re left with the RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, which is probably enough for most users who aren’t yet ready to jump feet-first into Intel’s new ocean.</p><p>We don’t have US pricing or availability for the Swifts just yet, but in the UK we’re expecting them to arrive by the end of February or the start of March for around £1,000 (around $1,350).</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-16-intel-arc-graphics-181536080.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b19e1e5-53db-47fd-9813-5500c2fa3319</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322262</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:51:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Acer Swift X laptop on a wooden table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Swift X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer updates the Nitro 5 with AMD’s Ryzen 6000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often, the laptops that are announced at CES aren’t as exciting as the silicon that’ll be nestled inside them. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s Nitro 5" href="https://fave.co/3sTvdtX">Acer’s Nitro 5</a> is one such example, where less attention will be paid to the more refined design, since everyone will be talking about its new brains. Like the fact that it’ll be able to use both AMD’s Ryzen 6000 and Intel’s 12th-generation Core processors. That will be paired with anything up to NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB DDR4 3200 RAM and, depending on chip options, either a FHD 144Hz or QHD 165Hz panel.</p><p>Naturally, Acer has made a big effort to refine the chassis, despite it being a tiny bit thicker than its immediate predecessor. Rather than lots of chunky accents, the system goes for a more refined striped design, dialing down the more aggressive elements of its design. In addition, several ports are now sat on the back of the chassis since Acer knows that lots of people will use the Nitro 5 as a desktop replacement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sadly, I wasn’t able to do much beyond touch the new Nitro 5 and certainly there’s nothing too dramatic about the exterior changes. Acer was in no mood to allow me to run benchmarks, so all we can say for now is that we’re hopeful that it’ll do what AMD&#39;s other 6000 systems have been doing for a while.</p><p>In terms of when you can expect to be able to get your hands on one of these things, Acer says that the Intel edition will drop at some point in March, with the base model priced at $1,050. The AMD-toting version, meanwhile, will drop in April, with prices running from $1,099 up to whatever your budget and heart will allow.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-nitro-5-ryzen-6000-181528055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">329b250d-e1b4-45c7-8861-39ed93520db5</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322194</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:50:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Acer's Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
