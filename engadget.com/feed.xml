The automaker will reportedly begin the electric truck&#39;s production by the end of the first quarter of 2023 instead of this year. While Tesla has yet to formally announce the delay, the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck">Cybertruck&#39;s order page</a> removed a previous reference to production in 2022. The design section of the page previously read &quot;You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.&quot; Now, the sentence ends after the word &quot;nears.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Back in November, somebody on Twitter asked company chief Elon Musk for an update on the Cybertruck. Musk responded that Tesla has been grappling with a &quot;supply chain nightmare,&quot; and that he&#39;ll provide more updates during the company&#39;s next earnings call scheduled for January 26th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="51cd72a0a8834b0eb663f55a0d1a259d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh man, this year has been such a supply chain nightmare &amp; it’s not over!<br><br>I will provide an updated product roadmap on next earnings call.</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1465423422238994436?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>&#39; source, Tesla will have a limited production of the Cybertruck at first before increasing its output. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-tesla-unveils-its-cybertruck.html">unveiled</a> the Cybertruck in 2019 at a big event, wherein Musk said that production was slated to begin in late 2021. During the company&#39;s January 2021 earnings call, he said Tesla only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">expects</a> a few deliveries in 2021 and for volume production to start in 2022. Later that year, though, the company delayed the vehicle&#39;s release to 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Delays with Tesla releases don&#39;t come as a surprise anymore, seeing as Musk is known for announcing timetables that are a bit too optimistic. Supply chain and component shortages brought about by the pandemic may have also contributed to the delay, if <em>Reuters</em>&#39; report turns out to be true. We&#39;ll find out for sure when Tesla reveals its updated product roadmap before the month ends.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-production-2023-152051543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8f335c7-8db6-44c3-be19-767a734d8340</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:20:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642259709</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T15:15:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/f9f78fd0-0d05-11ea-8fee-431c6a6aa639" width="4800" height="2810" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/f9f78fd0-0d05-11ea-8fee-431c6a6aa639" width="4800" height="2810" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FREDERIC J.

And for those that hate cleaning, investing in a robot vacuum with self-emptying functionality can make it so you rarely have to interact with the machine. Two of iRobot&#39;s higher-end models with clean bases are on sale at Wellbots right now when you use the code <strong>ENGADGET250</strong> at checkout — both the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Roomba s9+</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba j7+" href="https://fave.co/3bid5zH">Roomba j7+</a> will be $250 off, bringing them down to $850 and $600, respectively. Those are great deals, especially considering the prices are better than we saw during Cyber Monday at the end of last year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3bid5zH" id="7c6b5315dd9a49a4a37ccfd9a9b4afe2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Wellbots - $600</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm" id="52eaef2463a2422eb80168e2a2073ac1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Roomba s9+ at Wellbots - $850</a><p>The Roomba j7+ is the latest robo-vac from iRobot and it has new AI-driven computer vision technology the helps it detect objects and move around them as it cleans. It&#39;s thanks to this feature that the company calls the j7 a series of &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; devices because they should be able to successfully avoid a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis — your pet&#39;s accidents. iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (or P.O.O.P. for short) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if the robot fails to avoid a run in with poop during your first year of ownership.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Otherwise, the j7 series sits right under the s9 series in iRobot&#39;s lineup, meaning it has a number of advanced features like 10x the suction power of a standard Roomba, dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, the latter of which lets you direct the vacuum to clean only certain rooms. The &quot;plus&quot; part of the j7+ refers to the clean base, or an extended part of the dock into which the vacuum will empty its debris after every job. So instead of emptying the dustbin yourself after every cleaning, you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months. Combine that with the smart controls in the iRobot mobile app and you may only have to interact with the Roomba every so often — the app lets you do things like remote start the device, set cleaning schedules and more.</p><p>The s9+ is the most advanced device that iRobot makes and it has a few differences from the j7 series. It has 40x the suction power of iRobot&#39;s standard series of vacuums and a design that helps it clean corners better. It also has a 3D sensor that helps it detect and clean around objects, although the technology is slightly different than that in the j7 series. Both are compatible with Amazon&#39;s Alexa and the Google Assistant, too, so you can control the robo-vacs with voice commands if you wish.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-roomba-j7-poop-detecting-robot-vacuum-is-250-off-right-now-150019435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1a6f30-d78a-43f7-bc5c-203b54585169</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642175077</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T15:45:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will let dating apps in the Netherlands offer third-party payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is once again honoring regulations requiring it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html">allow alternative payment options</a> in the App Store, although this one is highly specific.

The regulator determined on December 24th that Apple had abused its market power by requiring its in-app purchasing platform, and gave Apple until January 15th to make the change if it wanted to avoid fines.</p><p>Like with past decisions, Apple wasn&#39;t happy.

YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785">updated its rules</a> in 2020 to prohibit &quot;content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm.&quot; It doesn&#39;t permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities, such as the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>The organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks">considers</a> wearing masks &quot;a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.&quot; That&#39;s why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don&#39;t play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html"><em>Sky News Australia</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-suspends-one-american-news-network-221244594.html"><em>One American News Network</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-rand-paul-suspended-covid-19-misinformation-184047586.html">Senator Rand Paul</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension, because it&#39;s his first strike under the policy.

In addition to suspending his uploads, YouTube has also demonetized his channel for &quot;repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts.&quot; He will, however, be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it looks like Bongino has plans to keep on breaking YouTube&#39;s COVID-19 rules.

According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work"><em>Motherboard</em></a>, Linktree, a tool that allows you to share multiple links with one URL online, has given sex workers the boot overnight and without warning. Banned users have taken to social networks like Twitter to announce that their accounts were banned &quot;for inappropriate use&quot; and didn&#39;t even get an email or any kind of notice about it. Some were reportedly billed for the service, which costs $9 per months for the Pro tier, but weren&#39;t refunded when their account was canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlene Bonnelly, Head of Trust &amp; Safety at Linktree, told the publication that the accounts that were banned shared a URL that violated its Community Standards. Bonnelly&#39;s statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Per our company&#39;s policies, the Linktree accounts banned stemmed from sharing a URL which violated Community Standards by sharing advertisements for the sale of real-life sexual services.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sex workers make use of tools like Linktree, because some platforms don&#39;t allow linking out to adult websites such as OnlyFans directly. Perhaps more importantly, they have to diversify make use of several websites, because they&#39;ll never know when a service will suddenly decide to ban adult content.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial services like PayPal, Visa and MasterCard, have long been known <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">to close</a> the accounts of people in the business of sex. Patreon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html">banned</a> content of a sexual nature back in 2017, and the number of services that decided not to host sex workers and their content have only grown since the US government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers.html">passed</a> FOSTA-SESTA a few years ago. Even OnlyFans, which has become synonymous with adult content, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-big-banks-war-adult-content-174041161.html">tried to ban</a> &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; in 2021 until it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-suspends-ban-on-sexually-explicit-content-132256309.html">suspended</a> its planned policy change.</p><p>Linktree&#39;s Terms of Service states that a user must not &quot;include any sexually explicit material (including pictures and language) on your Page itself or your account itself.&quot; However, it&#39;s vague and not entirely clear if linking to websites like OnlyFans has always been against its rules. It&#39;s also unclear why Linktree suddenly started banning sex workers when they&#39;d been using the service without issue for quite some time, but people in the business of sex may want to find another link-sharing tool they can use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/linktree-boots-sex-workers-overnight-114707878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf74fd2e-1551-478f-9946-1d5f91c788a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 11:47:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642247229</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T11:47:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LuckyStep48 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Abstract image of a tulip in the form of a starry sky or space, consisting of points, lines, and shapes in the form of tree, stars and the universe.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the FTC and involved state attorneys general began interviewing third-party developers last year to find out if the company has put them at a disadvantage when they’ve tried to compete against its own software.</p><p>Some third-party developers claim Meta frequently copies their best ideas and then makes it harder for their apps to function on its headsets. Among other developers, the outlet points to the experience of <a href="https://t.co/FSUCfBSEfh"><ins>Virtual Desktop</ins></a> creator <a href="https://twitter.com/vrdesktop?lang=en"><ins>Guy Godin</ins></a>. In 2019, he added a feature to his app that allowed Oculus Quest owners to stream PC games to their headsets. Meta, then known as Facebook, reportedly threatened to delist the app if Godin didn’t remove the feature. That same year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-oculus-link-quest-rift-vr.html"><ins>released Oculus Link</ins></a>, a feature that allows Quest users to connect the headset to their PC via a USB-C cable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s unclear how close the FTC may be to filing formal charges against Meta. The agency declined to comment on the matter for <em>Bloomberg</em>. However, what is clear is that Meta is firmly in the FTC’s crosshairs over its various acquisitions. In December, <em>The Information </em>reported the agency had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-ftc-probe-acquisition-vr-workout-app-supernatural-within-125553153.html"><ins>opened a probe</ins></a> into its proposed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html"><ins>$400 million deal</ins></a> to buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html"><em><ins>Supernatural</ins></em></a> studio Within.

The result was that employees who worked remotely and called into meetings using a phone or PC were often more active and visible in meetings than their colleagues at the office who participated using a traditional conference room set up.</p><div id="a5caf5fd641145cc86e314edbf2639a1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYEcepAXNr0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>However, thanks to the addition of Companion Mode, office workers will soon get access to most of Google Meet’s features via Nest Hub Max or <a href="https://meetingdevices.withgoogle.com/">other certified hardware</a> like a Lenovo Tap while still being part of the shared meeting. And while the Nest Hub Max might not be a common sight in conference rooms today, this new mode could help Google push more devices to businesses of all sizes as they adapt to post-pandemic working arrangements. To join a meeting using Companion Mode, you can either activate the setting in Google Meet’s “green room” or by using a dedicated URL: g.co/companion.</p><p>Google Meet features available in Companion Mode include chatting, starting and voting on polls, raising your hand (which includes displaying a person’s name and title), using host controls and turning on captions or translations.</p><p>Google says the goal is to ensure that regardless of where you’re working from, everyone in a video call will have access to a similar set of tools and features. Companion Mode will be enabled by default, though, for people using the free version of Meet, it’s important to note that anyone using it will count as an additional participant towards the 100-person limit, instead of a room full of people counting as a single attendee.</p><p>Companion Mode in Google Meet is rolling out this week, though depending on your domain or user type, it may take another few weeks for it to be available on your device.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-companion-mode-rolling-out-to-the-nest-hub-max-195017337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2f95eb00-b4f4-4aa9-bfd4-4029fd554b94</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 20:05:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642189472</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T19:44:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1daf1020-756d-11ec-97bd-ecd72b9916f0" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1daf1020-756d-11ec-97bd-ecd72b9916f0" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA - MAY 07: The new Nest Hub Max is displayed during the 2019 Google I/O conference at Shoreline Amphitheatre on May 07, 2019 in Mountain View, California.

Facebook’s advertising policies prohibit reproductive health products or services that focus on sexual pleasure, but anecdotes from the companies the Center for Intimacy Justice either interviewed or surveyed paint the picture of a platform that enforces those guidelines in a way that’s seemingly arbitrary and sexist.</p><p>The 60 companies that took part in the report have all had advertisements rejected by Facebook at one point or another. About half said they’ve also had their accounts suspended by the social media giant. One such company is <a href="https://joylux.com/">Joylux</a>. It offers <a href="https://joylux.com/collections/vfit-and-photonic-gel/products/vfit-gold">vFit Gold</a>, a product women can use to strengthen their pelvic floor. “Because of the nature of our product, the look of it,” Joylux CEO Colette Courtion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/style/facebook-womens-sexual-health-advertising.html">told <em>The New York Times</em></a> Facebook and other companies believe it’s “pornographic” in nature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since 2017, Joylux claims Facebook has shut down its advertising account twice. It says the company never provided a reason for those actions. It also claims Facebook has automatically denied ads that include “vagina.” That’s something Meta, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook’s parent company</a>, disputes. A spokesperson for the company told Engadget<em>&nbsp;</em>it<em>&nbsp;</em>doesn’t enforce a blanket ban on keywords like “vagina” and “menopause.” Instead, it says it considers “how each ad is positioned.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe954ea0-7564-11ec-b17e-e61c9b7e780a" alt="Facebook ads" data-uuid="40023852-8aa8-3b11-8e21-c8028ab19b7a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Center for Intimacy Justice</div></figure><p>With help from an agency specializing in appealing ad rejections, Joylux has managed to get its ads up on Facebook in recent years. However, the company has had to change its copy to the point where those advertisements aren’t helpful to consumers. “We can’t show what the product looks like and we can’t say what it does,” Joylux told <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta told Engadget its enforcement isn’t perfect and that sometimes it makes mistakes. The company also noted it has its current policy in place in part because it strives to take into account what people from different countries and cultures will take away from ads that promote adult products.</p><p>“We welcome ads for sexual wellness products but we prohibit nudity and have specific rules about how these products can be marketed on our platform,” the spokesperson said. “We have provided detail to advertisers about what kinds of products and descriptions we allow in ads.”</p><p>What makes Facebook’s actions in these instances frustrating for the 60 companies that took part in the report is that they believe Meta hasn’t applied the same standards to ads targeting men. “Right now, it’s arbitrary where they’ll say a product is or isn’t allowed in a way that we think has really sexist undertones and a lack of understanding about health,” Jackie Rotman, the founder of the Center for Intimacy Justice, told <em>The Times</em>.</p><p>To that point, the organization found an ad promoting an erectile dysfunction pill that promised a “wet hot American summer.” Another, promoting a lubricant, said the lotion was “made just for men’s alone time.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/center-for-intimacy-justice-facebook-report-181456219.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2f7b64b-bc50-4f95-bc75-4e3f0f064536</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 18:14:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642184587</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T18:24:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e4a33d20-7566-11ec-95fe-60ed0535bed5" width="3025" height="2017" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e4a33d20-7566-11ec-95fe-60ed0535bed5" width="3025" height="2017" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An image of a woman holding a cell phone in front of a Facebook logo displayed on a computer screen.

The company told Sparked users the experiment will shut down on January 20th.</p><p>“We started building Sparked in late 2020 to help people find love through an experience rooted in kindness. Since then, thanks to regular input and feedback from you, we improved where we could, learned a ton, and made connections between people,” Facebook wrote in the email, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/meta-shuts-down-its-experimental-video-speed-dating-service-sparked/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> obtained. “Like many good ideas, some take off and others, like Sparked, must come to an end.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users will be able to download their data before January 20th. After that date, Facebook will wipe their Sparked accounts.</p><p>Sparked was a blend of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chatroulette/">Chatroulette</a>, the video chats other dating apps have introduced over the last few years and a speed dating event. At a predetermined time, users from a certain area or demographic would take part in dating events (there were a few global events too). They&#39;d have four minutes to chat with a potential match, and if they both wanted to spend more time with each other, they could set up a second, 10-minute date and/or exchange contact details.</p><p>Although users needed a Facebook account to use Sparked, the service was distinct from both Facebook and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook%20dating/">Facebook Dating</a>. It had no public profiles, messaging or matching features, like swiping on Tinder.</p><p>Facebook initially described Sparked as a small beta test to learn about video dating, so it might not truly have intended for the service to blow up in popularity.

What was once the reserve of audiophiles is slowly becoming a go-to gadget for those who want more than what their phone and AirPods can deliver. But they’re not without caveats. For one, they’re often expensive, and sometimes they aren’t much smaller than the phone you’re attaching them to. Enter the <a href="https://www.khadas.com/tea">Tea DAC by Khadas</a>.</p><p>Khadas started out making media-friendly single board computers (SBC - think… media-specific Raspberry Pi type things) before moving on to desktop DACs. Tea is the company’s first mobile DAC and it appears to be primarily targeted at iPhone users – though it’s also compatible with Android. The reason I suggest it’s more apt for Apple’s phones is that it’s MagSafe compatible. Combine that with the slim, iPhone-esque all-metal design and it solves one of the main problems with mobile DACs: Having something heavy hanging out the back of your phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the Tea, it sticks to the back of your phone and the low profile makes it only a little more noticeable than Apple’s own MagSafe wallets. You can, of course, find MagSafe capable cases for Android, but your phone and budget will be a factor.</p><p>Beyond the slick form factor, the Tea doesn’t scrimp on its codec support. Over USB/Lightning, the Tea can handle audio right up to 32bit/384kHz. Given that most mainstream music services don’t offer anything above 192kHz, streamers will be more than covered. Similarly, the Tea can decode MQA (Tidal) along with DSD, AAC, FLAC, APE, OGG and all the standard formats (WAV/MP3 etc.). If you prefer to go wireless, the Tea also supports LDAC and AptX HD over Bluetooth.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9b8f1f40-7495-11ec-bdf7-357e3f6165a5" alt="Tea is a mobile DAC for streaming lossless audio to your phone." data-uuid="d0791b85-3229-34e6-a30c-bfe0014a5b44"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Here I should mention that, for all its iPhone friendliness, Apple doesn’t offer either LDAC or AptX HD support in its flagship phones. You can still use the Bluetooth functionality in Tea, but you won’t be able to enjoy the higher-quality formats. Though it does at least mean you can charge your phone while still using the DAC or you can wander around with the smaller Tea connected to your headphones rather than your mobile. There are plenty of Android phones that <em>do</em> support LDAC/AptX HD, but you’ll need to check the manufacturer website to confirm (most Pixels, Samsung flagships and OnePlus phones offer LDAC/AptX HD decoding).</p><p>There are a few things you won’t find here, but most of those fall into the higher end of audio. For example, there’s only a regular 3.5mm headphone jack – no option for 2.5 or 4.4mm balanced cans at this point (though rumor has it that a “Pro” version with that might be on the way). There’s also limited feedback about what codec/audio quality you’re currently receiving, with just a simple color-changing LED indicating the format, which you can’t see unless the phone is face down. Inputs are limited to USB-C, so it’ll work with your phone and PC, but no line in.</p><p>This puts the Tea in an interesting category. It’s perfectly capable for people that want the most out of their streaming service and even should appeal to audiophiles looking for a discreet option that covers most bases. But at $199 it’s a reasonable spend. Perhaps its most obvious competitor is the BTR5 from Fiio. That’s also a portable DAC with high-res Bluetooth support along with a similar selection of cabled formats (also up to 32bit/384kHz with MQA support). Oh, and the Fiio offers a balanced headphone option, too (2.5mm). When you factor in that the BTR5 also typically retails for $159, you have to really want that slim, MagSafe design.</p><p>That’s not to undersell it though. I tested the BTR5 and the Tea side by side, and the sheer convenience of the Tea was obvious. With the Fiio, your phone feels tethered, almost weighed down by the DAC. With the Tea, it’s similar to using one of those iPhone cases with a battery in it – a little more thickness, but you can still operate the phone as you normally would.</p><p>The Tea also has a much bigger battery capacity – 1,160 mAh compared to the Fiio’s 550 mAh. This obviously isn’t an audio benefit, but it soon becomes one if you plan on listening for extended periods or being away from a charging option for more than a few hours. Which, given the mobile nature of these devices feels like a reasonable possibility.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9b2c8c0-7495-11ec-aeaf-6180f65a0d8c" alt="Tea mobile DAC connected to an iPhone." data-uuid="0aac999e-41d7-3ec3-95b0-26b7a9f38ca9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>I am, however, not a huge fan of the user interface. The Tea has three buttons: One on the left and two on the right. The single button works as a power switch or to summon your virtual assistant. The two buttons on the other side will either control volume or skip tracks. You toggle between volume and skip mode with a dual press of the power button and the top button on the other side. It works… fine, but it’s not very elegant. Also, if you leave it in track skip mode and go to adjust the volume, you’re going to be on the next track before you know it. A minor, but frustrating thing.</p><p>In wired mode, the Tea pumps out robust, loud, clear audio. It’s maybe not quite as loud as some other DACs. Even the diminutive Firefly gives the Tea a run for its money there. But, the sound you do get is clean and full of gain, and that’s the goal here: Take a good signal and let it be heard without colorization.</p><p>Beyond its primary function as a DAC, it also won’t get in the way of taking calls. A pair of mics on the base of the Tea allow you to talk without having to fall back to the mic on your phone. What’s more, the mics on the Tea are several leagues better than the one on the iPhone, especially when speaking to it while it’s resting on the desk. You can also set the Tea to charge via your phone if you’re running low on juice, or disable this feature to not tax the battery on your handset if you prefer.</p><p>All in all, the Tea is a welcome addition to a growing category. At $199 it’s not the cheapest for the feature set, but its well-thought-out design and aesthetic also make it pretty convenient and discreet. Unfortunately, if this all sounds up your alley, then you’ll have to wait a little longer. While Khadas clearly is production-ready, the company is choosing to go the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tea-ultraslim-hi-res-headphone-amplifier/coming_soon">Indiegogo route</a>, with the campaign slated to go live in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/khadas-tea-dac-magsafe-143001002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">743c2a0a-731f-471e-a697-31793445b909</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:30:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642158791</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T11:13:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db243450-73c4-11ec-bdbc-f1170c2f6472" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db243450-73c4-11ec-bdbc-f1170c2f6472" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Tea" is a MagSafe compatible DAC perfect for iPhones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tea MagSafe DAC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review: Checking a lot boxes for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I review <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html"><em>a lot</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>of true wireless earbuds, so I’m always curious what the next trends will be when companies offer their annual refresh for new products. Over the last few years, smaller sizes, better battery life and hands-free features have become the norm, but there’s only so much you can do on such a tiny device.</p><p>In 2021, Jabra set the new standard for affordable wireless earbuds with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>the Elite 3</ins></a>. At $80, it covers most of the basics quite well.Now the company is improving its mid-range option with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-price-specs-152938907.html"><ins>the Elite 4 Active</ins></a>. It’s a more workout-focused model, complete with active noise cancellation (ANC) and enough moisture protection for the sweatiest of sessions. Like it did last year, Jabra is seeking to not only make its true wireless lineup compelling in terms of features and performance, but to also make the price more competitive. T<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:his $120 model" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">his $120 model</a> delivers a lot of options that we typically see on earbuds that go for $150-$180.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Elite 4 Active carries Jabra’s new design that debuted on the Elite 3, Elite 7 Active and Elite 7 Pro last year. Instead of a mostly circular earbud with an elbow that holds the microphones, the company switched to a rounded triangle shape that offers a cleaner look. Most importantly, all of Jabra’s latest earbuds are significantly smaller than their predecessors and the Elite 4 Active continues that trend. The smaller size not only means these buds don’t stick out from your ears as much, but they’re also lighter and more comfy.</p><p>I wouldn’t blame you for mistaking the Elite 4 Active for the Elite 3. Aesthetically, the main difference is the outer panel on the 3 is one big button, while that area on the 4 Active is seamless. The button is there, but it’s sealed off. Jabra increased the water resistance to IP57 for this model, and the onboard controls are one area where it had to increase protection. Of course, Jabra has always designed its earbuds with the Active label for workouts. Better sweat protection is usually part of that formula.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e3-74ba-11ec-bffb-90a988efc117" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices. With the Elite 4 Active, you get upgrades like ANC and better water resistance over the base model Elite 3. Sound quality is good and battery life is solid, which helps make up for the lack of premium conveniences. " data-uuid="c57e6aee-ae1a-379d-b836-db1f598dcd18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The lack of a defined panel or button proved to be an issue for me when accessing the controls. I had to train myself to remember to press in the middle of the earbud as getting too far to the top or bottom wouldn’t register my actions. The outer surface of the Elite 4 Active is completely smooth, without so much as a raised dot to indicate you’re in the right place. Over time I might get used to this, but after a couple weeks of testing, I’m still not nailing it consistently.</p><p>Like every other Jabra model, you can tailor the Elite 4 Active to your needs via the company’s Sound+ app. Since this set is Jabra’s mid-range option, you get more features than the entry-level Elite 3, but not quite as much as the Elite 7 Pro or Elite 7 Active. First, there’s ANC and it’s customizable. Notice I didn’t say <em>adjustable</em>. Specifically, the app lets you set a level of noise cancellation during initial setup. You can also tweak the balance if you need more on one side than the other. Jabra will allow you to repeat this process if you need to, but there’s no easily accessible slider like the Elite 7 models.</p><p>The company’s transparency mode, HearThrough, can be controlled in the app via a slider. In fact, you can even set what the on-board control for sound mode does (single press on the left side). You can have it cycle through HearThrough and ANC, HearThrough and off or HearThrough, ANC and off. The app also allows you to turn on and off Sidetone, which lets you hear your voice when you’re on a call. Unlike some Jabra models, it isn’t adjustable – just all or nothing. Still, being able to hear yourself so you’re a bit less shouty over Zoom is better for everyone. The company’s own Find My feature returns as well, helping you locate a misplaced earbud if you’re willing to give it the proper permissions. And on Android, you can opt for one-touch access to Spotify if that’s your preferred streaming service.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e0-74ba-11ec-bfff-1dd3c0fb99f1" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices.

" data-uuid="192be981-ae78-3073-ba1a-9bce1686fb22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a $120 set of earbuds, I wouldn’t blame you for not expecting too much in the sound department. However, Jabra has a track record of solid audio across its true wireless lineup. With the Elite 4 Active, the company maintains its reputation for buds that sound good, but not great. There’s decent clarity and nice detail, but they lack the wider soundstage and depth pricier models from the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html"><ins>Sennheiser</ins></a> offer.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has pretty good sonic range, but big bombastic tracks like Run The Jewels “Mean Demeanor” and Gojira’s “Another World” sound overly compressed. The bass is solid and not muddy, so keeping the energy up during workouts with hip hop, EDM, or isn’t a problem. It’s just that on the whole, songs lack the dimensional punch you can find with a bigger investment. For $120 though, the Elite 4 Active gets the job done in most cases.</p><p>If you find yourself yearning to tweak the EQ, you can do that in the Sound+ app via a set of sliders. If one-tap audio changes are more your style, Jabra also offers a collection of presets for quick customization. It’s not the most robust set of options for dialing in the sound, but it’s more than you get on the ultra affordable Elite 3.</p><p>One advantage the Elite 4 Active has over the Elite 3 is active noise cancellation. As I mentioned, you can customize the feature to a degree, but it’s not as powerful as what’s on Jabra’s pricer earbuds. Still, the ANC here will help block out some distractions, just don’t expect it to do a lot of heavy lifting.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has four microphones for calls. Jabra says they’re covered with a “special mesh” to reduce wind noise when you’re outdoors. Typically, mileage varies greatly on call quality with true wireless earbuds. Most of the time you just end up sounding like you’re on speakerphone. With the Elite 4 Active, the call quality is slightly better, but still not as good as if you had a microphone closer to your mouth – or even pointed more towards your face. Background noise is reduced when you’re talking, but any environmental roar is distracting when you’re not.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f37de552-4588-4246-b24a-6321b5ec3595"/><p>Jabra says you can expect up to seven hours of battery life on the Elite 4 Active, with three additional charges in the case for a total of 28 hours. The company doesn’t specify whether or not that’s with ANC on, but in my tests I managed seven and a half hours with noise canceling active. It’s by no means the best battery life you’ll find in true wireless earbuds, but it’s certainly enough to get you through a workday if you take a break or two. If you run out of juice before you head out the door, a quick charge feature gives you an hour of use in 10 minutes.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:At $120" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">At $120</a>, Jabra is offering solid mid-range specs at the same price as some companies’ budget models. What’s more, most of those don’t offer ANC, let alone a transparency mode or customizable sound. Samsung put noise canceling inside of its cheapest true wireless model with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html"><ins>Galaxy Buds 2</ins></a>. These earbuds are tiny and comfy and wireless charging is included, but the ANC performance is just okay. Plus, the Galaxy Buds 2 are only IPX2 rated, so you’ll want to be careful about how wet you get them. Full price they’re $150, but we’ve seen them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-2-are-back-on-sale-for-100-143041841.html"><ins>as low as $100</ins></a>.</p><p>If you’re looking to maximize your dollars, I’d suggest looking into Anker’s Soundcore line. You can find a lot of value, and features, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html"><ins>for well under $100</ins></a> there. Plus, the company’s top-of-the-line flagship ANC model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html"><ins>the Liberty 3 Pro</ins></a>, is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:only $170" href="https://amzn.to/34E5QlA">only $170</a>. And if you’re good with passive noise isolation, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>Jabra’s own Elite 3</ins></a> can get the job done <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:for $60" href="https://amzn.to/3KkwjVU">for $60</a>.</p><p>If Jabra’s new mission is to deliver the same overall quality as its previous earbuds at more affordable prices, I’m here for it. With the Elite 4 Active, as it did with the Elite 3, the company has managed to offer a compelling set of features at a great price. It hasn’t cut corners to do so, improving details like design and fit while maintaining its standard for sound quality. There are some omissions, but all the basics are covered and for the most part done well. Once again, we have more evidence that you don’t need to spend over $150 in order to get a set of good true wireless earbuds.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-review-140024466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f2a5b69-54f8-4281-adfd-2758abc415ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642112077</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T22:14:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Final Fantasy XIV' will go back on sale on January 25th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New players will be able to purchase digital copies of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> again starting on January 25th, the game&#39;s director and producer Naoki Yoshida has <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9a6bed5c06ae511c363ece5ead0a98a3986554a2">announced</a> in a lengthy post.

The world transfer service is currently suspended, but it will resume on January 26th — further, those transferring to the new Oceanian Worlds will be able to do so for free.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yoshida has also revealed that Square Enix has been working on expanding its Japanese, European and North American data centers. The company explained that due to the global semiconductor shortage, it took some time to procure the needed components to be able to bring them online. In fact, it has to establish the new data centers in phases, because it&#39;s still having a tough time securing the necessary server equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>For North America, the first phase of the expansion will happen sometime in August 2022, and it will see four new Worlds go online. The second phase will be implemented in the summer of 2023 and will open four more Worlds.  For Japan, the developer plans to add one more logical data center to the current three in order to lower the number of Worlds for each of them. The European expansion will also happen in two phases, the first of which is scheduled for July 2022 and will bring four new Worlds online. In the summer of 2023, Square Enix will establish one new logical data center with eight new Worlds in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once again, I wish to apologize for the delays to server expansion caused by the global semiconductor shortage,&quot; Yoshida wrote. He also asked for players&#39; understanding in resuming sales of the game, even though some may consider the decision to be premature. Square Enix will monitor server stability following the resumption of sales and could restart free trials if everything goes well. However, in case servers &quot;continue to experience extreme levels of congestion&quot; despite all the steps it&#39;s taking, the developer may consider suspending digital sales once again.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-back-on-sale-january-25th-133146587.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24ba88cf-cb91-40b3-8acd-8f7a99a3649a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:31:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642168144</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T02:01:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft opens a third-party review into its harassment and discrimination policies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has hired a third -party law firm to review its policies on sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883416/microsoft-board-harassment-discrimination-report"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported. As part of that, the final report will summarize the results of sexual harassment investigations against the company&#39;s senior leadership and board of directors, including  former CEO Bill Gates.&nbsp;</p><p>The report will &quot;lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company&#39;s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies,&quot; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56">press release</a>. It will also &quot;assess the steps that have been taken to hold employees, including executives, accountable for sexual harassment or gender discrimination,&quot; and include the number of sexual harassment cases investigated and their resolution.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>[The report] will lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company&#39;s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies. This will include a review of concerns raised by employees in 2019 in the “In Need of Assistance” email thread, steps the company has taken to respond to these concerns, and additional steps that could further strengthen these safeguards. The review will also include an analysis of policies, practices, and commitments to create a safe, inclusive work environment.</p></blockquote><p>Microsoft had been planning to disclose how it implements sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, with a key request being the disclosure of executive-level investigations. However, late last year, Microsoft shareholders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html">forced the company</a> to write up an annual report detailing how it handles sexual harassment cases within the company.&nbsp;</p><p>The review will be conducted by the law firm Arent Fox and will look at allegations of discrimination and harassment arising from an internal <a href="https://qz.com/1587477/microsoft-investigating-sexual-harassment-claims-overlooked-by-hr/">Microsoft email chain</a> back in 2019. In over 90 pages of emails, female employees alleged that they were harassed and denied promotions and pay raises, among other issues. They further complained that managers and the company&#39;s HR department took no action in many cases. Microsoft was also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-13-microsoft-faces-238-complaints-of-gender-discrimination-harassment.html">accused</a> of 238 cases of gender discrimination or sexual harassment in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>While the board will assess the previous investigation against Gates, it won&#39;t reinvestigate the affair that happened in 2000. Gates resigned from Microsoft&#39;s board in early March of 2020, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803">reportedly</a> before the investigation was complete.</p><p>&quot;We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hires-an-outside-firm-to-review-its-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-132048142.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0200492-ec42-429e-9673-1a617a4ba7c0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:20:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642164961</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T12:56:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of Microsoft Corporation headquarters at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris,  France, April 18, 2016.

Take the Xperia 5 III. After launching in other regions <em>last year</em>, the phone is only now available stateside for $1,000. This is its middle-ish high-end phone, with the flagship Xperia 1 series of smartphones (seen above) both bigger and pricier.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-high-end-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000-095934384.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9131cfc0-7535-11ec-8fff-5d8b67023191" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="0b89caea-854b-3b8d-8d14-c4c9cda03c86"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>For that price, this Xperia does have things to offer.

On Twitter, Thomas said that Block aims to &quot;make mining more distributed and efficient in every way, from buying, to set up, to maintenance, to mining.&quot; As such, Block has identified the pain points and the technical challenges of the process, starting with availability, since rigs are hard to find and and are expensive. Block has to find a way to make them more accessible to be able to meet its objective.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also wants to build a reliable system that addresses current rigs&#39; usual issues with heat dissipation and dust. Plus, Block is looking into striking the right balance between performance and other factors, such as making sure the rig is efficient while having low power consumption. Thomas said Block is also thinking of which partners to consider for the project and has already started building out a core engineering team to working on solutions and answer for all its questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Dorsey is a big believer in cryptocurrency and even once <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473089482576564225">said</a> that he believes bitcoin will replace the dollar one day. Block had invested heavily in cryptocurrency and <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/jack-dorseys-square-doubles-its-money-on-bitcoin-investment">reportedly</a> holds 8,027 bitcoins or around US$338 million, based on current value.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorseys-block-is-officially-building-an-open-bitcoin-mining-system-114033482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc6420aa-a280-4656-9ab2-399459afb905</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 11:40:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642158760</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T11:12:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b08eca30-67a7-11ec-bfef-a5351ba20ef6" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b08eca30-67a7-11ec-bfef-a5351ba20ef6" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Westend61 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Three dimensional render of single Bitcoin standing inside gold mine]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
