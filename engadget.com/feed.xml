This, however, should make the entire process of managing a Windows installation on a far-off server far simpler. You just need to head to Windows365.com when it launches on August 2nd (it isn&#39;t yet live), choose a virtual machine configuration and you&#39;ll be up and running. That is, of course, once we know what it costs. Final pricing will be revealed the day before the service launches.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fix-safari-tab-bar-design-third-ios-15-mac-os-monterey-beta-180648751.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">Apple gives the people what they want: their old Safari tab design back</a></h2><h3>The latest macOS and iOS betas address a common complaint about the new Safari.</h3><h3></h3><p>The third developer betas for iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey started rolling out today, and key among the changes is a set of updates to Apple&#39;s browser.

Developed by researchers at <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis">UC San Francisco</a>, the technique is a more natural way for people with speech loss to communicate than other methods <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">we&#39;ve seen</a> to date.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, neuroprosthetic technology has only allowed paralyzed users to type out just one letter at a time, a process that can be slow and laborious. It also tapped parts of the brain that control the arm or hand, a system that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive for the subject.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The USCF system, however, uses an implant that&#39;s placed directly on the part of the brain dedicated to speech. That way, the subject can mentally activate the brain patterns they would normally use to say a word, and the system can translate the entire word, rather than single letters, to the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it work, patients with normal speech volunteered to have their brain recordings analyzed for speech related activities. Researchers were then able to analyze those patterns and develop new methods to decode them in real time, using statistical language models to improve accuracy.&nbsp;</p><div id="9dc1b71b29ca4459a6eefda9c48dd6ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GMcf1fXdW8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, the team still wasn&#39;t sure if brain signals controlling the vocal tract would still be intact in patients paralyzed for many years. To that end, they enlisted an anonymous participant (known as Bravo1) who worked with researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary that the team could decipher using advanced computer algorithms. That included words like &quot;water,&quot; &quot;family&quot; and &quot;good,&quot; enough to allow the patient to create hundreds of sentences applicable to their daily life. The team also used an &quot;auto-correct&quot; function similar to those found on consumer speech recognition apps.&nbsp;</p><p>To test the system, the team asked patient Bravo1 to reply to questions like &quot;How are you today?&quot; and &quot;Would you like some water?&quot; The patient&#39;s attempted speech then appeared on the screen as &quot;I am very good,&quot; and &quot;No, I am not thirsty.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The system was able to decode their speech at up to 18 words per minute with 93 percent accuracy, with a 75 percent median accuracy. That might not sound great compared to the 200 words per minute possible with normal speech, but it&#39;s much better than the speeds seen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">previous neuroprosthetic systems</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak,” said Edward Chang, MD,  Chair of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and senior author on the study. “It shows strong promise to restore communication by tapping into the brain&#39;s natural speech machinery.”</p><p>The team said the trial represents a proof of principal for this new type of &quot;speech neuroprosthesis.&quot; Next up, they plan to expand the trial to include more participants, while also working to increase the number of words in the vocabulary and improve the rate of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/severely-paralyzed-man-communicates-using-brain-signals-sent-to-his-vocal-tract-110524126.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">788eefc6-08c2-4fe2-b7be-694819d33ec7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:05:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626345334</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T10:35:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UCSF]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's SmartThings app can now track your energy usage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is catering its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/smartthings">SmartThings</a> app updates to our changing lifestyles.

The commission voted by 3-1 to approve the legal complaint to compel Amazon to recall the named products, notify customers who purchased them and offer full refunds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/recall/lawsuits/abc/001-In-re-Amazon-com-Inc__.pdf?TvLLxHy1UMfiz3BpfXaKjQy1ibQbYAiU">lawsuit</a>, the retailer has already taken some of those actions. Amazon removed the identification numbers for the specified products, the CPSC said. The company also informed consumers who had purchased the goods that they could present a hazard and offered to compensate them with gift cards credited to their account, the regulator noted. But, the CPSC insisted that Amazon&#39;s &quot;unilateral&quot; response was insufficient.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-sues-amazon-demands-recall-hazardous-products-2021-07-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon said it was &quot;unclear&quot; why the CPSC rejected its offer to expand its recall program, including for products sold by third parties, or sued to force actions &quot;almost entirely duplicative&quot; of those it had taken. The retailer added that it had removed &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the products in question from its store and provided full customer refunds.</p><p>“Today’s vote to file an administrative complaint against Amazon was a huge step forward for this small agency,” said the CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler. “But it’s a huge step across a vast desert—we must grapple with how to deal with these massive third-party platforms more efficiently, and how best to protect the American consumers who rely on them.”</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Amazon has been lambasted for its distribution of hazardous items. Last year, a <em>CNN</em> investigation into customer reviews on the site<em>&nbsp;</em>found 70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">AmazonBasics</a> items had been associated with fires. A 2019 report by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also claimed that Amazon was selling more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">4,000 items</a> that federal agencies had declared unsafe, prompting<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-senators-amazon-unsafe-products-letter.html"> Senators to write to then CEO Jeff Bezos </a>for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Last fall, a California state appeals court ruled that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-liable-defective-thirdparty-products-135528763.html">can be held liable</a> for damages and injuries caused by faulty products sold on its third-party marketplace.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cpsc-amazon-lawsuit-hazardous-products-091349726.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94dc119f-411c-4432-8c84-ccca59e14a56</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 09:13:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626340431</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T09:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Amazon delivery worker pulls a delivery cart full of packages during its annual Prime Day promotion in New York City, U.S., June 21, 2021.

The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5cs/">AmpliTube modeling software</a> offers the ability to use popular effects, amps and cabinets via digital modeling rather than the hardware itself. But the app resides on computer <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigstompio/?pkey=irig-stomp-io">or tablet</a>, so it&#39;s not exactly the most convenient thing to take on the road. Today, IK Multimedia is debuting the AmpliTube X-GEAR line: a collection of four guitar pedals equipped with versions of the same effects available on the robust desktop software.&nbsp;</p><p>The AmpliTube X-GEAR pedals offer options for distortion (X-DRIVE), modulation (X-VIBE), delay (X-TIME) and reverb (X-SPACE). All four pedals are loaded with 16 different effects and IK Multimedia developed new algorithms for both reverb and delay. The company says that despite giving users a different set of tools, each of the X-GEAR devices uses the same hardware and digital signal processing (DSP).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/38514d80-e50d-11eb-aaf3-19d06510fb75" style="height:1298;width:1600;" alt="IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR" data-uuid="25bf4733-6eca-3998-a9cd-3393c024b808"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IK Multimedia</div></figure><p>Because these are based on powerful software, IK Multimedia says the X-GEAR pedals work well in both the studio and on stage. With the desktop app (AmpliTube SE is included with the pedals), you can make changes and save settings, including up to 300 presets, back to the hardware pedal as needed. Thanks to up to 192kHz internal processing and oversampling, the company says the X-GEAR pedals can give you the same &quot;realism and response&quot; as AmpliTube on the desktop.</p><p>Each X-GEAR pedal is housed in an aluminum shell with 24-bit/192kHz converters to keep noise at a minimum and 5Hz–24kHz frequency response. IK Multimedia says the frequency response combined with an analog dry path and selectable true or soft bypass will allow your guitar&#39;s tone to come through unfiltered. When it&#39;s time to record, the X-GEAR pedals can serve as a USB interface with a digital audio workstation (DAW). You can select between wet or dry signals, use a stereo output for monitoring and employ full MIDI compatibility. On stage, pair any item in the X-GEAR lineup with an expression pedal and you&#39;ll get even more control of each of the parameters on board. There are also five cabinet options on each pedal so you can connect them directly to a PA if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The X-GEAR pedals go on sale in August for $300 each, but you can pre-order them now <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/xgear/">from the company&#39;s website</a>. That price puts IK Multimedia&#39;s latest gear just below multi-effects options like <a href="https://www.strymon.net/product-category/effects-pedals/">Strymon&#39;s BlueSky and Mobius pedals</a>. A key difference though is that IK Multimedia is known for mobile audio interfaces, MIDI controllers and software plug-ins while companies like Strymon are well-respected in the guitar world thanks to their established track records. This is really the first time IK Multimedia has built what many would consider &quot;real&quot; effects pedals, so it will be interesting to see if the company successfully leveraged its software expertise for this new hardware.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="242bea21-4079-4db3-8c66-3752382d8c0d"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ik-multimedia-amplitube-x-gear-pedals-073045987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccb8cad3-4848-4076-ab77-48fe317d576d</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626314132</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T01:55:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IK Multimedia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Delta pilot sues the airline for allegedly stealing an app he designed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">Delta</a> pilot has sued the airline for $1 billion, accusing it of trade secrets theft over a communications app he developed a few years ago. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/delta-pilot-sues-airline-for-1-billion-claiming-stolen-crew-app"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Captain Craig Alexander pitched the QrewLive app, which he reportedly developed with $100,000 of his own money, to the company as a way for crew to easily communicate in case of disrupted flights. However, Delta turned him down and then launched what he says is an identical tool a few years later.</p><p>Alexander apparently contacted Delta CEO Ed Bastian back in 2016 after a computer system meltdown put <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">all flights on hold</a> and cost the company over $150 million. He told the CEO that he had a solution for issues like that, which resulted to several meetings with executives who <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/pilot-files-intellectual-property-lawsuit-against-delta/YM3GFTE3UNFOJMXOEWGUMYQIN4/">gave him</a> verbal assurances that they were going to acquire his app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Alexander&#39;s complaint, Delta ended up telling him that his technology didn&#39;t fit its needs and ultimately launched its own Flight Family Communications app in 2018. He called the official Delta app a &quot;carbon copy, knock-off of the role-based text messaging component of [his] proprietary QrewLive communications platform.&quot; As for how he decided to seek $1 billion in damages, he said it&#39;s &quot;based solely upon operational cost savings to Delta, [which] conservatively exceeds $1 billion.&quot;</p><p>The plaintiff has been with the airline for 11 years and still currently works with the company. Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;While we take the allegations specified in Mr. Alexander&#39;s complaint seriously, they are not an accurate or fair description of Delta&#39;s development of its internal crew messaging platform.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/delta-pilot-sues-airline-app-063637349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc54dfb2-9b56-4fab-8735-125708018c07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 06:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626331035</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T06:37:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mindaugas Dulinskas via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Narita, Japan - January 25, 2017: N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix will reportedly offer video games within the next year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Netflix</a> may be a TV show, movie <em>and</em> game streaming platform in the near future. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-plans-to-offer-video-games-in-expansion-beyond-films-tv"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has hired Mike Verdu, a former Oculus and EA exec, as vice president of game development. Verdu was the VP of augmented and virtual reality games and content at Facebook, where he worked with developers for the Oculus Rift, Quest and Go. From 2017 to 2018, he was also the head of EA Mobile and oversaw the studios that worked on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>, <em>SimCity BuildIt</em>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> and <em>Sims Free Play</em>, among others.</p><p>The company will reportedly build out its gaming team in the coming months to be able to start offering games for streaming within the next year. Netflix isn&#39;t exactly inexperienced in the area and previously developed games based on its popular shows. However, it released those titles on mobile and consoles — <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company won&#39;t be making a separate platform for its upcoming video games and will instead make them available alongside its shows and movies under their own category. Also, the streaming giant reportedly has no plans to charge extra for game access, though it&#39;s unclear if the additional content will lead to a future price hike.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With competitors popping up left and right, Netflix has been looking for ways to grow and make sure it stays ahead, especially in saturated markets like the US. Adding video games to its repertoire seems to be the answer it came up with recently. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"><em>The Information</em></a> first reported that the company was seeking to hire an executive who&#39;d oversee its expansion into video games back in May. Apparently, Netflix approached several veteran execs in the industry regarding the position. Back then, a company spokesperson told <em>The Information</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve continually expanded our offering— from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like <em>Bandersnatch</em> and <em>You v. Wild</em>, or games based on <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>L Casa de Papel</em> and <em>To All the Boys</em>. So we&#39;re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13aacd9-23ac-48a7-8a2c-36ba57da0684</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626332733</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T11:01:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Calgary, Alberta.

If all you want to do is use AirPlay, you don’t have to do anything special; the feature is enabled by default after installing the new software.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-airplay-2-homekit-update-013526800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">860cf3b2-c7ff-4058-a1da-0ebdc8b42ce5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 01:35:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626303284</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T22:54:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8ccb4520-e4d9-11eb-bf77-a33a47efdb54" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8ccb4520-e4d9-11eb-bf77-a33a47efdb54" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toshiba]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toshiba 4K UHD Fire TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toshiba 4K UHD Fire TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teenage Engineering's OP-1 synth update brings USB audio streaming 10 years after release]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten years after its initial release, Teenage Engineering still finds ways to surprise and delight with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-27-teenage-engineering-op-1-synthesizer-gets-priced-at-799-cant.html"><ins>OP-1</ins></a>.

That&#39;s about to change, and eventually you&#39;ll no longer need to have a phone nearby to use WhatsApp on the web, macOS, Windows or Portal.</p><p>Starting today, WhatsApp will invite users to try its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html"><ins>multi-device beta</ins></a>. You&#39;ll be able to use the service on your phone and up to four other devices (as long as they also aren&#39;t phones). WhatsApp will try the multi-device approach with a small group of people from its beta program. They&#39;ll be able to opt out of the beta later. With the help of those users, WhatsApp will optimize the multi-device experience and add some more features before rolling it out more broadly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although many users have been requesting multi-device support, it&#39;s taken WhatsApp some time to make that happen. It has built a system that retains end-to-end encryption while letting people sync data like contact names, archives and starred messages across devices.</p><p>Until now, the WhatsApp smartphone app has been an essential conduit for the service. Other platforms like the web and desktop apps maintain a consistent, secure link to the phone app and mirror the content. But if your phone battery dies or there&#39;s an issue with the smartphone app, you can&#39;t use WhatsApp on other platforms.</p><p>Through the multi-device beta, each device will have its own identity key. Currently, users have a single identity key (i.e. the one on their phone) to handle encrypted messages. WhatsApp has <a href="https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/217392192_617386875906350_2307693746154839727_n.pdf/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_V4_Preview.pdf?ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=2fbf2a&amp;_nc_ohc=4NBatF5TfzwAX-aVLCC&amp;_nc_oc=AQmcb-mK8YRXFKR50jznycD5iL0Wr-cAEL2STU9EfokAGZIq6Fn9thP2YmymlwHht6o&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&amp;oh=e9995b3578767e0defaf6163c8a1424e&amp;oe=60F4C687">developed systems</a> it says will keep out eavesdroppers who try to add devices to a user&#39;s account and to minimize the number of times people need to confirm their identity across devices. You&#39;ll also have control over connected devices and see which ones are linked to your account.</p><p>Along with messages, WhatsApp will have E2EE support for voice and video calls as part of the multi-device beta. There won&#39;t be any impact on the way WhatsApp handles cloud backups.&nbsp;</p><p>Solving the issue of supporting E2EE across a user&#39;s devices can be tricky given that only devices that messages are sent to and from are supposed to be able to decrypt them. Apple seems to have found an answer — iMessage supports E2EE across Apple devices. Although Telegram works on multiple devices, its E2EE approach (Secret Chats) <a href="https://tsf.telegram.org/manuals/e2ee-simple"><ins>does not currently do so</ins></a>. Like WhatsApp&#39;s current setup, Signal&#39;s desktop app also needs to <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360008216551-Installing-Signal&#92;">connect to a smartphone</a> to send and receive messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-phone-multi-device-end-to-end-encryption-192123565.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60c61ae4-bbfb-48a7-ad18-2c50b6dbefde</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290557</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:22:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter removed a lot more abusive content in the second half of 2020 than ever before]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is getting better at moderating its platform. That’s one of the main takeaways from the company’s most <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/an-update-to-the-twitter-transparency-center"><ins>recent transparency report</ins></a>, which it shared on Wednesday.  Between July 1st and December 31st, 2020, Twitter says it took action against 964,459 accounts for abusive behavior. Compared to the first six months of 2020, that’s a 142 percent increase. Over the same timeframe, Twitter also removed more hateful content. On that front, the company says it took action against 1,126,990 accounts, a 77 percent increase from the 635,415 accounts it reprimanded in the first half of 2020.</p><p>What’s notable here is that the company attributes the latter increase to policy changes it put in place throughout 2020. Specifically, it calls out the fact that it began taking action on &quot;content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories&quot; as a result of an uptick in harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also calls out an expansion of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hate-speech-rules-race-ethnicity-194849330.html">hateful conduct policy</a> in early December that saw the company prohibit language that “dehumanizes” people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin. Not mentioned in the report — but likely still something that had a positive effect — is the ban the company put in place in July against links to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-links-hateful-conduct-violence-010623900.html"><ins>content that promotes violence and hateful conduct</ins></a>.</p><p>In another part of the report, Twitter also attributes its recent success to better technology. As of the second half of last year, the company claims its automated moderation tools helped it take action against 65 percent of abusive tweets and other behavior before someone had to flag the content for its moderators. To put that percentage in perspective, those tools were about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-twitter-says-better-spotting-abusive-tweets-than-users.html"><ins>50 percent effective</ins></a> by late 2019.</p><p>Obviously, Twitter has yet to completely stop abuse, harassment and hate speech from taking place on its platform, but today’s report shows the company is at least making progress on its 2019 promise to “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-twitter-jack-dorsey-public-square-health.html"><ins>increase the health of public conversation</ins></a>.”&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-second-half-2020-transparency-report-184953614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e4cd13-e7a9-452f-90d1-11a68da11289</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626288596</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:50:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Safari is getting some design updates, including easier access to reloading, sharing and Tab Groups in macOS Monterey, as well as improved navigation features in iOS 15.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the changes in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html#safari">macOS Monterey beta that we didn&#39;t like</a> was the removal of the tabs bar. Senior editor Devindra Hardawar pointed out that while the new menu in its place allowed Apple to devote more screen space to website content, it made sorting through your tabs messy and tedious. With today&#39;s beta release, though, Apple&#39;s brought back the standalone Tab bar, which will be enabled by default, like it was on Big Sur.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, you&#39;ll also get one-click access to controls including Reload and Sharing, as well as access to new features like Tab Groups from the toolbar. If you liked the thin menu that gave you more space for browsing, you can still adopt it, and Apple&#39;s refined this to make it easier to see page titles while you rack up more tabs.</p><p>These changes will also come to iPadOS in a future beta update, which is nice since deputy editor Nathan Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html#safari">also criticized the removal of the tab bar in our preview</a>.</p><p>On iOS 15, Apple&#39;s tweaked Safari to make it easier to use with one hand. When you&#39;re entering a search, the field will now appear on top of the keyboard so it&#39;s nearer the bottom of the screen, making it easier to edit your query. When you&#39;re done typing, you can dismiss the keyboard by swiping down on it. Apple also added a Reload option to the long-press menu on the left side of the tab bar.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven&#39;t already, you can enroll in Apple&#39;s beta program to check these previews out for yourself. But be warned, you&#39;ll need to be sure you want to risk running potentially unstable software. If you can&#39;t wait a bit longer for the stable release, make sure you back up your data before installing the updates.

Gameplay will otherwise be the same on all platforms, including weather events like tornados.</p><p>Cross-progression is in the works too. Your progress and items (including ones you buy) will carry over from one platform to another, so if you hop between PC and PlayStation or Xbox, you’ll have access to all of your gear.</p><p>Elsewhere, DICE plans to use bots to fill out lobbies when needed to improve matchmaking and perhaps get you into matches faster. You can&#39;t opt out from using the bots, though players will always have priority over AI soldiers. If a player leaves mid-game, a bot will take over until someone else joins.&nbsp;</p><p>The bots should act in a similar way to human players, though they won&#39;t be able to use wingsuits or class-based abilities. The AI soldiers can carry out other tasks, like reviving teammates, calling in vehicles and capturing objectives. You’ll be able to battle bots in solo and co-op modes too.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-briefing-answering-your-reveal-questions">a blog post</a> covering these tidbits, DICE and EA spilled the beans about some other features, including vehicles, fully customizable loadouts and how different modes focus on certain areas of maps. Meanwhile, DICE said you won&#39;t be able to fight on every floor of a skyscraper, only the lobby and rooftop. More details about <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>will be revealed at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html">EA Play Live event</a> on July 22nd.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-cross-play-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-pc-174805910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b8be361-d8a9-4024-b722-baf16775e142</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:48:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290786</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:26:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA / DICE]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clubhouse unveils its new 'Backchannel' DM feature]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clubhouse, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-launches-its-clubhouse-live-audio-rival-greenroom-130034550.html">oft</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">cloned</a> invite-only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html">audio chat platform</a> that recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-clubhouse-android-app-is-now-available-worldwide-082506070.html">expanded to Android</a>, has since its inception lacked a seemingly fundamental feature present on virtually every other social media app: the ability to directly message other users.

Now all that’s in between you and the company&#39;s futuristic TV is an “Add to Cart” button and about the cost of a down payment on a house in the Bay Area.</p><p>For that amount of money, you get a 65-inch 4K TV that can take on different viewing positions. In its signature “Line View” mode, only part of the OLED R is visible to display the time, weather and other bits of information. It’s also possible to lower the display to do away with letterboxing when watching a movie. Other features include support for Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.

Most people assumed it was Chrome’s way of saying the website they were visiting was trustworthy, which is a potentially risky leap to make.

The company announced that it&#39;s pushing out the third beta of Android 12 today, and it brings features like scrolling screenshots, enhanced auto-rotate and more. For developers, Google said this is the &quot;last beta release before the Platform Stability milestone,&quot; which means they can begin to test their apps for the next platform. Beta 3 will also include the final Android 12 APIs and official SDK.&nbsp;</p><p>Those may not seem obviously impactful for the average user. What will feel more immediately useful are  scrolling screenshots, which Google said will work &quot;out-of-the-box for most apps.&quot; With Beta 3, when you snap an image of your screen, you&#39;ll see a new &quot;Capture more&quot; button. Tap that, and you&#39;ll extend the boundaries of your screenshot to get all the content available, after which you can adjust the crop. Google said it&#39;s &quot;continuing to iterate on scrolling screenshots&quot; and &quot;also working to provide support for a wider variety of content (such as web content),&quot; so it&#39;s possible this version isn&#39;t what you&#39;ll see when Android 12 officially launches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e49b8330-e422-11eb-bbff-c0081a18321d" alt="Two screenshots showing how the scrolling screenshot feature in the third Android 12 beta will work.

As opposed to relying only on accelerometers/gyroscopes to detect the orientation of your phone, this can make auto-rotate more responsive. It&#39;s &quot;especially helpful for people who are using their devices while lying down on a couch or in bed, for example,&quot; Google said. If you don&#39;t like the idea of your camera being used to see how you&#39;re holding up your phone, it may help to know that the company said the feature lives in its Private Compute Core and the &quot;images are never stored or sent off the device.&quot; Enhanced auto-rotate will be available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">the Pixel 4</a> and newer Pixel devices.</p><p>If you&#39;re on an older or non-Pixel phone, you&#39;ll also see some improvements. Google said it &quot;optimized the animation and redrawing and added an ML-driven gesture-detection algorithm&quot; that&#39;s reduced the base auto-rotate feature&#39;s latency by 25 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature on Beta 3 is platform support for Google&#39;s on-device search engine called AppSearch. It&#39;ll allow developers to offer better search tools in their apps, and also offer them the option of participating in a central index &quot;that&#39;s maintained for the entire system in Android 12 (and later releases).&quot; Those who opt-in to the central index will enable Google to show data from their apps in overall system searches. Developers can also choose to &quot;securely share data with other apps, allowing them to search your app&#39;s data as well as their own.&quot; That means one day, if they decide to enable it, apps like Tinder and Spotify could search data within your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram apps, for example.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/542d42a0-e424-11eb-bfae-276b7526579b" alt="An animation showing how Game Modes will work in Android 12 when the upcoming game dashboard arrives later this year.

Many other features on Beta 3 are also behind-the-scenes, like the new ability for enterprises to set camera and mic restrictions on devices they manage. Android 12&#39;s Game Mode APIs will let developers respond appropriately to different profiles selected by the player, &quot;like better battery life for a long commute, or performance mode to get peak frame rates,&quot; for example. These will be part of an &quot;upcoming game dashboard which provides an overlay experience with quick access to key utilities during gameplay&quot; that will be available on select devices later this year.</p><p>We&#39;re still eagerly awaiting the addition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">the Material You design</a> scheme that Google unveiled at I/O earlier this year, but as Android 12 approaches platform stability and a final release, it looks like most of the features we were expecting are here. If you&#39;re eager to test out this preview and can&#39;t wait for the official launch, you can enroll in Google&#39;s beta program. As always, we must caution that preview software is not guaranteed to be stable and you should back up your data before installing the beta. Whether you check out this early build or wait for a little longer, it does seem like a meaty update is coming for Android users that could be worth the anticipation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-3-update-available-today-scrolling-screenshot-170040876.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bdc0305-7527-486f-8bc7-70304612166a</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626275837</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T15:17:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12 Beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12 Beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Vive Focus 3 is the best standalone VR headset and no, you should not buy it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-28-oculus-rift-review.html">Oculus Rift</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-htc-vive-review.html">HTC Vive</a> launched in 2016, bringing virtual reality into homes for the first time, the two companies have gone in very different directions. While Oculus leaned more toward mainstream consumers, especially with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">last year’s Quest 2</a>, the Vive targeted businesses and the tech savvy. That strategy hasn&#39;t always worked out in Vive&#39;s favor — the long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-htc-vive-cosmos-review.html">Cosmos headset was a disappointment </a>— but it probably makes more sense than competing with Facebook&#39;s practically limitless resources head-on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="73158178-a34e-45b4-b58b-679f8dfba9d2"/><p>Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">Vive Focus 3</a>, a $1,300 standalone headset that&#39;s really only meant for businesses. Because it costs $1,000 more than the Oculus Quest 2, the Focus 3 unsurprisingly offers better hardware, ergonomics and build quality than Oculus&#39;s headset. It&#39;s the difference between building a device that&#39;s meant to be used throughout the day in professional settings, and something you may use once in a while for gaming. The Vive Focus 3 is meant to get shit done.</p><p>At first glance, the Focus 3 certainly looks more like a premium VR workhorse than the Quest 2. While the Oculus headset has flimsy cloth straps and a minimalist goggle design, the Focus 3 looks like an expensive pair of ski goggles fashioned into a VR device. Its magnesium alloy frame is still technically plastic, but it feels sturdier than the Quest&#39;s flimsy case (HTC Vive claims it’s 20 percent lighter and five times stronger than traditional plastic). As much as I liked the Quest 2, you can instantly feel how much Oculus skimped on its materials to reach that low $299 price.</p><p>While Oculus leaned into the sleek and curvy Apple gadget aesthetic, HTC Vive went for sharper lines and a more elaborate design. The Focus 3&#39;s headstrap, for example, looks far more involved with a plastic frame, tons of cushioning and a rear dial to tighten everything up. It&#39;s also angled around the sides so it never touches your ears, which goes a long way toward making the VR experience feel more comfortable. The rear part of the strap may look chunky, but that&#39;s because it also houses the Focus 3&#39;s battery pack. Putting a bit more junk in the trunk helps to balance its weight, so it&#39;s not leaning down on your nose uncomfortably like some earlier VR headsets. (The Quest 2&#39;s Elite Strap and rear battery pack offers a similarly balanced feel, so the Focus 3&#39;s design isn&#39;t completely innovative.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/287a07d0-e4bd-11eb-b5bf-6bb30a5c0665" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="438d8813-5011-3c22-a7bf-034ac2c5d1c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Focus 3&#39;s battery pack is removable, which allows businesses to keep a single headset running continuously throughout the day. One downside to this unique battery design is that the Focus 3 charges via a proprietary AC adapter, despite having a USB-C port. As a concession, the company includes a dual USB-C cable that connects to the headset and can charge both controllers simultaneously. Your desk may end up looking like a sea of cables, but at least you can make sure all your VR gear is charged.</p><p>While its design shows just how much HTC Vive has learned over the years, it&#39;s what&#39;s under the hood that  makes the Focus 3 special. It&#39;s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR 2 chip, similar to the Quest 2, but it&#39;s also running at a higher clock speed. (To get faster and more consistent performance, HTC Vive also squeezed in a heat pipe and cooling fan at the front of the headset.) The Focus 3&#39;s displays offer  5K resolution (4,896 by 2,448 pixels), a smooth 90Hz refresh rate and a wide 120-degree field of view. In comparison, the Quest 2&#39;s screen is close to 4K and has an estimated 90- to 100-degree field of view (depending on where you position the lenses). Both headsets offer LCDs with RGB sub-pixels, which offers a boost in sharpness and clarity compared to PenTile OLED screens from earlier models.</p><section data-eng-breakout="51c9a03763514f32af2d865c6712fcc8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf51-e4bd-11eb-a7f7-6ee800969b6e" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3"></section><p>As far as VR technology goes, the Focus 3 has just about everything you&#39;d want in a modern headset. But there are simple, less technical upgrades that I appreciated too, like its support for large 150mm-wide glasses. It usually takes a bit of effort for me to squeeze a headset over my frames, and they inevitably get yanked out whenever I step out of VR. But I never had to deal with that on the Focus 3, thanks to its roomy interior. There&#39;s also an IPD adjustment dial to help you fine-tune exactly how its lenses hit your eyes; the Quest 2 only gives you a few options to adjust IPD. The elaborate padding around the front and rear also goes a long way toward making you forget you&#39;re even wearing a VR headset.</p><p>Even the Focus 3&#39;s controllers are better than anything we&#39;ve seen from HTC Vive before. They look similar to Oculus&#39;s, with a round tracking ring, face buttons, as well as the standard grip and trigger buttons. Clearly, they&#39;re light years beyond the enormous controllers that the original HTC Vive came with. Still, Oculus has the edge when it comes to overall ergonomics. The Quest 2&#39;s gamepads are contoured to better fit your hands, especially during fast-paced games. Holding the Focus 3&#39;s controllers, meanwhile, feels more awkward during lengthy VR sessions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2877bde0-e4bd-11eb-9b55-e06a17df7af6" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="c1d6ea36-a10d-30ce-bf0a-020b519c5977"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thankfully, though, the headset itself is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and it delivers the most immersive standalone virtual reality experiences I&#39;ve seen yet. I wandered the Louvre in <em>Mona Lisa Beyond the Glass</em>, which let me get inches away from several classic da Vinci paintings. If I tried to do that in real life, I&#39;m sure some security guards would swiftly kick me out. But in VR, I could admire the detail in every work of art. I was also surprised just how great everything looked in the Focus 3. There was more detail than in any Quest 2 experience I&#39;ve seen, and the large field of view genuinely made me feel like I was walking through the Louvre&#39;s ornate halls, instead of just peering in through a pair of VR binoculars.</p><p>Similarly, I had a genuine sense of walking through meadows and tropical beaches in the Nature Treks VR experience. The Focus 3&#39;s sharp display once again shined when I peered at statues and wildlife up close, but the detail was limited by its mobile hardware. 360-degree YouTube videos also looked fantastic when I fired them up in Firefox VR, but the experience can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the source. And even though the headset doesn&#39;t have beefy near-field speakers like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-reverb-g2-review-vr-windows-mixed-reality-130012057.html">HP Reverb G2</a> .</p><p>I was surprised that the Focus 3 didn&#39;t include any sort of built-in multimedia app for watching VR videos, but that really underscores one of its biggest problems: The Focus 3 has a far more limited software library than the Quest. While Oculus has pushed for high-profile exclusives and popular games, like <em>Vader Immortal </em>and <em>Beat Saber</em>, the HTC VivePort store feel practically anemic. There are a handful of shared titles across both platforms, like <em>Last Labyrinth </em>and <em>Tokyo Chronos</em>, but it&#39;s clear they aren&#39;t a big focus for HTC Vive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf50-e4bd-11eb-aff7-e549ecbc5902" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="e1dc6f3a-73d9-3135-bf39-46d874ce91a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>At this point, even installing new experiences is more of a pain on the Focus 3, since you need to take off the headset to purchase apps and games from your web browser. Meanwhile, the Quest and Quest 2 let you buy things from within the headset and a mobile app. But I suppose that&#39;s not a huge problem for HTC Vive, since the Focus 3 isn&#39;t meant for consumers at all. Instead, IT departments will likely preload the software their workers actually need. (There&#39;s also going to be a Vive Business App Store eventually, though it&#39;s unclear if that will offer a better purchasing experience.)</p><p>That&#39;s one reason why we&#39;re not scoring this review. This $1,300 headset isn&#39;t meant to be consumer friendly. And honestly, I couldn&#39;t even test some of the more popular business apps, like Vive Sync&#39;s virtual collaboration tool and Engage&#39;s event app. HTC Vive&#39;s previous Focus headsets also gained a reputation for being easy ways to train employees using apps like Virti. And while that app certainly looks cool in the Focus 3, I can&#39;t exactly tell if it&#39;s offering effective training or not.</p><p>There are also features I haven&#39;t been able to effectively test out. The Focus 3 offers Vive Business Streaming, which lets you connect the headset to a VR PC over a USB 3.2 cable or Wi-Fi. But it&#39;s apparently very picky, as none of the USB cables I used were even recognized by the software (and some would just throw an error saying they weren&#39;t USB 3.0 capable, even though I <em>knew</em> they were). You can also stream PC VR over Wi-Fi, but that only works if your computer is connected directly to your router over Ethernet, and if you have a strong wireless connection with the headset. That just wasn&#39;t possible in my basement office. I&#39;m hoping HTC Vive works out its connection requirements, especially since Oculus Link on the Quest is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-link-widens-usb-support-214755370.html">far less demanding when it comes to cables</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf52-e4bd-11eb-9f1e-95f11c8315bd" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="4cc1f931-735c-36f0-aef4-ac30ca6bb200"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>No matter how you cut it, the Quest 2 is still the standalone VR headset most consumers should buy. But the Focus 3 is perfect for businesses looking for something a bit more sturdy and powerful. For them, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,300 device" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">$1,300 device</a> makes more sense than investing tens of thousands on more elaborate training tools.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3f0095e-5d29-4018-a4be-5a62774d660e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626285927</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:05:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook wants the FTC's tech-critic chair to step back from antitrust decisions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon isn&#39;t the only one asking for Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">step away from cases</a>.
