The biggest discount is on the Kindle Paperwhite (ad-supported), Amazon&#39;s waterproof e-reader with a better-contrast display. You can now pick up the 8GB model for $85 (35 percent off the regular $130 price), or $105 for the 32GB model, a savings of $55 or 34 percent.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle Paperwhite 8GB at Amazon - $85" href="https://amzn.to/3BkpXkO">Buy Kindle Paperwhite 8GB at Amazon - $85</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle Paperwhite 32GB at Amazon - $105" href="https://amzn.to/3eDo3lD">Buy Kindle Paperwhite 32GB at Amazon - $105</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest Paperwhite is waterproof with an IPX8 rating, so it can tolerate being immersed in up to two meters of water for as long as an hour — making bathtub or beach reading stress free.

The drawbacks are the lack of MP3 and text-to-speech support, along with a high price — but this sale takes some sting off the latter.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a57b5370-e93a-11eb-8fef-a228ecee935b" style="height:506;width:675;" alt="Amazon is offering up to 35 percent off its Kindle e-readers" data-uuid="f0a9a533-49ec-3c46-82a1-256db864be69"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If it&#39;s a standard Kindle you&#39;re after (above), we have good news there, too.

If you need one for the younger set, you can pick up the Kindle Kids Edition for $70, for a savings of 36 percent or $40.&nbsp;</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle at Amazon - $60" href="https://amzn.to/2UswjxU">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Kindle Kids Edition at Amazon - $70" href="https://amzn.to/3kFwbWr">Buy Kindle Kids Edition at Amazon - $70</a></p><p>The latest Kindle models offer a lot for that price, including an LED-lit screen, weeks of reading time and a touch interface.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/apple-will-postpone-return-to-office-after-covid-19-persists"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant is delaying its return-to-office deadline by about a month and won&#39;t be expecting employees to start working out of its facilities again until October at the earliest. It&#39;s reportedly a response to the recent uptick in coronavirus cases due to the spread of the highly transmissible Delta variant in the US and around the world.</p><p>The tech giant originally wanted to implement a hybrid workplace arrangement starting in September, wherein most employees will be expected to show up at the office for three days a week at a minimum.  &quot;Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate,&quot; Tim Cook reportedly wrote in an internal email.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"><em>The Verge</em></a> reports, staff members tried to push back and sent the company a letter asking it to rethink its &quot;location-flexible work policy&quot; and to embrace remote work for the sake of inclusion and diversity. However,  Apple execs insisted back then that &quot;in-person collaboration is essential to [the company&#39;s] culture and... future.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> notes that Apple is one of the first tech giants is the US to delay its return to office. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-sundar-pichai-hybrid-work-week-plan-225637951.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s adopting a hybrid work week back in May, but it expects 20 percent of its workforce to continue working from home full time. As for Facebook, CEO Mark Zuckerberg previously said that he expects 50 percent of his employees to work from home within the next five to ten years. While Apple doesn&#39;t have a new data for its hybrid workplace implementation, <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> sources said that the company will give employees a month&#39;s notice in advance before they&#39;re expected to go back to work in the office.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-delay-employees-return-to-office-093544574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0faa7486-2de3-42e9-82c7-798777b2f53c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 09:35:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626773513</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T09:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43b5c0b0-e937-11eb-bfef-7247e8383bfc" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43b5c0b0-e937-11eb-bfef-7247e8383bfc" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Emma McIntyre via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - JULY 15: Apple CEO Tim Cook attends Apple's "Ted Lasso" season two premiere at Pacific Design Center on July 15, 2021 in West Hollywood, California.

Now, Peloton is jumping in to the arena with its first fitness game titled &quot;<a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-lanebreak">Lanebreak</a>.&quot; The rhythm-based game is available on the fitness company&#39;s stationary bikes and has a simple setup: Players control a rolling tire on a track by pedalling and switching lanes with the resistance knob in the face of multiple obstacles. This being Peloton, the entire game is synchronized to a music soundtrack. It will all look very familiar to anyone who&#39;s played procedurally-generated music racer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Audiosurf"><em>Audiosurf</em></a>.</p><p><em>Lanebreak</em> is the culmination of months of trials that saw select users playing mini games in two-week pilots. The idea is to export some of the core mechanics of gaming, chiefly rewards and progression, to incentivize Peloton members to exercise more. Music, according to Peloton, acts as the DNA that links its regular exercise classes with its new game in a bid to acclimatize novice players. For now, <em>Lanebreak</em> is still in early access mode with a full launch planned for this winter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The challenge is that there are plenty of fitness gaming rivals in the wild, though few have the brand recognition to match Peloton. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/zwift">Zwift</a>, for instance, offers an app with multiplayer cycling and running in a virtual world that users can interact with using their personal treadmill or bike trainer.

The first-person multiplayer shooter will pit teams of six characters (or Defiants) against each other across several game modes. There’s a focus on gunplay, though you’ll also be able to harness traits, abilities and “ultras” — which seem similar to ultimates in other games — based on the faction you’re using.</p><div id="629855497ccb413e8fa9ad3cc76d53c9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IB0f39NgAkg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>XDefiant</em> is a bit of a crossover between Ubisoft’s various Clancy franchises. The initial set of factions include the Wolves (inspired by Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon), Echelon (Splinter Cell) and the Outcasts and Cleaners (The Division). More Defiants will be added to the game later, and will draw from a variety of characters and abilities “from the Tom Clancy universe … and beyond,” Ubisoft said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft San Francisco is developing <em>XDefant</em>, which the creative leads said features “fast-paced firefights meet punk rock moshpits.” You can customize your Defiant’s loadout (including a primary and secondary weapons, attachments and device). You’ll be able to modify your setup when you respawn to help you adjust to what’s happening in a match. It sounds like there will be ways for both casual and competitive players to get the most out of the game too.</p><div id="6a825db2aade4282ac12a3c2a3e16603"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpM6cLrCs8I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There are clear echoes of <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Valorant</em> here, with plenty Clancyverse flavor thrown in. Executive producer Mark Rubin previously worked on Infinity Ward’s Call of Duty games, and there’s some obvious DNA from that franchise in <em>XDefiant</em> as well.</p><p><em>XDefiant</em> is coming to Xbox One, PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna and Ubisoft Connect with full cross-play expected at the outset. The game’s still fairly early in development, but Ubisoft’s already inviting the public to try it. The first public PC test starts on August 5th, and you can sign up through the <a href="http://www.playxdefiant.com"><em>XDefiant </em>website</a> for a chance to take part.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-tom-clancys-xdefiant-first-person-shooter-free-205135328.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8817d9ea-61b4-4254-9a1c-0b716b629254</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:51:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626727898</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T20:52:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95a80430-e8d0-11eb-bbbd-44701f3e697d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95a80430-e8d0-11eb-bbbd-44701f3e697d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's XDefiant]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's XDefiant]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple rolls out iOS 14.7 with MagSafe Battery Pack support for iPhone 12]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, everyone with a compatible iPhone can update their device to iOS 14.7.

That doesn&#39;t quite seem to be the case.

Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-fifa-ultimate-team-net-revenue-2021-loot-boxes-143258804.html">EA made $1.62 billion</a> from Ultimate Team, which accounted for 29 percent of its net revenue for the fiscal year. &quot;A substantial portion&quot; of that revenue came from FIFA games.</p><p>Meanwhile, FUT packs and other loot boxes have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-08-ftc-loot-boxes-investigation-public-workshop.html">drawn scrutiny</a> from regulators in recent years. Since gamers can&#39;t see which soccer players they&#39;ll unlock when they buy a pack, some authorities have described the packs as a form of gambling. Belgium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-25-loot-crates-illegal-in-belgium.html">banned</a> that type of game mechanic in 2018.

The company is more than doubling the number of service areas this week to north of 400 cities and towns. It now serves several major markets through the Uber and Uber Eats apps, including San Francisco, New York City and Washington DC.</p><p>The rapid expansion was partly fueled by a partnership with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-maps-covid-19-vaccines-pharmacies-160024114.html">Albertsons Companies</a> and its 1,200 grocery stores across the country. Albertsons owns brands including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Acme, Tom Thumb and Randalls. Uber also offers delivery from regional chains such as Southeastern Grocers and New York’s Red Apple Group. Uber Pass and Eats Pass subscribers don&#39;t need to pay delivery fees on grocery orders over $30.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Grocery delivery became an important component of Uber&#39;s business during the toughest parts of the COVID-19 pandemic, because the number of rides people were taking dropped significantly. The company is also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-lyft-surge-pricing-lack-of-drivers-035835230.html">dealing with a driver shortage</a> that led to higher prices for rides.

It also caused a lot of confusion over what would happen to the Android TV operating system, which powers hundreds of models of streaming sticks, TV sets and more. Those older devices didn&#39;t get the new Google TV interface, but the company did begin to roll out some updates that made Android TV look more similar to the new layout, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-interface-discover-tab-170002365.html">refreshed appearance and a Discover tab</a>. Today, Google is adding new tools to Android TV to make it feel more like Google TV: Watchlist, recommendation tuning and detail pages.</p><p>With this update, you can now add titles to your watchlist across the Android TV system, either by long-pressing on your selection and hitting &quot;Add to Watchlist&quot; or pressing the Watchlist option in the show&#39;s detail page. You can also add to the list from your phone or laptop via Google Search or in the TV app. Your saved items will appear in a row on the Discover tab.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also tweaked the detail pages of each show by adding trailers that autoplay when you dive deeper into each title, similar to how services like Netflix are set up. You can turn these off in the Settings (under Home Screen in Device Preferences  by deactivating &quot;Enable video previews&quot;).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e05d2a80-e6c5-11eb-bfba-ac66682cbbf0" style="height:527;width:937;" alt="An image showing the new Android TV Tune Your Recommendations feature.

Additionally, there&#39;s a card in the Discover tab that says &quot;Improve your recommendations&quot; that will let you tune your preferences too, and you can choose between &quot;More like this&quot; or &quot;Less like this&quot; for each show.

The network has <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/">unveiled</a> a CNN+ service that will offer a blend of live and on-demand shows that are &quot;separate and distinct&quot; from existing TV coverage. It will debut sometime in the first quarter of 2022. CNN hasn&#39;t narrowed down the price, but lead executive Andrew Morse told <em>Variety</em> in an <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/">interview</a> that there wouldn&#39;t be an ad-supported tier at launch.</p><p>The centerpiece, as you&#39;d expect, will be the live material. CNN+ plans to offer eight to 12 hours of in-depth topical coverage and &quot;lifestyle&quot; material every day, with both veterans and newcomers at the helm. You&#39;ll also have chances to interact with anchors and experts in real-time discussions. This won&#39;t be a digital replica of CNN&#39;s usual news, then, but you may have reasons to tune in every day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The on-demand catalog unsurprisingly taps into CNN&#39;s existing collection, including shows like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> and <em>United Shades of America</em>. There will be original shows and movies for the internet service, although CNN+ won&#39;t reveal those until later in 2021.</p><p>Officially, Morse said CNN+ wouldn&#39;t be bundled or otherwise tie into HBO Max despite the WarnerMedia connection. <em>Variety</em> sources, however, claimed there was a &quot;strong probability&quot; the service would be bundled with HBO Max and Discovery+ after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">WarnerMedia and Discovery</a> finalize their merger.</p><p>Morse considered the CNN+ launch the largest the network has had since it started TV service in June 1980. It was also a chance to experiment with formats that blur distinctions between entertainment and news, the executive added.</p><p>The question, of course, is whether or not viewers will bite. CNN has had success with long-form content like the late Anthony Bourdain&#39;s shows, but it&#39;s not clear if people are ready to pay a monthly fee to see them. There&#39;s also the matter of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-please-stop-making-streaming-services.html">streaming service overload</a> — you might not be thrilled to subscribe to yet another offering just to be sure you catch everything CNN has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cnn-plus-streaming-service-launch-153702038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b42bb611-7e1e-4966-a69a-6ca3ae388f30</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:37:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626709026</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:37:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dish will pay AT&T $5 billion to serve its mobile customers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/at&amp;t"><ins>AT&amp;T</ins></a> is set to provide voice, data and messaging services to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dish%20network"><ins>Dish</ins></a>&#39;s Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless customers for the next 10 years.

Prop up your phone, stand 10 feet away and you can walk through a familiar &quot;can you read this&quot; test that will gauge whether or not your glasses or contacts need updating.</p><p>The update isn&#39;t automatic. An eye doctor will review the results and give you a verdict within two days. If you&#39;re seeing well enough, you&#39;ll just need to pay $15 to renew your prescription. If you&#39;re either struggling or just aren&#39;t eligible to use the app (see below), Warby Parker will recommend that you get a thorough eye exam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is clear that this isn&#39;t a replacement for your eye doctor, and that you&#39;ll have to meet certain criteria beyond what we just mentioned. You have to be between 18 and 65 years old, with no existing eye health concerns and a single-vision distance prescription.</p><p>The approach relies on iOS&#39; Vision Framework to measure your distance from your iPhone and ensure that you&#39;re far enough away from a proper test. We&#39;ve asked Warby Parker about an Android version, although that might take a while given that it would need a rough equivalent to Vision Framework.</p><p>The motivations behind Virtual Vision Test are clear — on top of the renewal fee, this could lead to more people buying Warby Parker glasses and visiting the company&#39;s stores. Regardless, it could be very useful if you either can&#39;t make time to update your prescription or are still skittish about a visit while COVID-19 remains a concern.</p><div id="69f7067959d24c01ac391727048578e4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warby-parker-virtual-vision-test-app-150052775.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6bf0d22d-d6a2-44d7-88b4-3f74ce2a8a6a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626707495</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:11:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eye Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warby Parker]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gadgets for students under $50]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The little things can get you when you’re in college. You arrive on campus, fresh and ready to go, but before you know it, you’re a few weeks into the new semester and you have a long list of small things you forgot to pack and need to buy ASAP. We at Engadget also know from experience that there are unassuming gadgets that can make your collegiate life easier. To help you get ahead of the game, we’ve compiled the best items under $50 so you can get the most crucial ones off your list before you even set foot on campus.</p><h2>Anker PowerExtend Cube USB-C power strip</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a111c41-df36-11eb-b6fd-1b0b78f3f641" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Basic two-receptacle wall outlets just don’t cut it anymore now that we all have a small army of devices that we rely on every day.

This cube has two USB-A ports, one 30W USB-C socket and three AC outlets, giving you more ways to keep your laptop, phone, tablet, headphones and other devices charged up. The five-foot cable is another perk as it prevents you from needing to hug the wall of the library in order to get things done. Also, it weighs just 9.2 ounces so you can bring it with you whenever you need your own personal charging station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy PowerExtend strip at Amazon - $40" href="https://amzn.to/3htSgnw">Buy PowerExtend strip at Amazon - $40</a></p><h2>Incase Bionic accessories organizer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a077f53-df36-11eb-b7ed-ebe176fffb42" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Staying organized is key to staying sane while in school, and that’s true for both your digital and physical essentials. For the latter, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Incase&#x002019;s Bionic Accessory Organizer" href="https://fave.co/3waxXRA">Incase’s Bionic Accessory Organizer</a> is just the right size to act as both a pencil case and an “everything else” holder. It has a number of pen loops inside for those that prefer to take handwritten notes, but it also has a bunch of variously sized pockets that can easily hold things like your portable hard drive, an extra phone charger and even a compact wireless mouse. And, unlike those cheap pencil cases you’ll find at the dollar store, this one’s made of ocean-recycled material that’s equivalent to seven plastic bottles.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Bionic accessory organizer at Incase - $50" href="https://fave.co/3waxXRA">Buy Bionic accessory organizer at Incase - $50</a></p><h2>Lention 4-in-1 USB-C hub</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a06bc01-df36-11eb-87df-e5193e919762" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Your brand new laptop might be blazing fast and super lightweight, but it probably doesn&#39;t have as many ports as you&#39;d like. Such is the trade-off companies make when creating powerful thin-and-light machines, leaving us stuck living the dongle life. But it doesn’t have to be so painful if you get the right adapter for your laptop. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Lention&#x002019;s 4-in-1 USB-C hub" href="https://amzn.to/3AiPGtc">Lention’s 4-in-1 USB-C hub</a> is a great option for students. It’s compact, measuring 3 x 1.4 inches, and it includes three USB-A ports and one USB-C connection. That should let you connect accessories like mice and keyboards, and even access files on a thumb drive when you’re working on a group project. The USB-C port is for charging only, but that’s not necessarily a downside — you can use it with your laptop’s power adapter and USB-C cable to power your machine while using the adapter at the same time.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lention 4-in-1 hub at Amazon - $20" href="https://amzn.to/3AiPGtc">Buy Lention 4-in-1 hub at Amazon - $20</a></p><h2>Anker PowerLine II USB-C to Lightning cable (10-foot)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a06bc00-df36-11eb-bd4f-951d018715c5" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>When you&#39;re a student, there’s nothing worse than realizing your iPhone is down to 2 percent battery when you’re in the middle of submitting an assignment online. The charging cable that came with your phone has probably served you well, but having a second, longer cable can allow you to power up in dire situations even when the closest outlet is across the room. We’ve been fans of Anker’s Powerline series for a long time, and this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:10-foot USB-C to Lightning cable" href="https://amzn.to/3yebGnj">10-foot USB-C to Lightning cable</a> is worth investing in. Not only is it MFi-certified so it will work well with all Apple devices, but its length gives you much more flexibility than your standard three-foot cable does. It also supports fast charging if you have an appropriately powerful adapter to use it with. And for those who don’t have iPhones, Anker has a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:10-foot USB-C to C cable" href="https://amzn.to/3kypipV">10-foot USB-C to C cable</a> that should serve your handsets well, too.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cable at Amazon - $23" href="https://amzn.to/3yebGnj">Buy Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cable at Amazon - $23</a></p><h2>Apple AirTag</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a077f50-df36-11eb-be9f-94070a5becd9" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We’re all familiar with the panic that ensues when you realize you’ve misplaced your keys, wallet, phone or other valuables.

Like most Apple accessories, setting up AirTags is as easy as placing them in close proximity to your iPhone and figuring out how you want to attach them to your belongings (and you <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:don&#x002019;t have to shell out a lot of money" href="https://amzn.to/3zvMASp">don’t have to shell out a lot of money</a> for fancy key rings to do so). After that, if you do lose your stuff, you can use your phone to force the AirTag to emit a loud chime. And if you’re still within Bluetooth range, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">Apple’s Precision Finding feature</a> can literally guide you back to your belongings.

It works with laptops, tablets and smartphones, and it even has a companion app that can automatically backup your files so you always have the most up-to-date version on hand.

Students will like the fact that it won&#39;t take up much space on their desks and they can ask Alexa to play music from Spotify, Apple Music and others whenever they want to have an impromptu dorm-room dance party. And, since it plugs into a wall outlet, they never have to remember to charge the Echo Dot like they would with a portable speaker. What&#39;s more, when an assignment stumps them, students can consult Alexa for help. Are we suggesting they ask Alexa for the answers to all their homework conundrums? Not exactly.

The White House has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/">declared</a> &quot;with a high degree of confidence&quot; that hackers linked to China&#39;s Ministry of State Security (MSS) were responsible for a digital espionage campaign using the Exchange vulnerabilities. Officials have confronted senior Chinese leadership with this and &quot;broader&quot; hostile online activity, the White House said.</p><p>The US further accused China of running an intelligence operation that relied on &quot;contract hackers&quot; who frequently launched attacks meant solely for profit, such as ransomware schemes and crypto jacking. The Chinese government&#39;s reported unwillingness to tackle these abuses is believed to hurt businesses, governments and infrastructure with &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in damage, the White House said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the Justice Department has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">revealed</a> indictments of four MSS-affiliated Chinese men for allegedly conducting an extended hacking campaign meant to steal intellectual property and trade secrets, including health research. The initiative, which ran between 2011 and 2018, reportedly saw Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, Zhu Yunmin and Wu Shurong compromise comptuers worldwide to grab information ranging from autonomous vehicle technology and chemical formulas through to research on Ebola, AIDS and other diseases.</p><p>Biden&#39;s administration has already taken multiple actions in response to attacks, including &quot;proactive network defense actions&quot; like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-hafnium-exchange-server-060721872.html">deleting backdoors</a> on compromised Exchange servers. It added private companies to its Unified Coordination Group to bolster its security incident response. CISA, the FBI and the NSA also released an advisory outlining China&#39;s strategy for compromising US and ally networks using the Exchange holes and other methods.</p><p>This comes on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dhs-tsa-cybersecurity-rules-pipeline-companies-colonial-pipeline-164141100.html">stricter security rules</a> for pipeline companies as well as a pilot to tackle vulnerabilities in sectors like electricity and water supply.</p><p>China has historically denied involvement in attacks like these, and it&#39;s doubtful the country will have a change of heart after this. The White House effort is more of a warning — the US will not only pin attacks on China, but respond to them in kind.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/white-house-blames-china-for-exchange-cyberattacks-132053693.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8552d474-22be-4f33-906d-24fe2f2f25c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:20:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626700856</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:21:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35121f0-e88d-11eb-bfff-2ae41ba058e5" width="7076" height="4717" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WANG ZHAO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chinese honour guards prepare for celebrations in Beijing on July 1, 2021, to mark the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

They found that the average artwork observation time is just four to five seconds, with very few pieces capturing visitors&#39; attention for longer than 15 seconds. They add that if mask restrictions are dropped, the system will be able to track facial observations without compromising privacy, allowing the team to monitor cognitive reactions, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The ShareArt tool is the latest example of art melding with technology.

Whether you’re heading to a physical campus, taking classes online or a mix of both, a laptop is sure to be the control center for your studies.</p><p>And things have changed quite a bit over the last year or so. We’ve seen the introduction of Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks, while Microsoft recently unveiled Windows 11. With ARM-based computers teasing a future where the line between mobile and desktop computing is blurry, and Windows 11 working to bridge that gap by supporting Android apps, the laptop market is the most exciting it’s been in years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But that might lead to more questions for shoppers. What should you look out for if you want an ARM-based PC? Will they run Windows 11 when that update is available? What are some key specs you should add to your must-have list this year? We compiled this guide to help you make the right choice, alongside a list of this year’s best laptops.</p><h2>What to look for in a laptop for school (and what to avoid)</h2><p>First: Windows on ARM still isn’t worth it. Snapdragon laptops may look and feel sleek, offer excellent battery life and built-in cellular radios, but they’re typically quite expensive, especially considering their limited app compatibility and finicky software. Apple’s M1 MacBooks, on the other hand, are great for almost everyone, barring those who need external GPUs, niche software or more than 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Over on the Intel side of things, almost every notebook released this year packs an 11th-generation Core processor. You’ll likely be able to find a cheaper version of a product with a 10th-gen chip, and it should still serve you well. And don’t forget about AMD’s Ryzen chips, either — they’re plenty powerful and no longer just for the bargain bin. If you&#39;re eagerly awaiting the arrival of Windows 11 devices, don&#39;t expect to see them before the semester begins. They&#39;re more likely to show up in the fall around Microsoft&#39;s usual hardware event in October.</p><p>Across the industry, companies have shifted to taller aspect ratios for their screens. Surface Laptops sport 3:2 panels, while many Dell and HP models offer 16:10. While the older 16:9 format is nice for watching videos, you’ll probably appreciate a taller format when you’re writing an essay. Some devices, like Dell’s XPS and Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro, come with OLED panels, which will be nice for working with photos and videos. They usually cost more and take a toll on battery life, though, so you’ll need to weigh your priorities.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a diverse selection of laptops around, so you should be able to find a suitable one regardless of your preferences. Here are our favorite notebooks for your return to schoolwork.</p><h2><strong>Apple MacBook Air M1</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37c97a60-df2f-11eb-9ecb-f6cb740aca90" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With its speedy performance, slim fanless design and excellent battery life, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">MacBook Air M1</a> is a no-brainer for any Apple user. You’ll appreciate familiar features like a Retina display, comfortable keyboard and reliable trackpad. Plus, thanks to the company’s excellent Rosetta 2 emulator software, you won’t notice a huge performance difference when relying on Intel apps.</p><p>The big news, though, is that the ARM-based M1 allows the laptop to run iPhone and iPad apps too. While not every app will be available on macOS, the potential for more options on your desktop here is great. Now you just have to make sure you can keep the distractions at bay — which should be easy with the upcoming Focus modes on macOS Monterey, arriving in its final form later this year.</p><p>Unfortunately for those looking for more internal storage or something to run their bespoke video streaming setup, pre-fab <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> laptops top out at 512GB storage (although you can pay extra for up to 2TB) while the Pro M1 only supports up to 16GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro M1 also lacks support for multiple monitors and an external GPU. Those with more demanding workflows might need to look to Windows or an Intel-powered MacBook to ensure app compatibility.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Dell XPS 13</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53f7ae50-df2f-11eb-abef-05df19e0597f" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Dell’s XPS series has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">an Engadget favorite for years</a>. Despite a somewhat plain design that some might call “classic,” the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">XPS 13</a> still stands out for nailing pretty much everything that matters. Great performance? Check. Gorgeous screen? Yes. Comfortable keyboard? Yep. Throw in a long-lasting battery and a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-laptops-11th-gen-intel-cpus-130009045.html">the latest versions</a>, and you’ve got a powerful workhorse for all your classes (and more).</p><p>The company shifted to a 16:10 aspect ratio in 2020, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">recently added a 4K OLED option</a>. That means you’ll see greater contrast ratios and deeper blacks for maximum display goodness. The OLED configuration will cost you $300 more than the Full HD LCD option, but those who want the best viewing experience may not mind the premium. We also recommend you spend a little more and get at least the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM" href="https://bit.ly/3ywh0CO">Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM</a> instead of the meager 4GB that the base model offers.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930</a></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e0b8dc0-df2f-11eb-bbe7-52280094a124" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for an excellent typing experience, look no further than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop 4" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Surface Laptop 4</a>. Microsoft has been killing it with its recent Surface Laptops keyboards,  and this one is no exception. Though they’re not as deep and springy as ThinkPads, the buttons here are super responsive and offer ample travel. The roomy trackpad is solid, too.</p><p>Of course, it’s important that the Surface Laptop 4 deliver on everything else, or we wouldn’t recommend it. The 15-inch version <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-4-review-2021-bigger-better-ultraportable-133047360.html">that we tested</a> offered breezy performance, respectable battery life and a lovely 3:2 Pixelsense screen that supports Microsoft’s Surface Pen input. Though its design is a little staid, the Surface Laptop 4 still has a clean, professional look and a luxurious aluminum case that&#39;s sturdy enough to withstand being stuffed in your backpack on the regular. Plus, at 3.4 pounds, it won&#39;t burden your shoulders much.</p><p>The best thing about the Surface Laptop 4 is that the base model, which comes equipped with AMD’s Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of RAM, starts at $1,000. That rivals the Dell XPS 13, making it a better buy for the value conscious; you get more screen, more power and more RAM for the money. Both the Surface and the XPS are great options, but the latter offers an OLED panel and thinner bezels that make it look more modern.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8391a7b0-df2f-11eb-9fdf-c928301f5bd2" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For those whose priority is a lightweight design, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Book Pro" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Galaxy Book Pro</a> series should be at the top of your list. At just 2.36 pounds for the clamshell and 3.06 pounds for the convertible model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review-price-specs-130006444.html">15-inch Galaxy Book Pro</a> is one of the lightest 15-inch laptops around. It’s also super thin at 0.46 inches thick, and despite its compact size it manages to house three USB-C ports (one of them supporting Thunderbolt 4), a microSD card reader and a headphone jack.</p><p>It also packs an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor and at least 8GB of RAM, along with a 68Whr battery that delivers a similar runtime to the Dell XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4. That’s particularly impressive given the Galaxy Book Pro has a Super AMOLED screen, which offers sumptuous image quality, high contrast ratio and deep blacks. Unfortunately, Samsung is still stuck on a 16:9 screen format, which will feel outdated in a year or two, but is hardly a dealbreaker.</p><p>The Galaxy Book Pro’s keyboard isn’t as comfortable as the Surface Laptop 4’s but it’s pleasant enough, and the trackpad is enormous. We’re more concerned about the odd webcam software that makes you look dark and splotchy, so if looking your best on video calls is of concern you might want to consider something else. Plus, the $1,100 base model comes with an Intel Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, making it a competitive offering against the Dell and Surface laptops. Awful camera aside, there’s plenty to love about the Galaxy Book Pro, especially for those looking to lighten their loads.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999</a></p><h2>Acer Chromebook Spin 713</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f3731fb0-df2e-11eb-997e-b8fa781ff86f" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re considering saving a few hundred bucks by opting for Chrome OS, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer Chromebook Spin 713" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWzeYv">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a> might be the right choice.

Yes, that’s less memory than anything else on this list, but it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">costs much less</a> than any of our non-Chromebook suggestions.</p><p>There’s plenty of ports here — including an Ethernet socket — and the aluminum chassis should make this laptop feel more expensive than it is. You’ll also appreciate its reliable performance, comfortable keyboard and 1080p display. For the price, the Aspire 5 offers everything you need to get through the school day, making it a great bargain.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Aspire 5 at Acer starting at $399" href="https://fave.co/36hK70i">Buy Aspire 5 at Acer starting at $399</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0033e2b5-610e-3f15-9d56-aa74b5d388e3</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:06:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626722767</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T19:26:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[Dell]]></category><category><![CDATA[xps13]]></category><category><![CDATA[galaxybookflex]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[MacBookAir]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></category><category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[bts2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[surfacego2]]></category><category><![CDATA[SurfaceLaptop3]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7e73d400-df2b-11eb-8b7d-224d93864217" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7e73d400-df2b-11eb-8b7d-224d93864217" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Three laptops against a bright colorful background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Laptops - Back to School ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA shows 'Wolfenstein: Youngblood' with RTX ray-tracing on ARM]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mediatek-arm-pcs-gpus-170021586.html">recently said</a> that it was working with MediaTek to bring RTX graphics to ARM-based laptops, and now it has shown what that might look like for gamers. At the Game Developers Conference (GDC), it <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/">unveiled</a> a technical demo with an RTX-powered MediaTek ARM processor running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-wolfenstein-youngblood-e3-demo-video.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>NVIDIA showed off real time ray-traced reflections and DLSS on the game using an ARM-based platform for the first time. It also showed off a demo called <em>Bistro</em> (from Amazon&#39;s Lumberyard game engine) running real-time ray-tracing on ARM, with RTX direct illumination (RTXDI) and NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser (NRD) features turned on. The demos ran on a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 ARM-based platform combined with a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c9dc21c047b40eeb74ffd727199a46f"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBfci5hYN1c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA made the tech work by porting several RTX SDKs to ARM devices. Those include deep learning super sampling (DLSS) to boost sharpness, RTX direct illumination, NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser, the RTX memory utility (RTXMU) and RTX global illumination. NVIDIA said that the RTXDI, NRD and RTXMU SDKs for ARM with Linux are now available for developers, with RTXGI and DLSS coming soon.</p><p>Of course, you won&#39;t get to see any of this until manufacturers add RTX hardware to their ARM-based laptops, Chromebooks or other devices. Game manufacturers will also need to implement the tech for ARM-based games. However, both the <em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em> developer and game engine company seem bullish.&nbsp;</p><p>“RTX support for ARM and Linux opens up new opportunities for game developers to provide more immersive experiences on a wider variety of platforms,” said Unity&#39;s senior technical product manager Mathieu Muller. &quot;An iD Tech-based game running on an ARM CPU with ray tracing enabled is a significant step in a journey that will result in many more gaming platforms being available to all game developers,&quot; added Machinegames CTO Jim Kjellin.</p><p>Of course, NVIDIA&#39;s relationship with ARM is set to get a whole lot closer as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-arm-acquisition-softbank-000846113.html">bought the company</a> last year for $40 billion. However, the deal is subject to regulatory approval and NVIDIA rival (and ARM customer) Qualcomm has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">objected</a> to the deal. On top of that, ARM employees 3,000 people in the UK and that country&#39;s regulator is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-cma-investigating-nvidia-arm-acquisition-130504069.html">investigating</a> the sale.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-shows-wolfenstein-youngblood-running-rtx-ray-tracing-on-arm-130037247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c1b8331-66aa-43d0-83f7-db4b277ce035</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626701816</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T13:37:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/45898170-e896-11eb-bf5d-aed68cf5f282" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An onscreen example of NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's  Wolfenstein: Youngblood ray tracing.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Klipsch's newest soundbars offer 8K HDR passthrough and Dolby Atmos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Klipsch has a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-klipsch-soundbars-at-ces-2020.html">futureproof soundbars</a>, and that&#39;s certainly true of its latest models. The audio veteran has launched four new soundbars headlined by the tech-friendly <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/cinema-1200-sound-bar-and-surround-system">Cinema 1200</a> (above) and <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/cinema-800-sound-bar">Cinema 800</a> (below).

You&#39;ll get a pair of extra HDMI inputs on each bar to help your home theater expand, too.</p><p>The differences, as you might expect, come down to raw power. The Cinema 1200 spreads its namesake 1,200W of power across a 5.1.4-channel system with a 12-inch wireless subwoofer, while the Cinema 800  is a simpler 3.1-channel rig with a 10-inch wireless sub.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/a37811b0-d8d9-11eb-97ef-3e38b1a798a8" alt="Klipsch Cinema 800 Sound Bar" data-uuid="9736975a-a2f7-33a7-b8a4-169bbe99ca2d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Klipsch</div></figure><p>Both sound bars are available now, with the Cinema 1200 selling for $1,699 and the 800 going for a more modest $879 price.</p><p>There are a pair of options for modest setups and smaller TVs.

Sound quality is noticeably better than previous AirPods models, thanks in part to a built-in amplifier and  Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-range frequencies to your ears. Active noise-cancellation does a good job blocking out surrounding sounds and the earbuds&#39; touch controls let you quickly enter Transparency Mode whenever you need to hear the world around you.</p><p>But the AirPods Pro carved out a spot on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">our favorite wireless earbuds</a> list because of how easy they are to use with other Apple products. The H1 chip inside allows them to pair and switch easily between iPhones, iPads and Macs, so you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac pretty seamlessly. We also like their hands-free Siri feature, which lets you call upon the voice assistant without tapping the earbuds.</p><p>AirPods Pro are one of the best pairs of earbuds you can get if you live in the Apple ecosystem — but there are other options, too.
