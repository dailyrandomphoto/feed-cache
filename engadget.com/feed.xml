The company told Sparked users the experiment will shut down on January 20th.</p><p>“We started building Sparked in late 2020 to help people find love through an experience rooted in kindness. Since then, thanks to regular input and feedback from you, we improved where we could, learned a ton, and made connections between people,” Facebook wrote in the email, which <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/13/meta-shuts-down-its-experimental-video-speed-dating-service-sparked/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> obtained. “Like many good ideas, some take off and others, like Sparked, must come to an end.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Users will be able to download their data before January 20th. After that date, Facebook will wipe their Sparked accounts.</p><p>Sparked was a blend of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chatroulette/">Chatroulette</a>, the video chats other dating apps have introduced over the last few years and a speed dating event. At a predetermined time, users from a certain area or demographic would take part in dating events (there were a few global events too). They&#39;d have four minutes to chat with a potential match, and if they both wanted to spend more time with each other, they could set up a second, 10-minute date and/or exchange contact details.</p><p>Although users needed a Facebook account to use Sparked, the service was distinct from both Facebook and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook%20dating/">Facebook Dating</a>. It had no public profiles, messaging or matching features, like swiping on Tinder.</p><p>Facebook initially described Sparked as a small beta test to learn about video dating, so it might not truly have intended for the service to blow up in popularity. Both Sparked and Facebook Dating added audio chat features last year.</p><p>Sparked is joining a long list of NPE projects that Facebook has shut down, including Pinterest-style app for hobbyists <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-shutting-down-hobbi-041407194.html">Hobbi</a>, TikTok clone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-shuts-down-lasso-july-10th-120501011.html">Lasso</a> and selfie app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-13-facebook-will-shut-down-msqrd-selfie-app.html">MSQRD</a>.

What was once the reserve of audiophiles is slowly becoming a go-to gadget for those who want more than what their phone and AirPods can deliver. But they’re not without caveats. For one, they’re often expensive, and sometimes they aren’t much smaller than the phone you’re attaching them to. Enter the <a href="https://www.khadas.com/tea">Tea DAC by Khadas</a>.</p><p>Khadas started out making media-friendly single board computers (SBC - think… media-specific Raspberry Pi type things) before moving on to desktop DACs. Tea is the company’s first mobile DAC and it appears to be primarily targeted at iPhone users – though it’s also compatible with Android. The reason I suggest it’s more apt for Apple’s phones is that it’s MagSafe compatible. Combine that with the slim, iPhone-esque all-metal design and it solves one of the main problems with mobile DACs: Having something heavy hanging out the back of your phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the Tea, it sticks to the back of your phone and the low profile makes it only a little more noticeable than Apple’s own MagSafe wallets. You can, of course, find MagSafe capable cases for Android, but your phone and budget will be a factor.</p><p>Beyond the slick form factor, the Tea doesn’t scrimp on its codec support. Over USB/Lightning, the Tea can handle audio right up to 32bit/384kHz. Given that most mainstream music services don’t offer anything above 192kHz, streamers will be more than covered. Similarly, the Tea can decode MQA (Tidal) along with DSD, AAC, FLAC, APE, OGG and all the standard formats (WAV/MP3 etc.). If you prefer to go wireless, the Tea also supports LDAC and AptX HD over Bluetooth.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9b8f1f40-7495-11ec-bdf7-357e3f6165a5" alt="Tea is a mobile DAC for streaming lossless audio to your phone." data-uuid="d0791b85-3229-34e6-a30c-bfe0014a5b44"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Here I should mention that, for all its iPhone friendliness, Apple doesn’t offer either LDAC or AptX HD support in its flagship phones. You can still use the Bluetooth functionality in Tea, but you won’t be able to enjoy the higher-quality formats. Though it does at least mean you can charge your phone while still using the DAC or you can wander around with the smaller Tea connected to your headphones rather than your mobile. There are plenty of Android phones that <em>do</em> support LDAC/AptX HD, but you’ll need to check the manufacturer website to confirm (most Pixels, Samsung flagships and OnePlus phones offer LDAC/AptX HD decoding).</p><p>There are a few things you won’t find here, but most of those fall into the higher end of audio. For example, there’s only a regular 3.5mm headphone jack – no option for 2.5 or 4.4mm balanced cans at this point (though rumor has it that a “Pro” version with that might be on the way). There’s also limited feedback about what codec/audio quality you’re currently receiving, with just a simple color-changing LED indicating the format, which you can’t see unless the phone is face down. Inputs are limited to USB-C, so it’ll work with your phone and PC, but no line in.</p><p>This puts the Tea in an interesting category. It’s perfectly capable for people that want the most out of their streaming service and even should appeal to audiophiles looking for a discreet option that covers most bases. But at $199 it’s a reasonable spend. Perhaps its most obvious competitor is the BTR5 from Fiio. That’s also a portable DAC with high-res Bluetooth support along with a similar selection of cabled formats (also up to 32bit/384kHz with MQA support). Oh, and the Fiio offers a balanced headphone option, too (2.5mm). When you factor in that the BTR5 also typically retails for $159, you have to really want that slim, MagSafe design.</p><p>That’s not to undersell it though. I tested the BTR5 and the Tea side by side, and the sheer convenience of the Tea was obvious. With the Fiio, your phone feels tethered, almost weighed down by the DAC. With the Tea, it’s similar to using one of those iPhone cases with a battery in it – a little more thickness, but you can still operate the phone as you normally would.</p><p>The Tea also has a much bigger battery capacity – 1,160 mAh compared to the Fiio’s 550 mAh. This obviously isn’t an audio benefit, but it soon becomes one if you plan on listening for extended periods or being away from a charging option for more than a few hours. Which, given the mobile nature of these devices feels like a reasonable possibility.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9b2c8c0-7495-11ec-aeaf-6180f65a0d8c" alt="Tea mobile DAC connected to an iPhone." data-uuid="0aac999e-41d7-3ec3-95b0-26b7a9f38ca9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>I am, however, not a huge fan of the user interface. The Tea has three buttons: One on the left and two on the right. The single button works as a power switch or to summon your virtual assistant. The two buttons on the other side will either control volume or skip tracks. You toggle between volume and skip mode with a dual press of the power button and the top button on the other side. It works… fine, but it’s not very elegant. Also, if you leave it in track skip mode and go to adjust the volume, you’re going to be on the next track before you know it. A minor, but frustrating thing.</p><p>In wired mode, the Tea pumps out robust, loud, clear audio. It’s maybe not quite as loud as some other DACs. Even the diminutive Firefly gives the Tea a run for its money there. But, the sound you do get is clean and full of gain, and that’s the goal here: Take a good signal and let it be heard without colorization.</p><p>Beyond its primary function as a DAC, it also won’t get in the way of taking calls. A pair of mics on the base of the Tea allow you to talk without having to fall back to the mic on your phone. What’s more, the mics on the Tea are several leagues better than the one on the iPhone, especially when speaking to it while it’s resting on the desk. You can also set the Tea to charge via your phone if you’re running low on juice, or disable this feature to not tax the battery on your handset if you prefer.</p><p>All in all, the Tea is a welcome addition to a growing category. At $199 it’s not the cheapest for the feature set, but its well-thought-out design and aesthetic also make it pretty convenient and discreet. Unfortunately, if this all sounds up your alley, then you’ll have to wait a little longer. While Khadas clearly is production-ready, the company is choosing to go the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tea-ultraslim-hi-res-headphone-amplifier/coming_soon">Indiegogo route</a>, with the campaign slated to go live in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/khadas-tea-dac-magsafe-143001002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">743c2a0a-731f-471e-a697-31793445b909</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:30:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642158791</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T11:13:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db243450-73c4-11ec-bdbc-f1170c2f6472" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db243450-73c4-11ec-bdbc-f1170c2f6472" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Tea" is a MagSafe compatible DAC perfect for iPhones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tea MagSafe DAC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review: Checking a lot boxes for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I review <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html"><em>a lot</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>of true wireless earbuds, so I’m always curious what the next trends will be when companies offer their annual refresh for new products. Over the last few years, smaller sizes, better battery life and hands-free features have become the norm, but there’s only so much you can do on such a tiny device.</p><p>In 2021, Jabra set the new standard for affordable wireless earbuds with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>the Elite 3</ins></a>. At $80, it covers most of the basics quite well.Now the company is improving its mid-range option with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-price-specs-152938907.html"><ins>the Elite 4 Active</ins></a>. It’s a more workout-focused model, complete with active noise cancellation (ANC) and enough moisture protection for the sweatiest of sessions. Like it did last year, Jabra is seeking to not only make its true wireless lineup compelling in terms of features and performance, but to also make the price more competitive. T<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:his $120 model" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">his $120 model</a> delivers a lot of options that we typically see on earbuds that go for $150-$180.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Elite 4 Active carries Jabra’s new design that debuted on the Elite 3, Elite 7 Active and Elite 7 Pro last year. Instead of a mostly circular earbud with an elbow that holds the microphones, the company switched to a rounded triangle shape that offers a cleaner look. Most importantly, all of Jabra’s latest earbuds are significantly smaller than their predecessors and the Elite 4 Active continues that trend. The smaller size not only means these buds don’t stick out from your ears as much, but they’re also lighter and more comfy.</p><p>I wouldn’t blame you for mistaking the Elite 4 Active for the Elite 3. Aesthetically, the main difference is the outer panel on the 3 is one big button, while that area on the 4 Active is seamless. The button is there, but it’s sealed off. Jabra increased the water resistance to IP57 for this model, and the onboard controls are one area where it had to increase protection. Of course, Jabra has always designed its earbuds with the Active label for workouts. Better sweat protection is usually part of that formula.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e3-74ba-11ec-bffb-90a988efc117" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices. With the Elite 4 Active, you get upgrades like ANC and better water resistance over the base model Elite 3. Sound quality is good and battery life is solid, which helps make up for the lack of premium conveniences. " data-uuid="c57e6aee-ae1a-379d-b836-db1f598dcd18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The lack of a defined panel or button proved to be an issue for me when accessing the controls. I had to train myself to remember to press in the middle of the earbud as getting too far to the top or bottom wouldn’t register my actions. The outer surface of the Elite 4 Active is completely smooth, without so much as a raised dot to indicate you’re in the right place. Over time I might get used to this, but after a couple weeks of testing, I’m still not nailing it consistently.</p><p>Like every other Jabra model, you can tailor the Elite 4 Active to your needs via the company’s Sound+ app. Since this set is Jabra’s mid-range option, you get more features than the entry-level Elite 3, but not quite as much as the Elite 7 Pro or Elite 7 Active. First, there’s ANC and it’s customizable. Notice I didn’t say <em>adjustable</em>. Specifically, the app lets you set a level of noise cancellation during initial setup. You can also tweak the balance if you need more on one side than the other. Jabra will allow you to repeat this process if you need to, but there’s no easily accessible slider like the Elite 7 models.</p><p>The company’s transparency mode, HearThrough, can be controlled in the app via a slider. In fact, you can even set what the on-board control for sound mode does (single press on the left side). You can have it cycle through HearThrough and ANC, HearThrough and off or HearThrough, ANC and off. The app also allows you to turn on and off Sidetone, which lets you hear your voice when you’re on a call. Unlike some Jabra models, it isn’t adjustable – just all or nothing. Still, being able to hear yourself so you’re a bit less shouty over Zoom is better for everyone. The company’s own Find My feature returns as well, helping you locate a misplaced earbud if you’re willing to give it the proper permissions. And on Android, you can opt for one-touch access to Spotify if that’s your preferred streaming service.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e0-74ba-11ec-bfff-1dd3c0fb99f1" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices.

" data-uuid="192be981-ae78-3073-ba1a-9bce1686fb22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a $120 set of earbuds, I wouldn’t blame you for not expecting too much in the sound department. However, Jabra has a track record of solid audio across its true wireless lineup. With the Elite 4 Active, the company maintains its reputation for buds that sound good, but not great. There’s decent clarity and nice detail, but they lack the wider soundstage and depth pricier models from the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html"><ins>Sennheiser</ins></a> offer.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has pretty good sonic range, but big bombastic tracks like Run The Jewels “Mean Demeanor” and Gojira’s “Another World” sound overly compressed. The bass is solid and not muddy, so keeping the energy up during workouts with hip hop, EDM, or isn’t a problem. It’s just that on the whole, songs lack the dimensional punch you can find with a bigger investment. For $120 though, the Elite 4 Active gets the job done in most cases.</p><p>If you find yourself yearning to tweak the EQ, you can do that in the Sound+ app via a set of sliders. If one-tap audio changes are more your style, Jabra also offers a collection of presets for quick customization. It’s not the most robust set of options for dialing in the sound, but it’s more than you get on the ultra affordable Elite 3.</p><p>One advantage the Elite 4 Active has over the Elite 3 is active noise cancellation. As I mentioned, you can customize the feature to a degree, but it’s not as powerful as what’s on Jabra’s pricer earbuds. Still, the ANC here will help block out some distractions, just don’t expect it to do a lot of heavy lifting.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has four microphones for calls. Jabra says they’re covered with a “special mesh” to reduce wind noise when you’re outdoors. Typically, mileage varies greatly on call quality with true wireless earbuds. Most of the time you just end up sounding like you’re on speakerphone. With the Elite 4 Active, the call quality is slightly better, but still not as good as if you had a microphone closer to your mouth – or even pointed more towards your face. Background noise is reduced when you’re talking, but any environmental roar is distracting when you’re not.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f37de552-4588-4246-b24a-6321b5ec3595"/><p>Jabra says you can expect up to seven hours of battery life on the Elite 4 Active, with three additional charges in the case for a total of 28 hours. The company doesn’t specify whether or not that’s with ANC on, but in my tests I managed seven and a half hours with noise canceling active. It’s by no means the best battery life you’ll find in true wireless earbuds, but it’s certainly enough to get you through a workday if you take a break or two. If you run out of juice before you head out the door, a quick charge feature gives you an hour of use in 10 minutes.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:At $120" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">At $120</a>, Jabra is offering solid mid-range specs at the same price as some companies’ budget models. What’s more, most of those don’t offer ANC, let alone a transparency mode or customizable sound. Samsung put noise canceling inside of its cheapest true wireless model with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html"><ins>Galaxy Buds 2</ins></a>. These earbuds are tiny and comfy and wireless charging is included, but the ANC performance is just okay. Plus, the Galaxy Buds 2 are only IPX2 rated, so you’ll want to be careful about how wet you get them. Full price they’re $150, but we’ve seen them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-2-are-back-on-sale-for-100-143041841.html"><ins>as low as $100</ins></a>.</p><p>If you’re looking to maximize your dollars, I’d suggest looking into Anker’s Soundcore line. You can find a lot of value, and features, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html"><ins>for well under $100</ins></a> there. Plus, the company’s top-of-the-line flagship ANC model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html"><ins>the Liberty 3 Pro</ins></a>, is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:only $170" href="https://amzn.to/34E5QlA">only $170</a>. And if you’re good with passive noise isolation, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>Jabra’s own Elite 3</ins></a> can get the job done <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:for $60" href="https://amzn.to/3KkwjVU">for $60</a>.</p><p>If Jabra’s new mission is to deliver the same overall quality as its previous earbuds at more affordable prices, I’m here for it. With the Elite 4 Active, as it did with the Elite 3, the company has managed to offer a compelling set of features at a great price. It hasn’t cut corners to do so, improving details like design and fit while maintaining its standard for sound quality. There are some omissions, but all the basics are covered and for the most part done well. Once again, we have more evidence that you don’t need to spend over $150 in order to get a set of good true wireless earbuds.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-review-140024466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f2a5b69-54f8-4281-adfd-2758abc415ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642112077</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T22:14:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Final Fantasy XIV' will go back on sale on January 25th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New players will be able to purchase digital copies of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> again starting on January 25th, the game&#39;s director and producer Naoki Yoshida has <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9a6bed5c06ae511c363ece5ead0a98a3986554a2">announced</a> in a lengthy post. Square Enix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-suspends-final-fantasy-xiv-sales-114053735.html">suspended</a> the game&#39;s physical and digital sales in mid-December last year, because it was doing too well for what the company could handle at the time. People have had to wait hours to get in when they try to play at peak times, because the &quot;dense concentration of play hours... far exceed [the game&#39;s] server capacity.&quot; Unfortunately, the developer wasn&#39;t able to add more servers before the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-endwalker-november-23rd-214301453.html"><em>Endwalker</em></a> expansion was released due to the global semiconductor shortage.&nbsp;</p><p>In his post, Yoshida explained the steps the company is taking to address the game&#39;s high levels of congestion. To start with, Square Enix is bringing its Oceanian Data Center online also on January 25th and opening five new Worlds from the start so that everyone in Oceania can transfer over for a better experience. The world transfer service is currently suspended, but it will resume on January 26th — further, those transferring to the new Oceanian Worlds will be able to do so for free.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yoshida has also revealed that Square Enix has been working on expanding its Japanese, European and North American data centers. The company explained that due to the global semiconductor shortage, it took some time to procure the needed components to be able to bring them online. In fact, it has to establish the new data centers in phases, because it&#39;s still having a tough time securing the necessary server equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>For North America, the first phase of the expansion will happen sometime in August 2022, and it will see four new Worlds go online. The second phase will be implemented in the summer of 2023 and will open four more Worlds.  For Japan, the developer plans to add one more logical data center to the current three in order to lower the number of Worlds for each of them. The European expansion will also happen in two phases, the first of which is scheduled for July 2022 and will bring four new Worlds online. In the summer of 2023, Square Enix will establish one new logical data center with eight new Worlds in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once again, I wish to apologize for the delays to server expansion caused by the global semiconductor shortage,&quot; Yoshida wrote. He also asked for players&#39; understanding in resuming sales of the game, even though some may consider the decision to be premature. Square Enix will monitor server stability following the resumption of sales and could restart free trials if everything goes well. However, in case servers &quot;continue to experience extreme levels of congestion&quot; despite all the steps it&#39;s taking, the developer may consider suspending digital sales once again.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-back-on-sale-january-25th-133146587.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24ba88cf-cb91-40b3-8acd-8f7a99a3649a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:31:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642168144</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T13:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft opens a third-party review into its harassment and discrimination policies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has hired a third -party law firm to review its policies on sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883416/microsoft-board-harassment-discrimination-report"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported. As part of that, the final report will summarize the results of sexual harassment investigations against the company&#39;s senior leadership and board of directors, including  former CEO Bill Gates.&nbsp;</p><p>The report will &quot;lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company&#39;s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies,&quot; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56">press release</a>.

This will include a review of concerns raised by employees in 2019 in the “In Need of Assistance” email thread, steps the company has taken to respond to these concerns, and additional steps that could further strengthen these safeguards. The review will also include an analysis of policies, practices, and commitments to create a safe, inclusive work environment.</p></blockquote><p>Microsoft had been planning to disclose how it implements sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, with a key request being the disclosure of executive-level investigations. However, late last year, Microsoft shareholders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html">forced the company</a> to write up an annual report detailing how it handles sexual harassment cases within the company.&nbsp;</p><p>The review will be conducted by the law firm Arent Fox and will look at allegations of discrimination and harassment arising from an internal <a href="https://qz.com/1587477/microsoft-investigating-sexual-harassment-claims-overlooked-by-hr/">Microsoft email chain</a> back in 2019. In over 90 pages of emails, female employees alleged that they were harassed and denied promotions and pay raises, among other issues. They further complained that managers and the company&#39;s HR department took no action in many cases. Microsoft was also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-13-microsoft-faces-238-complaints-of-gender-discrimination-harassment.html">accused</a> of 238 cases of gender discrimination or sexual harassment in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>While the board will assess the previous investigation against Gates, it won&#39;t reinvestigate the affair that happened in 2000. Gates resigned from Microsoft&#39;s board in early March of 2020, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803">reportedly</a> before the investigation was complete.</p><p>&quot;We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hires-an-outside-firm-to-review-its-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-132048142.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0200492-ec42-429e-9673-1a617a4ba7c0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:20:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642164961</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T12:56:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of Microsoft Corporation headquarters at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris,  France, April 18, 2016.

Take the Xperia 5 III. After launching in other regions <em>last year</em>, the phone is only now available stateside for $1,000. This is its middle-ish high-end phone, with the flagship Xperia 1 series of smartphones (seen above) both bigger and pricier.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-high-end-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000-095934384.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9131cfc0-7535-11ec-8fff-5d8b67023191" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="0b89caea-854b-3b8d-8d14-c4c9cda03c86"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>For that price, this Xperia does have things to offer.

The plaintiffs — two users from California and one from Chicago — are accusing the company of unlawfully seizing their personal property and violating racketeering laws. They&#39;re now proposing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all other users who&#39;ve had their accounts frozen before and are seeking restitution, as well as punitive and exemplary damages.</p><p>Lena Evans, one of the plaintiffs who&#39;d been a PayPal user for 22 years, said the website seized $26,984 from her account six months after it got frozen without ever telling her why. Evans had been using PayPal to buy and sell clothing on eBay, to exchange money for a poker league she owns and for a non-profit that helps women with various needs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fellow plaintiff Roni Shemtov said PayPal seized over $42,000 of her money and never got an acceptable reason for why her account was terminated. She received several different explanations when she contacted the company: One customer rep said it was because she used the same IP and computer as other Paypal users, while another said it was because she sold yoga clothing at 20 to 30 percent lower than retail. Yet another representative allegedly said it was because she used multiple accounts, which she denies.&nbsp;</p><p>Shbadan Akylbekov, the third plaintiff, said PayPal seized over $172,000 of his money without giving him any explanation why the account got limited in the first place. Akylbekov used the account of a company his wife owns to sell Hyaluron pens, which are needle-less pens that inject hyaluronic acid into the skin. After the money disappeared from the account following a six-month freeze, PayPal allegedly sent his wife a letter that says she &quot;violated PayPal&#39;s User Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) by accepting payments for the sale of injectable fillers not approved by the FDA.&quot; It also said that the money was taken from her account &quot;for its liquidated damages arising from those AUP violations pursuant to the User Agreement.&quot;</p><p>PayPal has long angered many a user for limiting accounts and freezing their funds for six months or more. One high-profile case was American poker player Chris Moneymaker&#39;s who had $12,000 taken from his account after six months of being limited. Moneymaker was already in the process of <a href="https://www.poker.org/chris-moneymaker-to-sue-paypal-for-12000-in-seized-funds/">asking people</a> to join him in a class action lawsuit before his funds were &quot;mysteriously returned.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the complaint reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Plaintiffs bring this class action against Defendant PAYPAL, INC. (&quot;PayPal&quot;) to recover damages and other relief available at law and in equity on behalf of themselves, as well as on behalf of the members of the class defined herein... This action stems from Defendant’s widespread business practice of unilaterally seizing funds from its clients’ financial accounts, without cause and without any fair or due process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>PayPal places a &quot;hold&quot; on Plaintiffs&#39; own funds in their own PayPal accounts. PayPal has failed to inform Plaintiffs and members of the class of the reason(s) for the actions PayPal has taken, even telling Plaintiffs and members of the class that they will &quot;have to get a subpoena&quot; to learn the simple information as to why PayPal was holding, and denying Plaintiffs, access to their own money.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paypal-lawsuit-freezing-customer-accounts-funds-073128563.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18f5b3b4-9cea-4f5f-8f80-57263face538</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 07:31:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642145490</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T07:31:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/4acebb90-cb52-11e9-8bfc-78096ef73d84" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/4acebb90-cb52-11e9-8bfc-78096ef73d84" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[serg3d via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[San Jose, USA - June 27, 2015: PayPal Headquarters]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PayPal Headquarters]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's Spanish-language moderators have reportedly been working in unsafe conditions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret Meta employs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-facebook-will-hire-3-000-moderators-to-prevent-livestreamed-viol.html">contract laborers</a> to do much of the hard work of enforcing its content moderation policies on Facebook. And despite assisting one of the most valuable companies in the world, those workers have frequently complained of their jobs involving poor compensation and anxiety-inducing work. Some are now also saying they’re being treated worse than other workers.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/facebooks-spanish-language-moderators-said-theyre-treated"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, Genpact, a Meta subcontractor that has previously been accused of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-content-india-feature-idUSKCN1QH15I">fostering poor working conditions</a>, has required the Spanish-language moderators out of its Richardson, Texas office to report for in-person work since April 2021. Those workers have had to put their health at risk against both the delta and omicron coronavirus variants while their English-language counterparts have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The news of the situation at Genpact comes just one week after workers at Accenture, another Meta subcontractor, successfully protested to force the company to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-moderators-work-from-home-223951103.html">scrap a requirement</a> it had in place for hundreds of Facebook moderators to return to in-person work on January 24th.</p><p>Contractors who spoke to <em>BuzzFeed News </em>claim Genpact also holds them to unreasonable standards. They say they’re expected to make moderation decisions in about a minute while maintaining an 85 percent accuracy rate. Complicating everything is the fact that Meta reportedly doesn’t disseminate guidelines on how to apply Facebook’s <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Community Standards</a> in a language other than English, leaving those workers in a situation where they’re forced to first translate that guidance before applying it.&nbsp;</p><p>And there’s the scale of the problem the team has to tackle. Genpact’s Spanish-language moderation team is named after Mexico but in addition to moderating content posted by people living in the North American country, they’re also responsible for Facebook and Instagram posts from Spanish-speaking users in most Latin American countries as well. In Mexico alone, Facebook has more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-mexico-facebook-faces-challenges-as-it-seeks-to-keep-democracy-honest/2018/06/22/098d5f3a-7624-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html">84 million users</a>. By contrast, the Genpact Mexican market team consists of approximately 50 individuals.</p><p>“We use the combination of technology and people to keep content that breaks our rules off of our platform, and while AI has made progress in this space, people are a key part of our safety efforts,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget. “We know these jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams.”</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-genpact-spanish-langauge-descrimination-001938677.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44b6b8d3-eef0-447d-8360-773547be3993</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:19:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642162388</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T12:13:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69777bd0-4239-11ec-bff3-daacf01891f3" width="4900" height="3109" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69777bd0-4239-11ec-bff3-daacf01891f3" width="4900" height="3109" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman holds a smartphone with Meta logo on it in front of a displayed Facebook logo in this illustration taken, October 28, 2021.

There’s a simple reason for that. Far too often, they’re too long and difficult to parse. Some services offer summary statements, but they’re the exception, not the norm.</p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers made up of Representative Lori Trahan and Senators Bill Cassidy and Ben Ray Luján of Louisana and New Mexico want to change that. They’ve introduced the <a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act.pdf"><ins>Terms-of-service Labelling, Design and Readability Act</ins></a> – that’s TLDR for short. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-privacy-label-december-8-233406513.html"><ins>Taking a page from Apple</ins></a>, the proposed legislation would require online businesses to include a “nutrition label-style” summary at the top of their terms of service agreements and make the contracts easy for researchers to examine through the use of XML tags. It would also require them to disclose any recent data breaches, as well as provide information on whether a user can delete their data and how they would go about doing that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“For far too long, blanket terms of service agreements have forced consumers to either ‘agree’ to all of a company’s conditions or lose access to a website or app entirely. No negotiation, no alternative, and no real choice,” said Representative Trahan. The group cites a <a href="https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf"><ins>2012 study</ins></a> that found it would take the average American 76 workdays to read all the terms of service contracts they’ve agreed to use their favorite online services as the basis for the need of the TLDR Act.

Reuters photographer Leah Millis: "Thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to overturn the recent election and prevent Joe Biden, a Democrat, from becoming the next president. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812. I arrived at the west side of the U.S. Capitol before the Trump supporters overwhelmed police lines, and I documented the chaos that ensued for the next seven hours. At one point I heard the crowd chanting "heave-ho" and thought they must be breaking in through the doors. I didn't want to risk getting crushed or injured by the massive crowd, which was hostile toward members of the media and had already assaulted several of my colleagues that day. I chose to risk climbing some scaffolding that had been erected for the upcoming inauguration to give me a better view. The Capitol had already been breached via different entrances, but the fight for this entrance went on for hours. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the mob of Trump supporters and in the process multiple officers were severely injured. Four people would die that day and a police officer attacked by protesters died the next day. Four officers later took their own lives. Eventually, law enforcement was able to successfully push the crowd back. At 5:04 p.m. to disperse the remaining protesters, they used a flash-bang grenade, which released a blinding light that illuminated the U.S. Capitol building. To me, the explosion of the grenade captured the violence and shock of the day: American citizens attacking and breaching their own country's Capitol building.

The group&#39;s Capitol incursion, meanwhile, was partly fuelled by online <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html">election misinformation</a> promoting unsupported claims of widespread fraud during the 2020 presidential vote.</p><p>The Oath Keepers already lost much of their online presence in the months before and after the Capitol incident, but the new charges could make it that much harder for the group or its members to maintain that internet representation. This also underscores social media outlets&#39; imperfect attempts to curb violent organizations and the misinformation that fuels them. While more aggressive crackdowns wouldn&#39;t have necessarily stopped the 2021 breach, outlets like Facebook have acknowledged they could have done more to curb groups that spread and acted on that misinformation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oath-keepers-leader-charged-capitol-breach-211007516.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a88ebdfe-d93c-4446-b678-507afd26bff5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 21:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642108208</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T21:10:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/18a831d0-74a3-11ec-bf4f-d938bc0fd0a8" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/18a831d0-74a3-11ec-bf4f-d938bc0fd0a8" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Urquhart / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oath Keepers founder, Stewart Rhodes, speaks during the Patriots Day Free Speech Rally in Berkeley, California, U.S. April 15, 2017.

In a <a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-open-source-software-safer-and-more-secure/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> the company published following the White House’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/log4shell-vulnerability-log4j-155543990.html"><ins>Log4j vulnerability</ins></a> summit on Thursday, Kent Walker, president of global affairs and chief legal officer at Google and Alphabet, said the country needs a public-private partnership that will work to properly fund and staff the most essential open-source projects.</p><p>“For too long, the software community has taken comfort in the assumption that open source software is generally secure due to its transparency and the assumption that ‘many eyes’ were watching to detect and resolve problems,” he said. “But in fact, while some projects do have many eyes on them, others have few or none at all.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Walker, the partnership would look at the influence and importance of a project to determine how critical it is to the wider ecosystem. Looking to the future, he says the industry needs new ways to identify software that may, down the line, pose a systemic risk to internet security.</p><p>Walker said there’s also a need for more public and private funding, noting Google is ready to contribute to an organization that matches volunteers from companies like itself to critical projects that need the most support. “Open source software is a connective tissue for much of the online world — it deserves the same focus and funding we give to our roads and bridges,” he said.</p><p>The importance of open-source software has been a topic of a lot of discussions following the discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability. Log4j happens to be one of the most popular and widely used logging library, with services like Steam and iCloud depending on it.

It&#39;s the sort of thing that gets you dragged into US federal court. And that&#39;s exactly what Krafton, maker of <em>PUBG Mobile, </em>is doing to Garena Online over accusations that the Singapore-based game developer has once again infringed its battle royale IP. What&#39;s more, Krafton has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22882099/pubg-developers-lawsuit-apple-google-garena-clones">named Google and Apple in its complaint</a>.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time that Krafton has sued Garena Online. In 2017, Krafton filed suit in Singapore over the sale of <em>Free Fire: Battlegrounds, </em>Garena&#39;s suspiciously <em>PUBG</em>-like mobile shooter, but ended up settling that case. Now, Krafton is suing Garena again, over <em>Free Fire</em> again, but this time in US federal court.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Krafton alleges that after settling in 2017, Garena immediately resumed selling <em>Free Fire</em> on both Google Play and the Apple App Store without entering into any sort of licencing agreement to use the litigated game content. Additionally, Garena started selling of another battle royale game of questionable copyright pedigree, <em>Free Fire Max</em>, this past September. As such, Krafton is suing Garena for copyright infringement claiming that “Garena has earned hundreds of millions of dollars from its global sales of the infringing apps,&quot; and holding both the Google and Apple marketplaces liable for damages for hosting the content. Krafton, which is headquartered in Seoul, South Korea, has not specified damages outside of a statutory $150,000 per infringement.&nbsp;</p><p>Copyright infringement claims like this are wildly common throughout the tech industry with legal departments <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-ar-glasses-maker-nreal-trademark-infringement-lawsuit-171513351.html">constantly on the prowl</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/music-publishers-sue-roblox-and-twitch-over-copyrighted-music-in-streams-115033261.html">potential IP violations</a>, be they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-lawsuit-patent-infringement-on-demand-classes-202028622.html">intentional or not</a>.

Sadly, that’s precisely what one New Mexico school district employee did. Kristy Stock was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for her role in a scheme to steal and resell more than 3,000 iPods intended for Native American students.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-new-mexico-school-district-employee-sentenced-18-months-federal-prison-stealing"><ins>release issued by the Department of Justice</ins></a> details the charges against Stock of tax fraud and transportation of stolen goods. According to her plea agreement and court documents, the scheme began back in 2013 when she was in charge of a program for the Central Consolidated School District of New Mexico designed to provide devices to Native American students living on tribal reservations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While overseeing the program, Stock was supposed to use federal grant money to buy iPods to distribute to students. However, thanks to help from other conspirators including her friend James Bender and Saurabh Chawla, the group ended up shipping the stolen iPods to Maryland where they were listed on eBay before being sold at a “substantial” markup.</p><p>Due to his own account having previously been suspended due to security concerns, Chawla was forced to use Bender’s eBay account to list the stolen devices for auction, with Bender serving as an intermediary. Later, between 2015 and 2018, Stock communicated directly with Chawla, providing info on the make, model, color and quantity of devices before agreeing on a price and putting them up for auction.</p><p>All told, Stock admitted that she made more than $800,000 from selling stolen iPods between 2013 and 2018. To make matters worse, Stock also filed fraudulent tax returns on the income, resulting in tax loss of around $270,000. That said, while Stock faces an 18-month prison sentence, she actually got off lighter than her co-conspirator Chawla, who was sentenced to 66 months after failing to pay more than $700,000 in taxes. Meanwhile, Bender was sentenced to just 366 days in prison.</p><p>So while Stock and her crew eventually got caught, the real lesson is that here is that crime doesn’t pay–especially if you’re stealing from children and then lying on your taxes about your ill-gotten income.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/woman-sentenced-to-prison-for-stealing-over-3000-ipods-intended-for-native-american-students-194009681.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fa92df1-f821-4e26-a1d7-0e472e126438</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:40:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642101507</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T19:19:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/645cb010-74a3-11ec-97ed-caf007601916" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a4e62440-74a3-11ec-bf57-613d22b5d24c" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gado via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close-up of an Apple iPod Nano 7th generation music player, produced ca 2012, on a light gray surface in Lafayette, California, December 25, 2021.
