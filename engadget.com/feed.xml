The company&#39;s new DualUp Monitor has an unusual 16:18 aspect ratio. It&#39;s a vertical display with a 2,560 x 2,880-pixel resolution that LG is calling &quot;Square Double QHD.&quot; When you use its vertical split view function, the DualUp looks like you put two 21.5—inch monitors on top of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be a better form factor than the typical monitor if you&#39;re constantly having to look at information on multiple windows or screens for work or for any other reason. In its announcement, LG says the model will help reduce side-to-side head movements that cause neck pain. DualUp was also meant to save space and will ship with the LG Ergo stand that clamps to most desks and tables. The Nano IPS monitor&#39;s other features include a brightness of 300 nits, a 1000:1 contrast ratio and HDR10 support.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to DualUp, LG has also introduced the UltraFine, a 32-inch 4K UHD monitor. It has a more conventional aspect ratio, but it is the first to use LG&#39;s Nano IPS Black panel technology, which enables a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The company will reveal more about both premium monitors at its virtual press event on January 4th. It&#39;s unknown at this point whether LG will still push through with a physical experience at CES 2022, assuming the event will still take place despite the threat posed by the Omicron variant. It was planning on showcasing a list of new items during the conference aside from these monitors, though, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html">soundbar</a> with a center up-firing speaker, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">wireless TV on wheels</a> and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED TV with a motorized cover</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-dualup-monitor-051303157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b44c61f8-811b-41df-90f8-324bbfc46e46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 05:13:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640149986</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T05:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Both the LG UltraFineâ¢ Display (model 32UQ85R) and LG DualUp Monitor (model 28MQ780) offer sleek and practical designs, enhanced connectivity and superior user experience for both home and office workers, including creative professionals and programmers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG-DualUp-Lifestyle-00]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Voice now lets you decide who goes to voicemail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google now lets you customize how its Voice service <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/set-custom-rules-for-incoming-google-voice-calls.html">handles incoming calls</a>.

The company has <a href="https://tascam.com/us/magazines/detail/866">introduced</a> a 424 Studio Master High Bias Type II Cassette designed for the brand&#39;s decades-old Portastudio four-track cassette recorders. Artists can record analog samples and tunes without hunting down rare tapes and fretting over degradation.</p><p>The cassette isn&#39;t a perfect match. Tascam said it&#39;s using existing magnetic oxides to produce tape that&#39;s as close &quot;as possible&quot; to the material Portastudios were meant to use, but recorder owners may still have to do some &quot;fine tuning&quot; to adjust for 2021-era cassettes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, this isn&#39;t just an appeal to nostalgia — to some extent, it&#39;s about the preservation of analog cassette recording. Cassette production has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-10-cassette-tape-material-shortage.html">suffering from oxide shortages</a> since 2019, years after a (still-ongoing) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cassette-inventor-lou-ottens-has-died-213101596.html">tape revival</a>. Tascam noted that it&#39;s now the sole company making High Bias Type II cassettes. While there are tapes already on the market, they&#39;re both rare and expensive.</p><p>Availability is only listed as &quot;soon.&quot; Tascam&#39;s cassettes also won&#39;t satisfy creators who want genuinely new recorders to replace a shrinking supply of old hardware. This might be the next best thing, though, and could be a relief for Portastudio fans who don&#39;t want to make a complete leap into the digital realm.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tascam-new-cassettes-old-four-track-recorders-202319184.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b884cc1-1287-443a-96d4-fbafd4e594b9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 20:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640119434</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T20:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tascam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' final commemorative Xbox sneakers are now on sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html"><ins>October</ins></a>, Microsoft and Adidas have been releasing commemorative Xbox-themed sneakers to mark the brand&#39;s 20th anniversary. It all started with a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html">Forum Tech</a> shoes the two companies gave away to a group of lucky fans.

As with the other sneakers in the series, you&#39;ll find plenty of clever references. For instance, the inner lining of the shoes draws on the design of the Xbox Series X&#39;s vents. Meanwhile, the heel and sole of shoes mirror the grips of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Overall, we wanted to create a shoe that cemented a moment in time, but also felt timeless,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;This is a shoe that is meant to be played in, meant to be worn, and meant to be enjoyed by our community – one that&#39;s always played in, and never played out.&quot;</p><p>You can buy the Xbox Series X Forum Tech Boost from the <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/xbox-forum-techboost-shoes/GW6374.html">Adidas website for $140</a>. If you&#39;re not a sneakerhead, Microsoft has released other commemorative products to mark the console&#39;s 20th birthday, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-transluscent-controller-160707355.html"><ins>translucent controller</ins></a> that pays homage to the original Xbox debug kit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-xbox-series-x-sneakers-193013642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35bf698a-7004-4f09-99f0-f644b61a4af7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640114066</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T19:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft / Adidas]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo offers a first look at its desktop web browser]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/duckduckgo/"><ins>DuckDuckGo</ins></a> has offered an early peek at its upcoming desktop app. In <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/"><ins>a blog post</ins></a> that recaps the company&#39;s year, CEO Gabriel Weinberg looked toward the future as well. He said DuckDuckGo will bring the privacy protections the company is known for to the app. You can expect the speed and simplicity of its mobile app too.</p><p>&quot;Robust privacy protection&quot; will be enabled by default for search, browsing, email and more. Weinberg said the app isn&#39;t a &quot;privacy browser&quot; per se, but rather &quot;an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it did on mobile, DuckDuckGo is building the app using OS-provided rendering engines instead of basing it on projects like Chromium. According to Weinberg, that helped the development team to &quot;strip away a lot of the unnecessary cruft and clutter that’s accumulated over the years in major browsers.&quot;</p><p>Along with a streamlined interface and the Fire Button (which closes all tabs and wipes browsing data in a single tap), the DuckDuckGo desktop is cleaner and much more private than Chrome, Weinberg said. He also claimed it&#39;s &quot;significantly faster&quot; than Google&#39;s browser, based on early tests — here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s less of a memory hog than Chrome too. DuckDuckGo didn&#39;t reveal when it plans to release the desktop app.</p><p>Weinberg notes that, over the last 12 months, DuckDuckGo has bolstered its search and tracker blocking features. He said DuckDuckGo&#39;s mobile app is now the most downloaded Android browser in key markets. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-email-protection-tracking-pixels-privacy-151024634.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> a free email forwarding service that removes tracking pixels from messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-desktop-app-browser-privacy-184913408.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da314e59-b769-4a7a-aaf2-80a878aa8f73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:49:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640112556</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T18:49:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey caused an uproar with a bizarre Web3 Twitter rant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the internet’s most vocal proponents of Bitcoin voiced an unusually uncharacteristic opinion against Web3 this week.

That&#39;s a not-so-subtle dig at the onslaught of reboots and remakes dominating our culture — revisiting characters and stories we already know is, well, safe. Audiences know what to expect, and it&#39;s a better bet for risk-averse studios. Of course, Morpheus (now played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen) is also commenting on the film he&#39;s in.</p><p>More than twenty years after <em>The Matrix</em> fundamentally reshaped genre cinema, director Lana Wachowski is finally diving back into the universe that made her and co-director Lilly Wachowski renowned. After all that time, is it really worth going back down the rabbit hole, or is this just another easy franchise cash-grab?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The answer to that question depends on what you want from a <em>Matrix </em>sequel. Like <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> and <em>Revolutions </em>before it, Wachowski (along with co-writers David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon) isn&#39;t interested in merely retreading the past with <em>Resurrections</em>. Instead, it&#39;s a film that&#39;s keenly aware of its legacy, our relationship with its characters, and the lofty expectations that fans (and studios!) have when rebooting a beloved property.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d252-626c-11ec-9ffb-6eb31f3af5eb" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="6731a42e-5529-369a-953b-b6b815399259"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>As someone who adored the original film, and found plenty to respect in the much-maligned sequels, <em>Resurrections</em> feels made just for me. It&#39;s intoxicating, thrilling and unabashedly romantic. But judging from the polarizing early critical responses, it&#39;s clearly not for everyone.</p><div id="23e3dca2e84a4e2999cefc4162bf8f87"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><strong><em>Minor spoilers ahead.</em></strong></p><p>It&#39;s hard to talk about what <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> is without describing its basic setup, most of which you can gather from the film&#39;s trailers. Keanu Reeves returns as Thomas Anderson, a programmer adrift in a world that doesn&#39;t quite make sense to him. He meets a woman played by Carrie-Anne Moss, but this time she&#39;s not the Agent-whupping bad-ass Trinity, she&#39;s just your typical (albeit, strikingly beautiful) mom. The two feel an instant connection. Thomas eventually gets ripped out of the world he&#39;s in thanks to a plucky new character named Bugs (Jessica Henwick), he finds the real world, and <em>yadda yadda</em>, you get the picture.</p><p>Now, you might be asking yourself, &quot;Didn&#39;t Neo and Trinity die in <em>The Matrix Revolutions?&quot; </em>All I can do is point at the title of the movie — what did you expect? This time, Anderson is a renowned game developer known for creating an popular trilogy of games that retell the entire <em>Matrix</em> story. When we first meet him, he&#39;s faced with a new challenge: making a fourth entry. He approaches it with the same sense of dread the Wachowskis likely felt about tackling a potential <em>Matrix 4</em>. A series of brainstorming scenes feel as if they&#39;re pulled directly from their own hellish meetings with Warner Bros. Anderson&#39;s team can only focus on the surface — How do they go beyond bullet time? What if they just focus on more mindless action? — rather than anything truly substantive.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6608d6c96de34f6c857fcefc7a348e92" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-bacb-dfd87aec35f5" alt="Neo vs. Morpheus. inThe Matrix Resurrections"></section><p>As the film unfolds (and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not revealing any  major surprises), it&#39;s  impressive how Lana Wachowski elegantly avoids the traps most reboots fall into, as if she were in the Matrix herself, deftly avoiding all of the bullets aimed right at her. Sure, <em>Resurrections</em> brings some new special effects toys to the party, and it has the requisite action scenes you&#39;d expect. But in many ways it&#39;s more reminiscent of the Wachowski&#39;s recent works, like the time-hopping epic <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, and the unabashedly humanistic <em>Sense8</em>.</p><p><em>The Matrix Resurrections </em>wears its heart on its sleeve. It&#39;s far more interested in the transcendental possibilities of love than it is in laying the groundwork for a new trilogy of films. The fact that Wachowski is practically refusing to play by the current rules of Hollywood – set up the sequel by any means necessary! – feels almost revolutionary. She has one story to tell, and it means a lot to her. That’s it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3341e7f0-626c-11ec-9fef-39dad80f80d4" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="42032915-0055-3d23-8122-50308f99a39d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>Strangely enough, the movie <em>Resurrections </em>reminds me of most is Wes Craven’s <em>A New Nightmare</em>, a groundbreaking attempt at wrestling with a hugely popular genre franchise. That film – the seventh<em> A Nightmare on Elm Street </em>entry – brought Freddy Krueger into the real world to reclaim what made him terrifying. Throughout <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, it feels as if Wachowski is also ready to break the fourth wall with her sheer contempt for reboots, fan service and watered-down sequels. “The sheeple want control, certainty,” a villain says at one point. (At that moment, I couldn’t help but think of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html">utter failure of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a><em>. </em>Yes, the wound is still fresh.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-a7f7-0cdb34fc728d" alt="Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="541f946b-509a-3665-a268-55332506d96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>And this is where I come back to saying this movie isn’t for everyone.

Last year it took its recreation of the iconic chorus from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-jun-6-chorus-roland-juno-synth-plugin-free-080042654.html">Juno-6</a> and turned it into a stand alone effect. This year, it&#39;s breaking out the tape effects from its Mellotron emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>The original Mellotron is, of course, an iconic keyboard that played back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-21-mellotron-walkman-keyboard-crudman.html">tape loops</a> of other instruments — kind of like a proto-sampler. Arturia caught wind that some artists were using their Mellotron V plugin in an unexpected way. They were loading custom samples in and, rather than playing them back as a melody with the keyboard, simply adding the warmth and vibe of the simulated tape loops.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So this holiday season Arturia decided to just cut out the middleman and release Tape Mello-Fi as a standalone tape simulator plugin. It can add distortion, saturation, tape flutters and even some filtering. Its interface is simple and delivers everything from subtle warmth to full on machine malfunctions. There are even 25 presets included to get you started.</p><p>Of course, there are <em>tons</em> of lo-fi and tape simulation plugins out there. But Arturia&#39;s is particularly good. And, it&#39;s free. So there&#39;s really no reason not to grab it. And you should do it sooner than later. Tape Mello-Fi will be available as a free download from <a href="https://www.arturia.com/">Arturia&#39;s site</a> from December 21st through Friday December 31st. After that, well, who knows.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-free-tape-mello-fi-plugin-christmas-160020059.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ca1c117-f83b-4e19-b877-1fa788979dc0</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640023370</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T18:02:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researcher hacked an at-home COVID-19 test to give bogus results]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/find-out-if-you-have-covid-from-the-comfort-of-your-own-home-173043438.html">At-home COVID-19 tests</a> might not be as trustworthy as you&#39;d hope — not in the hands of a committed hacker, at least.

It&#39;s made of the most primitive materials in the Solar System, emerging from the dust disc that formed along with the Sun itself. It&#39;s also quite porous, like many asteroids. However, it&#39;s not quite a neat and tidy example. Most C-type asteroids have a low albedo (solar radiation reflectivity) of 0.03 to 0.09 due to their carbon, but Ryugu&#39;s is 0.02.

With people stuck at home last year, services saw millions of new subscribers — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">Netflix attracted 16 million customers in just three months</a>, alone. The early part of 2021 continued that trend, but as the year draws to a close, it appears <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-netflix-and-other-streaming-services-subs-arpu-q3-2021.html">the growth is slowing down across the board</a>. This suggests that as restrictions ease around the world, people might be returning to pre-pandemic norms.</p><p>But on the whole, 2021 was still a pretty big year for streaming. Netflix now has <a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/netflix-now-has-214-million-global-subscribers/">214 million global subscribers</a>, and services like Disney+ and HBO Max lured customers with exclusive TV shows and movies. US platforms, like Peacock, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-uk-ireland-sky-now-tv-streaming-164859612.html">expanded internationally</a> and online-only programming was well-represented at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-beats-all-studios-with-seven-oscars-064216443.html">multiple award shows</a>. Titles exclusive to streaming, such as <em>Squid Game</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, became part of the cultural landscape. A slow year or not, it’s clear that this is how most of us watch our shows now. Here are some of the biggest stories in streaming this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/efcc47a0-5efa-11ec-bfdd-2e3905269833" alt="Squid Game" data-uuid="a652d448-7ba3-3d4d-bfef-0b741805a14f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><h3>Netflix continues to dominate</h3><p>As mentioned above, Netflix is the undisputed leader in streaming with over 214 million subscribers worldwide. Sure, it’s faced a few challenges from rivals like Disney+ and Amazon Prime, but Netflix is still holding strong. Part of that is due to the company’s strategy of investing in original content that you can’t get anywhere else, like <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>The Crown</em>.</p><p>And of course, there’s <em>Squid Game</em> which is undoubtedly the number one TV show of the year. Netflix has said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html">around 142 million households</a> watched the Korean-language show, making it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history. There’s also the recently released <em>Red Notice</em>, which became <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/red-notice-netflix-all-time-most-popular-movie-1235118477/">the service’s most-watched movie</a> in its first 28 days of release, with around 328.8 million viewing hours in that time span. That tops the previous record held by <em>Bird Box</em>, which had 282 million viewing hours back in 2018.</p><p>Things don’t seem to be slowing down, either. Netflix has signed multi-year deals with big names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-kevin-hart-agree-to-a-multiyear-film-deal-231147872.html">Kevin Hart</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steven-spielberg-netflix-ambiln-175031862.html">Steven Spielberg</a>, it has exclusive rights for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Universal animated films</a> and it purchased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-reportedly-purchasing-the-rights-to-roald-dahls-entire-catalog-091947985.html">the rights to Roald Dahl’s entire catalog</a>. this phenomenon</p><p>Still, 2021 wasn’t without its hiccups. The largest one by far is when Netflix employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">staged a protest</a> over the CEO’s remarks defending Dave Chappelle’s standup special, which was heavily criticized for its transphobic content. CEO Ed Sarandos has since said he “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-internal-communication-over-dave-chappelle-special-080412118.html">screwed up</a>” on the messaging, but has not rescinded his defense.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d61bda60-5ef9-11ec-bfbd-1813cc4e3f80" alt="Loki" data-uuid="c1462c7d-056a-3e8f-a51a-2882e662904f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><h3>Disney+ proves it’s a serious contender</h3><p>Disney+, on the other hand, currently has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html">118.1 million</a> paid subscribers worldwide, which doesn’t quite compare to Netflix. But the service still gained ground in 2021, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/disney-plus-number-of-subscribers-us/">around 43 million more subscribers</a> compared to last year. A lot of that can be attributed to Disney’s powerhouse brands such as Pixar, Star Wars and, especially in 2021, Marvel.</p><p>2021 was when the Marvel Cinematic Universe released four different TV shows, all exclusively on Disney+: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-first-episode-marvel-universe-153051805.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-hawkeye-trailer-premiere-date-clint-barton-kate-bishop-hailee-steinfeld-140006373.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a>. This is a big deal, as Marvel has said that these TV series are key to the MCU’s “Phase Four” chapter, indicating that fans will likely want to watch them in order to understand the context behind upcoming movies set in the same universe.</p><p>But there was more to these shows that made them required viewing. As the first out the gate, <em>WandaVision</em> set the tone. The episodes were meant to be watched weekly, as each one spurred so-called “water cooler” discussions in-person and online. This felt a lot like “anti-binging” TV, as much of the appeal of these shows lay in the anticipation of what would happen next. At the very least, it showed that Disney+’s slate of original content — which also includes <em>The Mandalorian</em> and the upcoming <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> — could hold its own against that of more established platforms.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/98823320-5ef9-11ec-bb6b-355061f8bb40" alt="Wonder Woman 1984" data-uuid="506c6720-7300-393d-9af3-636095e4481a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. </div></figure><h3>The direct-to-streaming revolution that wasn’t</h3><p>During the thick of the pandemic, many movies eschewed theatrical releases for direct-to-streaming debuts. Examples include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-22-paramount-the-lovebirds-direct-to-netflix.html"><em>The Lovebirds</em></a>, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/g31871914/movies-streaming-early-coronavirus/"><em>Borat Subsequent Movie Film</em>,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-date-232629863.html"><em>Mulan</em></a> (via paid Premier Access), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em>Soul</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wonder-woman-hbo-max-december-25-234420280.html"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a>. That carried into this year as well, with Disney+ continuing its paid Premier Access model with <em>Cruella</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-184407477.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a> (<em>Luca</em>, however, did not have Premier Access release).</p><p>The biggest move, however, was when Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its movies in 2021 would have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html">one month exclusive access period on HBO Max</a> concurrent with the film’s domestic release. This meant that big blockbuster movies like <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Dune</em> and <em>Matrix 4</em> would be available on HBO Max on the same day they debuted in theaters <em>for an entire year</em>.</p><p>While some may have heralded this phenomenon as the future of entertainment, it looks to be short-lived. Disney revealed a few months ago that all of its remaining 2021 movies will get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">45-day head start</a> in theaters. This could be due to strong responses to titles like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>, but Disney might also want to avoid lawsuits like the one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">Scarlett Johansson filed</a> for breach of contract over shortened theatrical releases.

Now, it appears that the effort is a financial bust so far, too, as the company reportedly sold just 15 NFTs of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-players-can-invite-friends-to-join-them-for-free-212500525.html"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> gun skin as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-20-ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> reported.

On the other hand, Ubisoft may have been just dipping its toe into the water with one of its less high-profile, though still popular franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>For the minimum money collected so far, however, the effort may have done more harm than good. Ubisoft reportedly alienated its own French trade union, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-16-french-trade-union-calls-ubisoft-nft-scheme-a-useless-costly-ecologically-mortifying-technology">called NFTs</a> &quot;a useless, costly, ecologically mortifying tech.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fe03c4-70b5-4330-bdf1-6524d09ef5a0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:07:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640095946</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T14:12:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tiffany Haddish is getting her own Supernatural VR workout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Popular virtual reality workout app <em>Supernatural</em> is partnering with comedian Tiffany Haddish to release a new workout series.

It’s revealed what it calls its &quot;first gaming laptop&quot; with some high-end specs. The 17-inch UltraGear 17G90Q model packs an 11th-generation Intel Tiger Lake H CPU, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. A 300Hz 1080p IPS display should keep the battery life suitably lengthy, while the design aesthetic seems heavily inspired by Razer’s laptop series and other existing gaming PCs.

Comfort is improved over the previous models thanks to a smaller size, IPX4 moisture rating and more secure fit, features borrowed from the high-end WF-1000XM4 model.

The carriers have reached a deal with infrastructure provider BAI Communications, which is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/london-tube-full-mobile-coverage-104000309.html">building out a network</a> across the Tube as part of a 20-year concession with Transport for London.

This will make a huge difference to passengers, allowing them to make calls, read emails and check travel information while on the move. Investing in London’s connectivity and digital infrastructure is one important way we are helping to stimulate our city’s economy. It also represents a significant step towards ensuring the whole tube network has 5G-ready mobile coverage.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>London&#39;s Underground network has offered WiFi connectivity for almost a decade, but it&#39;s only available to customers of certain carriers on certain platforms. Earlier this year, Transport for London chose BAI Communications to build out a mobile network spanning all stations and tunnels, allowing commuters to check emails, watch videos and do everything else online on 4G or 5G even while they&#39;re inside metal tubes underground.&nbsp;</p><p>BAI has already started building the network at some of London&#39;s busiest stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston and Camden Town. They&#39;ll be the first to allow 4G and 5G connectivity by the end of 2022. City authorities expect the network to be completed and for the whole of London Underground to have mobile coverage by the end of 2024.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/three-ee-london-underground-114010662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d98ddc6f-0660-40b5-8781-0514512972a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640086813</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T11:40:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Travelpix Ltd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground transport system.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's holiday update adds TikTok and 'Sonic' to its infotainment system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s big holiday update for the year has started making its way to the automaker&#39;s fleet of electric vehicles, and it adds quite a large list of improvements and new features. For those addicted to scrolling on TikTok, perhaps the biggest addition is the TikTok app on Tesla Theater. According to the update notes posted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/20/tesla-releases-big-holiday-update-tiktok-app-ui-changes/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, they&#39;ll now be able to scroll the platform&#39;s short-form videos — on repeat, if they want — right on their vehicle&#39;s screen, so long as their car is parked.&nbsp;</p><p>In Toybox, owners will now also find the Light Show feature that Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-25-tesla-model-xmas-show.html">introduced</a> as an Easter Egg on the Model X back in 2015. For the Model X, a choreographed light show includes both flashing lights and opening falcon wing doors, but other models will have to make do with the former. Tesla has made its app launcher customizable, letting owners drag and drop their favorite apps onto the bottom menu bar. It&#39;s also simplifying navigation to make most the common primary controls, such as charging and windshield wipers, easier to access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To automatically see a live camera view of their blind spot when they activate their turn signal, drivers can activate the new &quot;Automatic Blind Spot Camera&quot; option under Autopilot in Controls. Plus, drivers can now edit Waypoints to add stops or to initiate new navigation routes with updated arrival times. The holiday bundle has updates that fit the season, as well, including automatic seat heating that can regulate the front row seat temperatures based on the cabin environment, along with other cold weather improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, drivers can now delete dashcam clips directly from the touchscreen and hide map details to remove distractions if they want. Finally, in the entertainment department, Tesla has added <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>and <em>Sudoku</em> to its Arcade — though we strongly suggest playing any Arcade game only while parked. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that Tesla allowed drivers to play some games in moving cars, a concern that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is discussing with the company. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">told Engadget</a> in a statement: &quot;Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens. We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-holiday-update-tiktok-sonic-110149488.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca97fd9d-c8a1-4c49-b1a6-07f630eb7d41</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640078522</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T09:22:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile says it blocked 21 billion scam calls in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/devices/t-mobile-releases-2021-scam-and-robocall-report">announced</a> that scam call traffic more than doubled in 2021 with attempts hitting an average of 425 million calls every week, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-says-it-blocked-21-billion-scam-calls-this-year/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a> reported.

By 2026, the Environmental Protection Agency will require that automaker fleets travel an average of about 55 miles per gallon, up from the 37 miles per gallon standard they’re held to as of this year.</p><p>The agency estimates the policy will save American drivers between $210 billion and $420 billion through 2050 on fuel costs. Over the life of a model year 2026 vehicle, that will translate to about $1,080 in individual consumer savings after factoring in the higher initial cost of a more efficient vehicle. The EPA estimates the policy will also prevent the release of about 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide over the same time frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We followed the science, we listened to stakeholders, and we are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet – and save families money at the same time,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.</p><p>The new standards effectively mirror those put forward by the Obama administration in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/business/energy-environment/obama-unveils-tighter-fuel-efficiency-standards.html">2012</a>. Had former President Trump not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-03-trump-epa-dot-fuel-emissions-proposal.html">weakened those in 2018</a>, they would have required automakers to make vehicles that could travel about 51 miles per gallon by 2025.</p><p>Jeff Alson, a former EPA senior engineer, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/climate/tailpipe-rules-climate-biden.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the new standards recapture the emissions cuts carved out by the Trump administration. “That’s good, but it’s not going to get us anywhere near the level we’ve got to get to reduce vehicle emissions enough to protect the planet,” he said.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota and Stellantis for comment on today&#39;s rulemaking.&nbsp;</p><p>The new standards mark the most significant climate action taken to date by President Biden. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">As of 2019</a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. However, the announcement comes just one day after Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-bill">would not support</a> the Democratic party’s Build Back Better plan. Among other items, the approximately $2 trillion plan includes a proposal for up to $12,500 in individual tax subsidies for Americans who buy an EV as their next car.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epa-2026-fuel-efficiency-standards-213930182.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">82f23298-315e-4f50-9200-1a653ea093ce</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 21:39:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640037316</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T21:55:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/2dbca2c0-ff04-11e9-b8ff-86c210405a4e" width="3008" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/2dbca2c0-ff04-11e9-b8ff-86c210405a4e" width="3008" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[plherrera via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rush hour traffic with smog.related:]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cars at Rush Hour Driving Through Thick Smog]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta is trying to find the people who created more than 39,000 phishing sites]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is taking legal action to disrupt a large-scale phishing campaign.
