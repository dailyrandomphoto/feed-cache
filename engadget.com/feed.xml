But, even in the face of criticism from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">White House</a>, a new report claims Facebook is still failing to delete even the most incendiary misinformation. As recently as last week, posts containing the hashtag #VaccinesKill were still active on the social network, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/08/tech/instagram-vaccine-misinformation/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only until the news publication warned the company of the lapse that it blocked the posts behind a message that read Facebook is &quot;keeping our community safe.&quot; To make matters worse, the same hashtag was banned by Facebook-owned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-instagram-blocking-anti-vaccine-hashtags.html">Instagram</a> almost two years prior. That action followed Facebook&#39;s pledge to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-facebook-instagram-anti-vaccine-content.html">crack down</a> on vaccine falsehoods, including bogus claims that they cause autism and other diseases, in the midst of a measles outbreak in New York.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This time round, the threat is even greater. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases of the Delta virus rising in the US, Facebook&#39;s latest slip-up will only draw more concern from policymakers. Just days ago, President Biden lambasted the company and other social networks by suggesting their failures were debilitating the vaccination drive. “They’re killing people,” Biden said.</p><p>In its defense, Facebook has previously noted that it&#39;s taking down more erroneous anti-vaccine information than ever before. In October, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-ads-discouraging-vaccines-165502226.html">banned ads</a> encouraging people to avoid getting vaccinated, following that with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html">wider clamp down</a> on anti-vaccine claims.&nbsp;</p><p>The company told <em>CNN </em>that it did not take action against the #VaccinesKill hashtag in the past as it did not meet its threshold. Facebook explained that it determines whether a hashtag violates its policies by looking at numerous factors, including the type and spread of content it is appearing in. &quot;Now, the #vaccineskill hashtag on Facebook violates our policies against misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines and we&#39;ve blocked it from search,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>At the same time, users are finding new ways to bypass the social network&#39;s misinformation rules. In May, some people began weaponizing Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">custom profile frames</a> to display false vaccine claims, forcing it to take them down.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-blocks-vaccines-kill-hashtag-094031580.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92297cb8-90d5-4062-87ea-ae6dda0138b4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:40:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626947123</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:45:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Emily Elconin / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nurses wait for people to come by to receive their coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at a mobile pop-up vaccination clinic hosted by the Detroit Health Department with the Detroit Public Schools Community District at East English Village Preparatory Academy in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 21, 2021.

As first reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a>, the DFEH sued the gaming giant after a two-year investigation wherein it came to the conclusion that the company discriminated against female employees. In addition to receiving smaller salaries than their male counterparts, female employees were also allegedly subjected to constant sexual harassment.</p><p>The DFEH enumerated several findings from its investigation in its <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/YJw">complaint</a> (PDF). Activision Blizzard&#39;s workforce is only about 20 percent women, and very few of them reach top roles in the company, the court document reads. Further, those who do reach higher roles earn less salary and total compensation than their male peers. Other female employees in non-executive roles are also paid less, promoted more slowly and terminated more quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DFEH also said that the defendant&#39;s &quot;frat boy&quot; culture is a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.&quot; Female employees constantly have to fend off unwanted sexual comments, the agency wrote. They have to endure being groped during &quot;cube crawls,&quot; in which male employees would drink alcohol as they make their way around various cubicles, as well. The document mentioned one particularly egregious case, in which a female employee took her own life during a business trip with a male supervisor who brought sex toys with him on the trip. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, that employee was severely harassed prior to her death, with her nude photos passed around during a company holiday party.</p><p>Activision Blizzard&#39;s HR department received a lot of harassment, discrimination and retaliation complaints, the DFEH said. However, the defendant allegedly failed to take &quot;effective remedial measures in response&quot; to them. Also, people were apparently discouraged from making complaints, since human resource personnel were known to be close to the alleged harassers.</p><p>The state agency has filed the lawsuit to force the video game titan to comply with California&#39;s workplace protections. It&#39;s also seeking unpaid wages and pay adjustments for female employees.</p><p>Activision Blizzard, however, denies DEFH&#39;s allegations. In a statement, the company said that the agency&#39;s lawsuit &quot;includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard&#39;s past.&quot; It called the DFEH&#39;s complaint &quot;inaccurate&quot; and described the lawsuit as the &quot;type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#39;s best businesses out of California.&quot;</p><p>The whole statement, courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-widespread-1847339746"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind. We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today. Over the past several years and continuing since the initial investigation started, we’ve made significant changes to address company culture and reflect more diversity within our leadership teams. We’ve updated our Code of Conduct to emphasize a strict non-retaliation focus, amplified internal programs and channels for employees to report violations, including the “ASK List” with a confidential integrity hotline, and introduced an Employee Relations team dedicated to investigating employee concerns. We have strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and combined our Employee Networks at a global level, to provide additional support. Employees must also undergo regular anti-harassment training and have done so for many years.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We put tremendous effort in creating fair and rewarding compensation packages and policies that reflect our culture and business, and we strive to pay all employees fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by non-discriminatory factors. For example, we reward and compensate employees based on their performance, and we conduct extensive anti-discrimination trainings including for those who are part of the compensation process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are confident in our ability to demonstrate our practices as an equal opportunity employer that fosters a supportive, diverse, and inclusive workplace for our people, and we are committed to continuing this effort in the years to come. It is a shame that the DFEH did not want to engage with us on what they thought they were seeing in their investigation.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34303078-143e-449d-a383-e2e9465cb573</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:03:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626944697</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:05:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/18: In this photo illustration, Activision Blizzard logo of a video game company is seen on a smartphone screen in front of Blizzard Entertainment logo.

That&#39;s part of the social network&#39;s latest experimental feature designed to give it more insight on what kind of replies users find relevant in a conversation. According to Twitter Support&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417957446367252493">announcement</a>, the goal is to be able to gather enough data, so the platform can work on ways to surface more relevant responses. In long threads, for instance, the best replies don&#39;t always show up immediately and might be buried underneath tons of other people&#39;s tweets.</p><p>The random testers who get the feature might see different versions of it. Some may see upvote and downvote buttons, while others might only see a downvote button right next to Twitter&#39;s heart/like option. A third version will show testers thumbs up and down buttons instead. The number of downvotes a reply gets will not be visible to the public, and users&#39; downvotes will be visible to them alone. Meanwhile, upvotes will show up as likes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3ce4a8609cc1458f9320a8ef458cca17"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some key notes about this experiment:<br><br>1.

While the update isn’t flush with a litany of new features, these few changes make a world of difference for producers, musicians and DJs alike.</p><p>To record audio, you can use an external input or even just the internal microphone. This accommodates pros and entry level creators with little to no gear beyond the laptop. When recording, even in loop mode, your contiguous session is kept whole. This lets you try different versions of a guitar lick or vocals in a single take that you can trim down to the best segment later. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LismZjDhbRQ">edit the recordings</a> into clips, use different pieces throughout your project or even layer them in different keys for effect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Serato Studio 1.6 also keeps recordings in your library for use in other projects. You can sample vinyl directly into your project and by analyzing the file, it will instantly match them to your current BPM. There&#39;s  key detection for the recordings too, which can help keep your vocals on point.</p><p>Those using third-party apps or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s13_AzBq3EI&amp;list=PL0OwIw0MGXQMmEk5eRooUHIP_uvldZnPo">live-streaming</a> will be happy to know that you no longer need plug-ins to make the audio available to other apps. Serato now includes its own Virtual Audio Driver for input and output channels, and even works on Big Sur.</p><p>As always, Studio is great for those using Serato DJ and a controller, but now that audio recording has been added, it has the chops to stand on its own as a production tool. It&#39;s also very intuitive and opens up plenty of opportunities for creative expression without having to jump through hurdles in the process. New users can get tracks rolling in minutes (seriously) and pros can sketch out tracks or complete full projects quickly.</p><p>Serato Studio 1.6 is available to download today and, as always, there&#39;s a limited free version for you to test drive. To open up all the capabilities and access tons of sounds and samples, you can <a href="https://serato.com/studio/pricing">choose from</a> a $10 monthly subscription or buy it outright for $199 (including all updates for Version 1).</p><div id="0189e06955a34263888842cd69f3f1f0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0VA24jDFvM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/serato-studio-audio-recording-music-production-210009386.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">119acdc0-5a6b-4858-9bf5-f0ecaf5bf5e3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626893439</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T18:51:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cd8f9470-ea34-11eb-ac95-39e777ad2fb6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cd8f9470-ea34-11eb-ac95-39e777ad2fb6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Serato]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Producer Cor Don records vinyl directly into the Serato Studio app.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Serato Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC votes to fight back against right to repair restrictions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Trade Commission has voted unanimously to tackle unlawful repair restrictions. In a policy statement <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1592330/p194400repairrestrictionspolicystatement.pdf">published on Wednesday</a>, the agency said it plans to devote additional resources to enforcing existing laws, such as the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act</a>, that protect small businesses and consumers from companies that would prevent them from fixing on their own products they purchased. In doing so, the FTC will take a five-part approach to the problem that will involve it collecting comments and complaints from the public, as well as working more closely with state law enforcement and policymakers to update existing regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunity for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency,&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html">recently confirmed</a> FTC Chair Lina Khan said. &quot;The FTC has a range of tools it can use to root out unlawful repair restrictions, and today’s policy statement would commit us to move forward on this issue with new vigor.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The policy statement follows a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">July 9th executive order</a> in which President Biden directed the FTC to tackle &quot;unfair anti-competitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items&quot; imposed by &quot;powerful manufacturers&quot; in the farming and technology industries. With Wednesday&#39;s announcement, the FTC didn&#39;t name any specific companies it will target as part of any enforcement action. However, a company like Apple is likely to be top of mind for the agency. The tech giant has consistently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-19-tech-companies-are-trying-to-crush-mom-and-pop-repair-shops.html">lobbied against state-level right to repair legislation</a>, claiming those laws would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-apple-repair-costs.html">put consumers at risk</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right to repair advocates were quick to praise the announcement. &quot;The FTC sets the tone for the nation’s commerce. For too long, manufacturers have been bullying consumers and driving local repair shops out of business,&quot; iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51520/ftc-unanimously-approves-policy-of-fighting-repair-restrictions">blog post</a> the company published following the policy announcement. &quot;This landmark new policy changes that.

Post+ is a first step towards building a Tumblr for Gen Z, and what better way to support them than by getting them paid.&quot;</p><p>Tumblr plans to roll out Post+ broadly in the fall. It will keep five percent of subscription payments, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"><em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, with the rest going to bloggers.

Lapsed users who built a massive audience for their blogs back in the day might be tempted to return as well.</p><p>&quot;Not reserved only for professionals, or those with 10K followers or higher, Tumblr’s Post+ will push the boundaries of what’s considered money-making content on the internet: Shitposters, memelords, artists, fan fiction writers, all of the above and everyone in between will be able to create content while building their community of supporters, and getting paid with Post+,&quot; Tumblr said. &quot;With more than 48 percent of the platform being Gen Z we can&#39;t wait to see what they do with Post+.&quot;</p><p>Tumblr has endured some turbulence in recent years. Many users revolted after the platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-03-tumblr-blocking-adult-content-december-17th.html">banned</a> nudity and sexual content in late 2018. It made the decision soon after the iOS app vanished from the App Store following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-20-tumblr-pulled-app-store-child-exploitation.html">discovery of child exploitation on Tumblr</a>.</p><p>Monthly page views dipped by almost a third in the months after the porn ban, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/?tpcc=ECTW2020"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.

All you have to do is tap the banner to see the text in your native tongue. With today’s launch, the feature can translate text between more than 90 languages — though it doesn’t work with audio at the moment. Inevitably that means they’ll be Stories where you might not understand what someone is saying. Still, it’s a step toward making Instagram as inclusive as possible. People can also take advantage of Instagram’s recently added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-captions-172051963.html">auto-captioning feature</a> to get around the current translation limitation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-translate-text-stories-160008406.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e52027e-5617-4948-b087-93f07e44282c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626880589</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T15:16:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games buys 3D asset platform Sketchfab]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a> seems determined to give developers everything they need to make games in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tribeca-epic-games-unreal-engine-workshops-indie-filmmakers-182840472.html"><ins>Unreal Engine</ins></a> without having to look elsewhere for parts.

That&#39;s what I&#39;m wondering after seeing the company&#39;s next batch of titles: <em>Claymates</em>, <em>Jelly Boy</em> and <em>Bombuzal, </em>which are scheduled to arrive on July 28th. No offense to Interplay&#39;s <em>Clay</em> series (which includes the far more memorable <em>Clayfighter</em>), but these aren&#39;t titles I&#39;m exactly hankering to dive into. While Nintendo has done a solid job of bringing some of the biggest first-party titles over to Switch Online&#39;s SNES library, we&#39;re still waiting for classics like <em>Mario RPG</em> and <em>EarthBound </em>to arrive.&nbsp;</p><div id="ccb523425e5546119b44e348e1e407fd"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etAN0o4LVT0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s some value in letting younger generations see the sort of titles &#39;90s kids had to suffer through, though.

But they tend to leave out the part where you’re scrounging every dollar for textbooks, food and (if you’re lucky) the occasional weekend outing with friends. Money is tight when you’re a student, and that financial stress can be compounded by the reality of having to stay on top of your studies.</p><p>If there’s a silver lining, it’s student discounts. Many companies offer their products and services for less to those struggling through lectures, writing research papers and studying for finals. We’ve compiled a list of the best deals you can get on useful services, along with some things you’ll enjoy in your down time. Just keep in mind that most of these offers require you to prove your status as a student either by signing up with your .edu email address or providing some form of student identification.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Shopping</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb687390-df50-11eb-bf6f-1b79061e9ed1" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>Amazon Prime Student</h3><p>If you’re not piggybacking off of your parents’ Amazon Prime account, you can have the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:subscription" href="https://amzn.to/3wTJAgn">subscription</a> for less while you’re in school. College students can get Prime Student for $6.50 per month or $60 per year, and it includes the same perks as a standard Prime membership including free two-day shipping, free same-day delivery in select areas, and access to the entire Prime Video library. Amazon also currently offers a six-month free trial, so you’ll pay even less during your first year.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Prime Student at Amazon - $60/year" href="https://amzn.to/3wTJAgn">Buy Prime Student at Amazon - $60 a year</a></p><h3>Best Buy</h3><p>While it doesn’t offer a specific student discount, Best Buy has <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Student Deals" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/QOJQmx">Student Deals</a> that you can sign up to receive. Aside from proving your student status, the only requirement is for you to be a My Best Buy member; that program is free to enroll in. We actually recommend that most people sign up for My Best Buy because some items, especially during site-wide sales, will be even cheaper for members. All student deals will appear in the Member Offers page in your account.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Sign up for Student Deals at Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/QOJQmx">Sign up for Student Deals at Best Buy</a></p><h3>Apple</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Apple" href="https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/back-to-school">Apple</a> offers some deals to students and educators. This year in particular, Apple is throwing in a free pair of AirPods when you buy select Macs or iPads for college. You’ll get AirPods with the regular wired charging case free, or you can upgrade to AirPods with the wireless charging case for $40 more. Alternatively, you can get the AirPods Pro for $90 more. Apple knows how popular AirPods are and it clearly wants to sweeten the deal for students who have been thinking about getting a new computer before heading off to college.</p><p>The AirPods promotion also includes Apple education pricing on Macs and iPads. There isn’t a flat percentage rate across all products; the discounts are device dependent. For example, right now students can get a new MacBook Air M1 starting at $899, which is $100 less than the normal starting price (Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:matching this price" href="https://amzn.to/3zkFsqZ">matching this price</a>, too). The 13-inch MacBook Pro also starts off $100 cheaper and the new iPad Pros start at $749, or $50 cheaper than usual. These are decent savings if you must have a brand new Apple product, but those with tighter budgets should also consider Apple’s refurb program.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Shop Apple&#x002019;s back-to-school promos" href="https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop/back-to-school">Shop Apple’s back-to-school promos</a></p><h3>Samsung</h3><p>Samsung offers up to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:10 percent off" href="https://fave.co/3peP9na">10 percent off</a> most of its products to students and educators. The brand also has some decent offers like a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:" href="https://fave.co/3iB3E1s">&quot;speed and storage&quot; bundle</a> that includes two Samsung drives for under $300. We’d recommend stretching that 10 percent discount as much as possible by using it on big-ticket items like a Samsung laptop or a Galaxy smartphone if you need one. Otherwise, Samsung has solid accessories like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy SmartTag" href="https://fave.co/3dxyHtO">Galaxy SmartTag</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Watch Active 2" href="https://fave.co/3BB6SLo">Galaxy Watch Active 2</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Shop Samsung&#x002019;s back-to-school promos" href="https://fave.co/3peP9na">Shop Samsung’s back-to-school promos</a></p><h3>Microsoft</h3><p>Microsoft also provides students and educators with up to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:10 percent off" href="https://fave.co/3vPkijy">10 percent off</a> its gadgets, including the already affordable Surface Go 2 and the Surface Headphones 2.

Besides access to millions of songs, it also includes Hulu’s ad-supported plan and Showtime’s ad-free service. You’d spend roughly $27 a month if you paid for all three separately at their full prices, making this student offer one of the best you can get.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Spotify Premium Student - $5/month" href="https://www.spotify.com/us/student/">Buy Spotify Premium Student - $5 a month</a></p><h3>Pandora</h3><p>Pandora also offers students its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Premium membership" href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium/student">Premium membership</a> for $5 per month. Pandora’s offering doesn’t include any additional services, but you do get an ad-free experience, personalized music, unlimited skips and unlimited offline play.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Pandora Premium Student- $5/month" href="https://www.pandora.com/upgrade/premium/student">Buy Pandora Premium Student- $5 a month</a></p><h3>Apple Music</h3><p>Apple also slashes 50 percent off its <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928">Apple Music</a> subscription for students, bringing it down to $5 per month. The offer is available for up to 48 months so you can enjoy the rate for the entirety of your college experience. What’s more, the company bundles Apple TV+ in this student offer, so you can watch Apple originals like The Morning Show and See.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Apple Music Student membership - $5/month" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT205928">Buy Apple Music Student membership - $5 a month</a></p><h3>Tidal</h3><p>Tidal provides <a href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002669818-Student-Discount">student discounts</a> on both of its streaming services: Premium and Hi-Fi. Premium drops to $5 per month, down from $10, while Hi-Fi costs $10 per month, down from $20. This year, the company is offering a <a href="https://fave.co/2USwiTW">three-month free trial</a> of either of its services to any new user through the end of August. Tidal is still often overshadowed by Spotify and Apple Music, but these discounts are a good way to give it a try without spending too much money.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Tidal Student starting at $10/month" href="https://support.tidal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002669818-Student-Discount">Buy Tidal Student starting at $10 a month</a></p><h3>Hulu</h3><p>College students can sign up for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hulu&#x002019;s ad-supported plan" href="https://fave.co/3pgvrHu">Hulu’s ad-supported plan</a> for only $2 per month. That’s $4 less than the normal price and a great deal considering all of the content that Hulu has to offer (think <em>The Handmaid’s Tale, Grey’s Anatomy, Rick &amp; Morty</em> and more). Yes, you have to deal with commercials, but it’s a small price to pay to binge-watch shows like <em>Brooklyn Nine Nine,</em> which can provide a much-needed laugh when you’re drowning in coursework.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Hulu (ad-supported) - $2/month" href="https://fave.co/3pgvrHu">Buy Hulu (ad-supported) - $2 a month</a></p><h3>YouTube</h3><p>If you’re already spending a lot of time watching YouTube, you may have a better experience with YouTube Premium. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium/student">The Student plan</a> knocks nearly 50 percent off the price so you’ll pay $7 per month for ad-free video viewing, background play, video downloads and access to YouTube Premium Music. The latter is YouTube’s attempt at a Spotify/Apple Music competitor, but it has a long way to go before it can really hold a candle to those services.

In addition to a large library of meditation lessons and routines to follow, Headspace recently added SleepCasts, a collection of soothing voices reading bedtime stories to help you fall asleep, as well as “mindful” workout routines.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Buy Headspace Student plan - $10/year" href="https://www.headspace.com/studentplan">Buy Headspace Student plan - $10 a year</a></p><h2>Tools</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb67d750-df50-11eb-abff-6e8b2b38d1cd" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h3>Adobe Creative Cloud</h3><p>You’re probably using <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Adobe products" href="https://bit.ly/34NfsaF">Adobe products</a> if you’re studying anything to do with digital art or design.

Thankfully, Adobe has education pricing for students that drops the entire creative suite to $20 per month for the first year. That includes the big programs like Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC along with Lightroom CC, Premiere Pro CC, Adobe XD and more.</p><p>After your first year, the monthly cost increases to $30 per month. While not ideal, it’s still more affordable for students than it is for industry professionals. If you’re not tied to Adobe programs, you might also consider <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/">Affinity Photo</a>, <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/">Designer</a> and <a href="https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/publisher/">Publisher</a> apps from Serif ($50 each for the Mac or Windows versions), which compete with Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Buy Adobe CC - $20/month" href="https://bit.ly/34NfsaF">Buy Adobe CC - $20 a month</a></p><h3>Ableton Live</h3><p>Regardless of whether you’re studying music production, students can get <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/education/">40 percent off Ableton Live</a> Standard or Suite for as long as they are enrolled full-time.

Like, <em>really</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/aliens-fireteam-cold-iron-announcement-online-shooter-150024353.html"><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is an online, co-op, third-person survival shooter from Cold Iron Studios, and it’s been in development for the past six years. Cold Iron was actually bought and sold four times starting in 2018, bringing its mysterious Alien-based game along for the ride. In the end, Cold Iron has cut a deal with 20th Century Studios to self-publish <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, and it’s due to hit Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles on August 24th, priced at $40.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7b5d30-e9a6-11eb-b556-e013e611f324" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="d24fe6dd-afdf-30d2-ad05-ad97cd1ee80b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>I had the chance to play a preview build of <em>Fireteam Elite</em> that included access to two of the four campaigns, and four of the five character classes: gunner, technician, demolisher and doc (the final class is recon). Each campaign consists of three missions filled with AI-powered Xenomorph hordes, with three difficulty levels unlocked from the start. Every mission requires three players, and empty team slots are filled by bots named Alpha and Beta, which honestly end up functioning more like mobile turrets than actual teammates.</p><p>So, after playing hours of the preview with friends and bots alike, here’s my conclusion: <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em> is a generic survival shooter with old-school arcade DNA. <em>Fireteam Elite</em> feels like an online, updated version of light-gun games like <em>Area 51</em> or <em>House of the Dead</em>, complete with repetitive environments and sloppy hit boxes. The game is competent, but not dynamic. To put it simply — man, it’s <em>just </em>a shooting gallery down there.</p><p>To be fair, that’s what survival shooters are all about. Enter a new area, prepare your defenses, kill the swarm, rinse and repeat. The thing is, <em>Fireteam Elite</em> deploys this formula in such a rigid structure that missions quickly become predictable, no matter how many bugs show up. What’s more, the generic sci-fi environments blend together after a few playthroughs, and tricks like falling ceiling panels and sudden bursts of steam lose their effectiveness well before the first mission is over.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6eb7a0c029074a3780b16f9ce49e0a51" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7a72d1-e9a6-11eb-b791-6b6592190957" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite"></section><p><em>Fireteam Elite</em> fails to build tension. With such a transparent gameplay structure, any feeling of pressure or horror has to come from the xenomorphs themselves, and frankly, they’re often not smart enough to make this happen. The swarms rarely feel unmanageable and the specialized xenomorphs, like spitters or jumpers, routinely behave in non-threatening ways. This unpredictability ends up being more adorable than scary. Plus, I have to note that my game crashed three times in about seven hours of play.</p><p>That’s not to say the AI is trash altogether. Cold Iron says it’s already resolved some of the movement issues the xenomorphs were experiencing in the preview build, and it really is impressive to see dozens of inky black aliens bounding down the hallway, each on its own path but out for blood, and the game is built around these moments. The xenos stumble around corners like dogs on a tile floor, and details like this add much-needed personality to the waves.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f270-7ae8-11eb-b97f-c1ae18e3ae0b" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="721e2881-005d-307a-9d13-35e488a4b2a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>The game’s most exciting moments come at the end of each mission, during the final swarm. These are long standoffs with waves of xenomorphs, including spitters, prowlers, bursters and giants that hunt down a single crew member at a time. I’ve found the technician and doc to be particularly useful in these moments — the technician has a turret that recharges after it’s been destroyed and shock grenades to keep the xenomorphs at bay, while the doc has an incredibly handy healing circle.</p><p>This is where the most strategizing takes place, even if it is mostly just turret talk. There are chests containing consumable weapons, health and on-demand ammo refills at each final battle, meaning your whole team will start off well-equipped and they’re free to spray and pray. This is good, considering the reticles on most of the weapons are generous, and crowd control is the name of the game, not accuracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f271-7ae8-11eb-bf7f-d3069f06eed0" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="bf2d1cc1-ba96-3faa-9f88-c9d2c8b897e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>There are a few bright spots in <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>. The soundtrack is a James Horner-inspired orchestral situation and it’s a constant reminder of the game’s cinematic 1980s roots; it does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to setting the mood. Plus, the game’s RPG elements — including character, loadout and weapon customization, and challenge cards — add a necessary layer of depth to otherwise straightforward missions.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting <em>Fireteam Elite</em> to be as narrative-driven as the films or as moody as <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, but I had hoped for something like Left 4 Dead meets Dead Space, and this ain’t that. Instead, <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite </em>feels like a theme park ride in video game form. The monsters aren’t really threatening, but the crowds certainly are. And, of course, it’s more fun with friends.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-preview-video-140044958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">167c860f-e346-47e6-b9c0-279c72f315c6</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626858691</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:11:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7a72d1-e9a6-11eb-b791-6b6592190957" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7ae800-e9a6-11eb-ac17-204554e61094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[20th Century Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aliens: Fireteam Elite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aliens: Fireteam Elite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to watch the Tokyo Olympics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a year-long delay due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the games of the XXXII Olympiad are scheduled to begin in Tokyo this week. Despite <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/host-city-tokyo-enters-fresh-coronavirus-emergency-games-near-2021-07-12/">Japan’s struggles</a> to contain the virus and <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/tokyo-olympics-live-updates/2021/07/19/1018045639/despite-positive-covid-cases-team-usa-ceo-says-athletes-are-ready-to-compete">athletes testing positive</a> inside the Olympic Village, the event is still on. The sheer amount of action happening every day through the first week of August means you’ll need to plan ahead to catch all of the events you want to see, especially if you’re on the opposite side of the world.</p><h2><strong>When do the Olympics start?</strong></h2><p>The official start to the Olympics is the opening ceremony on Friday, July 23rd at 7AM ET, but a few events will actually kick off before that. The softball and women’s soccer competitions begin Wednesday (Tokyo time), but the first games aired Tuesday night on the east coast. Softball, men’s soccer and rowing are set to take place on Thursday with rowing, cycling, tennis and women’s water polo scheduled after the Opening Ceremony Friday and into Saturday. This weekend is when things really get going, though, with a packed slate of events from Saturday onward. The closing ceremony will air at 8PM ET on NBC on Sunday, August 8th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>How to watch</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/726fb050-e9a5-11eb-8bad-72b3410bdb23" alt="Jul 5, 2021; East Hartford, Connecticut, USA; The United States midfielder Sam Mewis (3) in action defended against Mexico midfielder Nancy Antonio (16) during the first half during a USWNT Send-off Series soccer match at Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium.

The network’s current deal goes through 2032, so you won’t have to look around to find the games on new channels anytime soon. Due to the volume of events, NBC proper isn’t enough to show all of the action, so you can also find live coverage on NBCSN, USA, CNBC, Golf Channel and the Olympic Channel — cable or TV streaming subscription required. Following controversy over tape delays during previous Olympics, NBC began airing events live in 2012 despite the massive time differences. During prime time in the US, the network will show highlights from earlier in the day in addition to any live action.</p><p>At least a portion of the marquee events — including the opening/closing ceremonies, the women’s soccer final, basketball, track &amp; field — will air on NBC. A lot of the events that take place in the middle of the night Eastern time (which is the bulk of the action) will be shown on the other networks and <a href="https://fave.co/3cesCla">NBC’s streaming service Peacock</a>. NBC Sports announced that Peacock will be home to “major events live each morning” including women’s and men’s gymnastics, track &amp; field and basketball. The streaming service will also have six themed channels alongside three highlight shows throughout the day Eastern time along with a spotlight series that focuses on the women of Team USA. Olympics coverage will be available for free on Peacock with the exception of men’s basketball. You’ll need a $4.99 subscription to watch those games.</p><p>If you’d rather watch from your computer, phone or tablet, NBC says “every single event” will be available through NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app. Twitch will also serve up Olympics content, but not live events. There, you’ll find interviews, highlights and, of course, competitions. The platform will also host streams and co-streams with Twitch creators during some of the primetime broadcasts.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b709f1d0-e9a5-11eb-b6af-6f73c4de0fea" alt="Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Table Tennis Training - Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Tokyo, Japan - July 20, 2021 General view of athletes during training REUTERS/Thomas Peter" data-uuid="89bcdda6-898a-3b07-a46a-098fc9f8abde"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Thomas Peter / reuters</div></figure><p>Several services and TV providers offer tools to help you keep up with all of the action. YouTube TV, for example, allows you to select which events you’re interested in and the app will automatically record them to its cloud DVR. Here’s to watching swimming at a normal hour and not staying up until 2AM. YouTube TV has also added a medal table for quick reference and its “Jump To” feature lets you hop around events and specific moments easily. Cable providers <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-olympic-games-xfinity-customers-x1-flex-and-stream">like Comcast</a> (owned by NBC’s parent company) are offering Olympics hubs on their services for easy access. There’s a degree of personalization across Xfinity tiers, for example, as well as notifications about “must-see moments” and playlists of highlights.</p><p>For a full schedule, <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/schedule">visit NBCOlympics.com</a> to find info on all of the events you’re looking for.</p><p>Fans in the UK don’t have to contend with quite the time difference as those of us in the States, but they’ll still get to watch as much of the action as they want. The BBC is the official broadcaster in the UK and it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/57597043">promising over 350 hours of coverage</a> through early August. BBC One and BBC Two will show live events while an additional livestream will be available on BBC iPlayer. The network will have daily highlights and recap shows in both the morning and evening with anything that airs on BBC One or Two available on-demand via iPlayer. Coverage is also available through BBC Radio 5 Live and The Olympics Daily podcast.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-tokyo-olympics-134504180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e13f8e2-e5ed-40a8-ba39-6b81126eaff0</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:45:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626895929</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T19:32:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Summer Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pawel Kopczynski / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view of the Olympic Rings installed on a floating platform with the Rainbow Bridge in the background in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan June 21, 2021.

Gaming notebooks are lighter, more powerful and cheaper than ever before. They&#39;re particularly useful for students because their beefy hardware could be helpful for rendering video and doing any other schoolwork that would make super-thin ultraportables sweat. You can find some general advice on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">choosing gaming laptops in our guide</a>. In this piece, you&#39;ll find a few selections specifically geared towards school use.</p><h2>Are gaming laptops good for college?</h2><p>As stated above, gaming laptops are especially helpful if you&#39;re doing any demanding work. Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn&#39;t just limited to games. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle especially demanding tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity laptops, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Dell&#39;s XPS 15" href="https://bit.ly/3A4C8Sb">Dell&#39;s XPS 15</a>, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse machine: Get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find. Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we&#39;d recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is a significantly more than three-pound ultraportables. Today&#39;s gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won&#39;t be lugging around a 10-pound brick. Also, if you&#39;re not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).</p><h2>Best midrange for most people: ASUS Zephyrus G15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6c703fb0-ea24-11eb-af5f-663ae06b840e" alt="Back to School - ASUS Zephyrus G15" data-uuid="f5191389-e401-3595-b1a4-f299ff8055c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / ASUS</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Zephryus G15" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Zephryus G15</a> has all the power you&#39;d want in a gaming laptop, at a price that&#39;s more reasonable than higher-end options. It&#39;s a slightly larger follow-up to last year&#39;s favorite for this category (the G14), but there&#39;s still lots to love. The G15 features AMD&#39;s latest Ryzen 5000 processors, along with NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3000 GPUs. And, judging from our benchmarks, it manages to make good use of all that power. It also has a fast 165Hz 1440p screen, which is ideal for playing games at high framerates. The G15 doesn&#39;t have a webcam, but its solid specs and performance more than make up for that.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850</a></p><h2>Best high-end option: Razer Blade 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92070d30-ea24-11eb-b79f-af7fe937acf3" alt="Back to School - Razer Blade 15" data-uuid="1c239297-3262-3911-9719-4537d22f412e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>For years, Razer has staked a reputation for building gaming laptops that look as good as MacBooks.

If money is no object, you can equip the Blade 15 with Intel&#39;s latest 11th-gen processors, NVIDIA&#39;s powerful RTX 3080 and either a 240Hz QHD or 360Hz HD screen.</p><p>While you&#39;ll pay a bit more for the Blade 15 compared to some other models, you&#39;ve still got a few different price points to work with. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:entry-level model starts at $1,699" href="https://fave.co/2UCoWUa">entry-level model starts at $1,699</a> with an RTX 3060 GPU and 144Hz 1080p display.

That opens up a near desktop-level of multitasking, since you can have windows spread across both screens. That could be useful for browsing the web and keeping an eye on Twitter at the same time. (Or, perhaps squeezing in a game of <em>Overwatch</em> while following an online lecture on the other screen.
