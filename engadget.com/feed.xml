The <em>Associated Press</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-race-and-ethnicity-racial-injustice-artificial-intelligence-2fe8d3ef7008d299d9d810f0c0f7905d">notes</a> the city&#39;s council has <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4344524&amp;GUID=B051915D-A9AC-451E-81F8-6596032FA3F9">passed</a> a bill barring AI hiring systems that don&#39;t pass yearly audits checking for race- or gender-based discrimination. Developers would also need greater transparency (including disclosures of automated systems), and provide alternatives like human reviews. Fines would reach up to $1,500 per incident.</p><p>The bill was passed November 10th. Departing Mayor Bill de Blasio has a month to sign it into law, but hasn&#39;t said whether or not he will.

Pro-business organizations like the Greater New York Chamber of Commerce are already in favor, suggesting the disclosures are vital for both employers and their talent.</p><p>However, there are already concerns an enacted law wouldn&#39;t help as much as promised. The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology&#39;s Alexandra Givens told the <em>AP</em> the bill doesn&#39;t account for other biases, such as ableism or ageism. This also assumes the audits are effective — New York University&#39;s Julia Stoyanovich argued the requirements were &quot;very easy to meet.&quot; There&#39;s a concern the legislation might inadvertently shield employers whose AI platforms have different or harder-to-detect biases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nyc-city-council-ai-hiring-tool-ban-225314717.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1b828b3-1585-4737-88ca-8bdde53eb7fb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 22:53:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637448796</ingested><modified>2021-11-20T22:53:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0d6673e0-4a50-11ec-9bbf-5027f6ae1d10" width="9128" height="5477" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0d6673e0-4a50-11ec-9bbf-5027f6ae1d10" width="10417" height="6250" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[claudenakagawa via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ai,business]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Personnel evaluation by artificial intelligence,blue background,vector illustration]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Podcasts app ratings flip after the company starts prompting users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-allows-rating-first-party-app-store-apps-230528659.html">allow ratings for its own apps</a> is producing... mixed results.

As you might have guessed, though, this wasn&#39;t the results of a (non-existent) feature update during that period. Rather, the blame appears to rest on app prompts and more than a little confusion.</p><p>The iPhone maker told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">iOS 15.1</a> started prompting users for ratings and reviews &quot;just like most third-party apps.&quot; However, many people thought they were rating the show they were listening to, not the app — and that led to a flood of scores and reviews for podcasts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This issue hasn&#39;t affected many other first-party apps, such as Apple Maps (2.8 stars as of this writing).

At the same time, though, the mixups are inflating Podcasts&#39; value and rendering the scores useless for many people deciding on podcast clients. The shift also underscores the problem with trusting ratings and reviews regardless of platform. It&#39;s still relatively easy for misguided users, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-palestinian-activists-facebook-app-rating-protest-211008340.html">activists</a> and fraudsters to skew that feedback.</p><div id="f9d9a30d81dd41219c859a384529769b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: <a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3">pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3</a></p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-app-review-score-prompts-215857401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a03308b1-595c-4c9e-8bd2-9b4a2caa3fa9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 21:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637445539</ingested><modified>2021-11-20T21:59:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Podcast application is seen on an Apple iPad on October 24, 2017.

First, Mat Smith checked out the new SharePlay feature on iOS 15.1 and determined it has potential. Next, Billy Steele listened to the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones and found them to be just as comfortable as their predecessors, and with improved noise cancellation, too. Nathan Ingraham put the HP Chromebook X2 to the test and found the lightweight laptop has a stellar screen that’s ideal for travel. Steve Dent turned the dial on ASUS’s ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED laptop, which he says has an exceptionally color accurate screen and thoughtful features for creatives. Finally, Terrence O’Brien made a few stickers and decals with the Cricut Explore 3.</p><h2>iOS 15.1 rolls out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">new SharePlay feature</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cd60a720-4969-11ec-bef3-d5f411982434" alt="Apple iOS 15.1" data-uuid="b3a19b3e-7790-3e4e-baa1-4608cdb299f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Mat Smith calls iOS 15.1 a relatively minor update when compared to the more drastic changes brought by iOS 14. A good bulk of the additions here come from the release of SharePlay, which allows you to do things like stream TV shows with a friend over FaceTime. Mat said that the shows were lag free in testing, the fitness apps were motivating and the free games were more fun than he expected. However, SharePlay isn’t available for all apps — for instance, YouTube and Netflix are not supported right now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mat also tested spatial audio, which gives callers directional sound, but he was more impressed by the new voice isolation and wide modes. He also played around with Focus modes, which help you track and limit your screen time via profiles and the ability to “lock” yourself out of your phone for set periods of time. Mat points out that these features, in addition to the machine learning improvements with Visual Look-up and Live Text, show that Apple is rededicating itself towards sharing.</p><h2>HP’s Chromebook X2 makes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-chromebook-x2-review-162005261.html">a great first impression</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7b0ddd70-496a-11ec-bc57-06274e606c55" alt="HP Chromebook X2" data-uuid="cc7b511e-ba38-3df1-ac59-b96320056fe2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham found the hardware on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">HP Chromebook X2</a> to be well built, sturdy and simple in design. He called the bright 11-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 touchscreen a standout that made work feel less cramped thanks in part to its 3:2 aspect ratio. The keyboard was responsive with good travel, and he liked that the included stylus attached neatly and magnetically to the side. When it came to performance, he found the X2 to do well for watching videos, browsing the web and playing games.</p><p>However, he found the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c mobile processor struggled when it came time to push the machine with intensive tasks. Though he was able to run his usual programs, it wasn’t the fastest experience and he said he avoided playing music from the device while running a lot of other apps because it would cause slowdowns. That being said, its stellar battery life, size and lightweight design make the Chromebook X2 a solid secondary or travel device.</p><h2>The ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html">laptop for creatives</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a977e250-496a-11ec-8be5-ce2e9acfd640" alt="ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED" data-uuid="c51a6c48-bed2-37de-8a31-dbd71038ad3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook</a> is clearly intended to woo artists and creatives with its fast performance, gorgeous 16-inch 4K OLED screen and the “ASUS dial” for video and photo editing. The screen is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, and has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky blacks that make it good for content creation and streaming entertainment. It also features an “IceCool Pro” thermal solution to boost airflow while keeping noise levels minimal. Steve found this to hold true during testing, except for very GPU/CPU intensive tasks, which did bump up the noise levels.</p><p>He was also particularly impressed with the dial, which he says feels nice with a textured grip and smooth rotation. The location is convenient and the dial can be used to adjust volume or display brightness as well as to access menu options from four Adobe apps. Steve was also pleased with the number of ports on the machine, including a USB-C with DisplayPort support and an SD Express card slot. In testing, the laptop performed well during both gaming and editing tasks, thanks in part to a RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 CPU. On top of that, Steve found it had a solid battery life, too, which lead him to declare the Studiobook 16 the best Windows 10 laptop for content creation.</p><h2>Bose makes minor but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">appreciated updates</a> with the QuietComfort 45 headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f9ecf5e0-496a-11ec-976b-610c6b36e5c0" alt="Bose QuietComfort 45" data-uuid="10c057d0-fbdf-36db-a3e5-06805c781eba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele isn’t disappointed that Bose didn’t update the design of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:QuietComfort 45" href="https://amzn.to/3csDpIf">QuietComfort 45</a> headphones. In fact, he was pleased that the company kept so much of what made the previous model popular, from the light weight to the physical buttons and cushiony pads. He reports that the new headphones keep the sound quality that Bose is known for, with crisp highs, robust mids and deep bass. The QC45 sounded good across multiple genres and the updated noise cancelling removed more background sounds than the last model.</p><p>New to the QC45 is an ambient sound or aware mode, which allows you to hear what’s happening around you. Billy said it’s serviceable but not the best he’s experienced. While testing, he managed to get 22.5 hours worth of playback before he needed to recharge the headphones. However, he did find the multi-device connectivity a bit frustrating as it required him to reconnect after ending a call. Overall, he still feels that the newest QuietComfort cans offer a lot for folks who travel frequently and need a comfortable set of headphones with exceptional noise cancelling capabilities.</p><h2>Cricut’s Explore 3 cutting machine is for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html">devoted crafters</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6cd6650-496b-11ec-b7ce-a0eba766a7dd" alt="Circuit Explore 3" data-uuid="340d0376-7646-3315-8981-6f93bf9be0b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits he’s not the core audience for a Circuit craft machine.

Workman Publishing © 2021</p><hr><p>Aside from putting barriers between us and plagues, the next primary approach to defeating them was to attack them directly, thanks to breakthroughs in science that created and discovered antibiotics and antitoxins. Some of these medicines aren’t simply employed against microorganisms like bacteria, but act as antifungals, antivirals, and antiparasitics as well. Today, there are more than a hundred types of medicines in this group. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of medicines deemed essential for a country’s healthcare system to best care for its citizenry, and a large chunk of those essential meds battle infectious diseases.</p><p>Some might assume that penicillin was the first definitive weapon discovered in our fight against pathogens, but there were several that preceded it and broke significant ground when they were discovered.</p><p>The Prussian-born Emil von Behring was a doctor and an assistant to the famed Robert Koch at the Institute for Hygiene in Berlin. In 1888, he developed a way to treat those suffering from diphtheria and tetanus. Not a disease familiar to many these days, diphtheria is prevented by a vaccine that is usually coupled with your routine tetanus shot. In the 1800s, diphtheria was a terrible killer that inflamed a victim’s heart, inflicted paralysis, and caused a suffocating membrane to cover the throat. In Spain, the disease was so rampant in 1613 it was nicknamed <em>El Año de los Garrotillos</em>, or “The Year of Strangulations.”</p><p>Much of the disease caused by diphtheria is driven by the toxin created by <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>. Von Behring infected rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs with weakened (attenuated) forms of it, then gathered their serum—the liquid fraction of their blood, minus the red and white blood cells. That light, honey-colored liquid, which contained antibodies to the diphtheria toxin, was then injected into another set of animals that were sickened with fully virulent diphtheria bacteria.</p><p>The newly infected animals given the serum didn’t die because they gained a passive form of protection against the toxin with the donated serum. In 1891, a child’s life was saved using this new method for the first time. The serum was produced in large quantities using animals like sheep and horses. At a time when 50,000 children died annually from diphtheria, it was a miraculous treatment.</p><p>Tetanus serum was created soon after, becoming a workable treatment by 1915. Today, antitoxins are used to treat botulism, diphtheria, and anthrax. The same principles of antitoxin treatment are utilized for antivenom therapy to remedy poisonous animal bites, including those from black widow spiders, scorpions, box jellyfish, and cobras. A treatment called passive antibody therapy, in which the serum of patients recovered from an infection is given to other sick patients (also called convalescent plasma therapy), may have been helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic, though data is still forthcoming. Antibodies against infections can not only treat diseases like toxic shock syndrome, but prevent infections during exposures, such as those for hepatitis A and B and botulism. But the antibodies themselves have been employed to treat more than just bites, stings, and infections. Intravenous immunoglobulins from pooled donors treat a variety of disorders, such as ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) and severe immune deficiency diseases.</p><p>Another antibody therapy—monoclonal antibodies—has been a game-changer in treatments over the last decade or so, the first one approved by the FDA in 1986. These specially designed antibodies are used to treat several types of cancers (melanoma, breast, and stomach, among many others) and autoimmune diseases (including Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis). The antibodies themselves are Y-shaped proteins that bind to a specific protein. In doing so, they can elicit a whole range of effects: switching on or off immune system cascades, destroying cells, blocking or engaging cell activities. The antibodies only bind to a single antigen, hence “mono,” and are produced by clones of cells that churn out the antibodies in large amounts. Sometimes they can also be bound to radioactive particles, delivering radioactivity directly to a cancer cell. Others can be bound to a chemotherapy agent. Often, they work alone.</p><p>In the realm of cancer therapy, most of us have some understanding of chemotherapy. But the origin of the term chemotherapy itself actually came from the fight to treat infections, not cancer. At the turn of the twentieth century, antibiotics had yet to establish themselves as a cure for infections. That changed with a physician and scientist named Paul Ehrlich. He was born in 1854 in East Prussia (now Poland) where his father ran a lottery office. During his career, he took advantage of the burgeoning German dye industry to experiment on how cells looked stained with different chemicals. His love of color led to some notable idiosyncrasies, like carrying colored pencil stubs in his pockets. But Ehrlich’s work led to what would become the famous Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain for tuberculosis. (Unfortunately, he also stained his very own TB bacteria from his sputum, though luckily survived the illness.) Later he collaborated with the aforementioned Emil von Behring, a Nobel Prize–winning physiologist, on serum therapy for tetanus and diphtheria.</p><p>But perhaps Ehrlich’s most notable discovery happened by accident as he sought a chemical cure to treat a specific disease—a “chemotherapy.” Specifically, he hoped to cure sleeping sickness, a disease caused by a microscopic parasite called <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>. He had been working with a chemical called atoxyl (meaning “nontoxic”), ironically an arsenic compound. Ehrlich coined the term “magic bullet” related to his hope of finding that perfect chemical that would hopefully kill a very specific pathogen, the <em>Trypanosoma</em> parasite, and not the patient. He ended up testing nine hundred variations of the arsenic compounds on mice. None were particularly effective, but he revisited #606 because it seemed to have an effect on a newly discovered bacterium believed to cause syphilis. In 1910, the medicine called Salvarsan (sometimes simply called “606”) was proven to be effective—it killed the syphilis spirochete and left the guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice alive.</p><p>In the next few decades, new research would be applied to battle not just the pandemics of old, but daily infections that could upend people’s lives. A scratch or bite could kill if those <em>Staphylococcus</em> or <em>Streptococcus</em> infections spiraled out of control. A German scientist named Gerhard Domagk began working with a group of chemicals called azo dyes that had a characteristic double nitrogen bond. Azo dyes can color textiles, leather, and foods various shades of brilliant orange, red, and yellow. When an azo compound had a sulfonamide group attached (a nitrogen and sulfur link with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the sulfur, should you need to impress friends at a party), they knew they’d found something special. The sulfonamide group inhibits a bacteria’s ability to make folate, a necessary B vitamin. Humans, on the other hand, can obtain folate through their diet. And so another magic bullet was born. The new compound seemed to work in mice infected with <em>Streptococcus</em>, otherwise known as strep.</p><p>Domagk used the new medicine, called KL 730 and later patented as Prontosil, on his own daughter Hildegard. Suffering from a severe strep infection, she received a shot of Prontosil and recovered, though the drug left a telltale dyed, reddish discoloration at the injection site.</p><p>“Sulfa” drugs would go on to be used in a variety of medicines, including antibiotics (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, aka Bactrim), diabetes medicines (glyburide, a sulfonylurea), diuretics (furosemide, or Lasix), pain meds (celecoxib, or Celebrex), and are also used today to treat pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections, among others.</p><p>Domagk’s work won him the Nobel Prize in 1935. However, the Nazis, who disapproved of how the Nobel committee tried to help German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, had their Gestapo arrest Domagk for accepting the prize and forced him to give it back. He was able to receive it later in 1947.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-patient-zero-lydia-kang-nate-pederson-workman-publishing-163030051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40a015b5-070e-4d01-856a-05325e42d549</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 16:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137102</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6d0ae90-3d1e-11ec-bbed-dcb96101f5dd" width="6942" height="4628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/91a25190-3d1e-11ec-bfd4-984b39658db5" width="5933" height="2696" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fahroni via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Colorful capsule pills in plastic box.

For those who&#39;ve been mostly dependent on their phones instead of their keycards, that means being locked out of their vehicles. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/19/tesla-suffers-nationwide-app-server-outage-owners-cant-connect-cars/"><em>Electrek</em></a> first reported the issue after receiving complaints from Tesla owners on Friday night, and for a while it seemed like the problem only affected drivers in North America.

The outage came shortly after the automaker rolled out an update to its application, which <em>Electrek</em> said includes a feature that Tesla had issues implementing. It&#39;s unclear if that was connected to the outage, since Musk has yet to follow up on his initial response. Regardless, it looks like the outage is starting to get resolved. <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/tesla/">Downdetector</a> received as many as 543 reports a few hours ago, but now they&#39;re down to less than a hundred.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Being locked out of vehicles could be an ongoing problem as automakers move to cloud services and increase reliance on smartphone apps.

It’s possible Disney anticipates whatever Hulu subscribers it loses will be worth an increase to its Disney+ customer base.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hulu-live-tv-disney-plus-bundle-price-hike-202004930.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75fefd79-99ac-411f-aabc-893eaa1f3c6d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 20:20:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637352495</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T20:08:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0541fc80-4973-11ec-b3fa-f92194262a5f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0541fc80-4973-11ec-b3fa-f92194262a5f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rockstar apologizes for broken GTA remasters and pledges to fix bugs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rockstar Games has apologized for the shoddy quality of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - Definitive Edition</ins></em></a><em>.</em> It plans to fix &quot;the unexpected technical issues&quot; and improve the three games in the collection.</p><p>&quot;We want to sincerely apologize to everyone who has encountered issues playing these games,&quot; <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th"><ins>the publisher said</ins></a>. &quot;The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect.&quot; The first update is scheduled to arrive in the coming days and it will &quot;address a number of issues.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c555a15b54ba42de982eebcde34cf1a6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">An update regarding the unexpected technical issues with Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition. <a href="https://t.co/YP4pkOLQmG">https://t.co/YP4pkOLQmG</a><a href="https://t.co/AsfYPuMI0d">pic.twitter.com/AsfYPuMI0d</a></p>— Rockstar Games (@RockstarGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1461744813448081413?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>It didn&#39;t take long for players to start sharing clips of bugs and glitches on social media after the remastered collection of <em>GTA III, GTA: Vice City </em>and <em>GTA: San Andreas </em>arrived last week. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-grand-theft-auto-3-definitive-edition-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly"><em><ins>Digital Foundry</ins></em></a> took a deep dive into <em>GTA III </em>and found there were &quot;issues that are so blatant and jarring and ridiculous, it&#39;s hard to understand how the game made its way through quality control.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s more, Rockstar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-trilogy-remaster-pulled-pc-rockstar-games-192133431.html"><ins>pulled the PC version</ins></a> of the bundle soon after launch to &quot;remove some data files that were unintentionally included in the new versions of these games&quot; (those are believed to include files related to the infamous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-17-gta-hot-coffee-controversy-summary.html"><em><ins>San Andreas </ins></em><ins>&quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mod</ins></a>).

In a complaint with the state’s Superior Court in Alameda County, Jessica Barraza, a production associate with Tesla, said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions over the past three years. Barraza’s lawsuit describes a factory floor that looks more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of advanced EV production.</p><p>Barraza’s allegations against Tesla are numerous. In one incident, the suit alleges a male co-worker stuck his leg between her thighs when she went to punch in after a lunch break. Amid the harassment, Barraza says her complaints fell on deaf ears. In one instance, she says a supervisor did nothing when she complained of a co-worker staring at her breasts. “Maybe you shouldn’t wear shirts that draw attention to your chest,” her supervisor told her, according to the suit. Barraza told the man she was “wearing a work shirt provided by Tesla.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“After almost three years of experiencing all the harassment, it robs your sense of security — it almost dehumanizes you,” Barraza said in an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/19/tesla-sexual-harassment/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, which was the first outlet to report on the suit. We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment. The company does not typically respond to media requests.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit comes one month after Tesla was ordered by a federal court to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">pay $137 million to a Black employee</a> who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at its Fremont factory.  “We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns,” the company said at the time. “Occasionally, we’ll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.” Tesla is appealing the award.</p><p>Tesla also isn’t the only EV-maker accused of fostering a toxic workplace for women. Just days before its IPO, Rivian was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">sued by Laura Schwab, one of its former executives</a>. In her lawsuit, Schwab alleges the automaker fired her after she complained of a “toxic ‘bro culture’” that saw her excluded from meetings and more. “The culture at Rivian was actually the worst I’ve experienced in over 20 years in the automotive industry,” Schwab said at the time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-sexual-harassment-suit-185934119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9aca2d5-639f-445a-b833-2c243cb35f2a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637349236</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T19:13:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla vehicle drives past Tesla's primary vehicle factory after CEO Elon Musk announced he was defying local officials' coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions by reopening the plant in Fremont, California, U.S. May 11, 2020.

The last decade-plus has seen Apple’s computers become essentially impossible for users to service or upgrade, and the iPhone has always been a locked box. Adventurous owners might follow <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928">guides from iFixit</a> to try and do repairs themselves, but it’s a dangerous proposition. Remember, it was just earlier this year, when we discovered that replacing the display on an iPhone 13 would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-face-id-third-party-replacement-215624361.html">disable Face ID</a>. (Apple later backpedaled on this.)</p><p>So Apple’s announcement earlier this week that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">start selling parts and tools directly to consumers </a>and offer repair guides was a huge surprise, and a move immediately hailed as a victory by right-to-repair activists. “One of the most visible opponents to repair access is reversing course,” <a href="https://mailchi.mp/9af21ee3e564/statement-apple-concedes-to-right-to-repair-movement-reverses-ban-on-selling-parts-to-consumers?e=767d7cbbfe">said Nathan Proctor</a>, a senior Right to Repair campaign director at Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG). “Apple’s move shows that what repair advocates have been asking for was always possible.” iFixit was similarly pleased, saying that the move is “exactly the right thing for Apple to be doing.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both groups caveated their statements by noting a few catches. PIRG says that Apple’s plans weren’t as comprehensive as the right-to-repair legislation being discussed in more than two dozen states, while iFixit wants to “analyze the legal terms and test the program” before it can say just how much credit Apple deserves. But regardless, it’s still a major about-face. So what led Apple to this move?</p><p>Proctor told Engadget in an email exchange that he thinks “combined pressure from consumers, regulators and shareholders has shifted Apple&#39;s thinking.” But he was also quick to point out that there was pressure coming from inside Apple itself. “We saw from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair">some leaked emails</a> from 2019 that many inside Apple never wanted to be hostile to repair in the ways that Apple has been at times,” he said. You probably saw that [Apple co-founder Steve] Wozniak called [out] the practices, but leaked emails show internal concern they were doing the wrong thing.”</p><p>Apple has made some other movies recently that show that potential government scrutiny and oversight could be driving change at the company. In 2020, Apple finally let users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">set different browser and email apps</a> as default on the iPhone and iPad, and Siri has gotten smarter about learning your preferences for different music apps when you ask it to play tunes.</p><p>While it’s likely that Apple is thinking about government pressure, this change might also simply be part of the company listening to its users and correcting some mistakes it made over the last five years or so. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">Take the new MacBook Pro</a>, perhaps the biggest “mea culpa” Apple has ever offered: The company reversed its trend of pursuing thin and light design at all costs and instead actually made the both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros thicker and heavier than their predecessors. The company also added back ports it had previously removed, killed the unpopular Touch Bar, and generally made a laptop that made it seem like they were listening to consumer feedback. The same could be said for its new home repair program.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/413d2f90-ca89-11e9-a1be-2ec8d17a9f7d" alt="A worker refurbishes an Apple Iphone cell phone at a workshop of the Oxflo company, specialised in refurbishment of broken European smartphones which will be resold and provided with a warranty as part of an eco-responsible approach, in Lusignac, France, June 20, 2019.

Obviously, this isn’t the same as making it easy for anyone to do repairs, but opening up access means the repair landscape for Apple products has changed significantly in the last few years.</p><p>However big of a change this new plan is, though, Proctor and PIRG see this as a first step, something Apple will need to keep up and expand to really deliver what right-to-repair activists think consumers deserve. “I think Right to Repair knows what it wants, and it will be really hard to convince us to settle for anything less than an open market for repair,” Proctor said. “If they had done this step years ago, maybe we would have to settle, but we have the momentum, and we are going to empower repair as much as we can. I think most legislators agree: This is just one company and a limited program. The floor got raised, but we aren&#39;t near the ceiling yet.”</p><p>iFixit has a similar view on the situation. “[Apple] pioneered glued-in batteries and proprietary screws, and now they are taking the first steps on a path back to long-lasting, repairable products. iFixit believes that a sustainable, repairable world of technology is possible, and hope that Apple follows up on this commitment to improve their repairability.”</p><p>As for what’s to come, it sounds like Apple is committed to making this just a first step. The company said that repair options would initially focus on commonly-repaired modules in the iPhone 12 and 13, like the screen, battery and cameras, but it says that more options will come in the following year. We don’t know if Apple will ever give right-to-repair activists everything they want. It seems unlikely that Apple will make an iPhone where you can just pop it open and drop a new battery in, like the phones of old.</p><p>Apple can often be a bellwether for the rest of the industry — just look how quickly other phone-makers dropped their headphone jacks. So, it’s possible we’ll see some other big consumer electronics companies make similar moves. “I think other companies will follow,” Proctor said. He also noted that Google had just released software that lets a replacement display on the Pixel 6 be properly calibrated to work with the in-screen fingerprint sensor.” We see a lot of changes in the works, and we are hopeful we can set a new baseline [for] access to repair.” If that happens, we’ll likely remember Apple’s about-face as a catalyst for these changes — assuming the company follows through with its new stance and makes it easier for owners to repair a wider variety of its products.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65b293b6-1e20-431e-88d8-a50d492b2a25</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637354117</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T20:35:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/325bd980-4959-11ec-bfd2-888ffdd2c055" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/325bd980-4959-11ec-bfd2-888ffdd2c055" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Why Apple changed its mind on Right to Repair]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus 9 Pro is $270 off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re looking for an alternative smartphone to an iPhone, Samsung handset or Pixel, you can&#39;t go far wrong with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a>.

The IP68-rated device has a 6.7-inch, 3,216 x 1,440 screen with brightness of up to 1,300 nits and a 120Hz maximum refresh rate.

Per the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article255941562.html"><em>Miami Herald</em></a>, city commissioners voted on Thursday to end a multi-year pilot that had allowed companies like Bird and Lime to operate shared scooter rentals within the city’s core. Those companies now have until 5PM on Friday, November 19th, to collect their electric scooters. If they don’t comply in time, the city will impound the vehicles.</p><p>“We’re shutting it down,” Commissioner Alex Díaz de la Portilla told the outlet. “That’s it.” Like in many other cities across the US and other parts of the world, electric scooters were a source of controversy in Miami. Supporters claimed they were an effective solution for last-mile travel, while detractors said they made city sidewalks unsafe. It’s that latter point of view that swayed the commission’s vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“On Biscayne Boulevard, at whatever hour of the day, you see kids on these scooters,” said Commissioner Díaz de la Portilla. “This is an accident waiting to happen.” Ken Russell, the lone commissioner who voted against ending the program, pointed out it had been a revenue generator for the city. Miami had earned approximately $2.4 million through the pilot program, and it had used that money to fund new bike lanes.</p><p>The vote caught the scooter companies off guard. “We’re extremely disappointed in the Commission’s hasty and short-sighted action to end the scooter program, taking away a safe and popular transportation option used by thousands of Miami residents daily and putting dozens of workers out of a job the week before Thanksgiving,” said Caroline Samponaro, vice president of transit, bike and scooter policy at Lyft, in a statement shared with Engadget.</p><p>As the <em>Miami Herald</em> points out, there is a chance scooters could return to Miami. City staff are drafting rules that would allow rental companies to bid for a contract to operate in the city as part of a permanent program. But based on the fact the Miami City Commission would need to vote to authorize such a program, it’s not clear if there’s enough support.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miami-ends-electric-scooter-pilot-program-165747077.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a06bd24-1cb2-4d74-b89b-d3976ab590d2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:02:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637341145</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T16:59:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6e5f3570-c377-11eb-bbf3-d188c20955cf" width="8560" height="5707" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6e5f3570-c377-11eb-bbf3-d188c20955cf" width="8560" height="5707" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nisian Hughes via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of South Beach Miami Florida cityscape with buildings along the beach on a beautiful sunny day, people on beach and ocean]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of South Beach Miami Florida cityscape]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bose's QuietComfort 45 headphones drop to $279, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re officially one week out from Black Friday and it seems most retailers have launched at least a portion of their deals and sales already.

A 12-month subscription to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ps%20plus/">PlayStation Plus</a> is currently <a href="https://amzn.to/3CA0e78">$40</a> on Amazon. It typically costs $60 and it&#39;s a digital code, so you won&#39;t have to wait for delivery. If you’re already a PS Plus member, it’s still worth checking out this deal, since you can stack additional subscriptions.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3CA0e78" id="f0ea60e3dbd74a35bc9949777e199555" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PS Plus (1 year) at Amazon - $40</a><p>You&#39;ll need a PS Plus membership to play most multiplayer games on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. There are exceptions for some free-to-play games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. In addition, members often get discounts on digital purchases through the PlayStation Store, as well as cloud storage and backups for game save files.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the major value adds of PS Plus is that players receive a mystery bag of a few games each month across PS4 and PS5. There are three extra PS VR games <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/28/playstation-plus-games-for-november-knockout-city-first-class-trouble-kingdoms-of-amalur-re-reckoning/">this month</a> to mark the headset’s fifth anniversary. You’ll retain access to claimed PS Plus games as long as you maintain your subscription.</p><p>PS5 owners can take advantage of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-free-games-210040338.html">the PS Plus Collection</a> too. It’s a selection of first-party and third-party PS4 games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ps5-optimization-patch-214349294.html">some of which</a> have been patched for better performance on PS5. The lineup includes <em>God of War</em>, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief&#39;s End</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, <em>Days Gone</em>, <em>Battlefield 1</em>, <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, <em>The Last Guardian</em>, <em>The Last of Us Remastered</em>, <em>Persona 5</em> and <em>Resident Evil 7</em>. The same rule applies: if your PS Plus subscription lapses, you won’t be able to play games you claimed through the collection.</p><p>Of course, given that this is the biggest shopping season of the year, there are discounts on games as well, and many of the better deals are for physical editions. You can find savings on PlayStation console exclusives like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a> (<a href="https://fave.co/30ByLVw">$25</a> at GameStop if you click &#39;New&#39; and <a href="https://amzn.to/30DrwwP">$30</a> at Amazon, usually $60), the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html">director&#39;s cut</a> of <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>on PS5 (down from $70 to <a href="https://amzn.to/3CxWQtM">$50</a>), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/demons-souls-ps5-remake-gameplay-trailer-212138725.html"><em>Demon&#39;s Souls</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(also reduced by $30 to <a href="https://amzn.to/3oGsH6x">$40</a>) and, in one of the bigger discounts, <em>Returnal, </em>which has dropped from $70 to <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=BF-Returnal&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FReturnal-PlayStation-5%2F721660344">$30</a>.</p><p>There are good deals on multi-platform titles too, such as Eidos-Montreal&#39;s surprisingly wonderful <a href="https://www.engadget.com/guardians-galaxy-game-preview-marvel-square-enix-130003598.html"><em>Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a>, which is half off at <a href="https://amzn.to/3HEBf6H">$30</a> on all platforms. <a href="https://amzn.to/3FzkPub"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/DVO7by"><em>Resident Evil: Village</em></a> are both less than half price at the minute at $20. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hades/"><em>Hades</em></a>, which is widely regarded as one of the best games of 2020, is also <a href="https://amzn.to/3CyVdvV">$20</a> on all platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Far%20Cry%206/"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a> is a third off at <a href="https://amzn.to/3nwlQ04">$40</a>, and you can save on <em>FIFA 22</em> as well. The latest edition of EA&#39;s famed soccer series is $40 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3r7Iher">PS5</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z2JBn0">Xbox Series X/S</a> (it&#39;s a digital code for the latter consoles), and $28 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3FxavTK">PS4</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/32hu9EV">Xbox One</a>.</p><p>The PS5 digital edition and Xbox Series S don&#39;t have disc drives, so deals on physical games won&#39;t mean much to owners of those consoles. However, it&#39;s worth checking out the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores for Black Friday deals there too.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The design is slightly sleeker and more comfortable, and you&#39;ll get about 30 hours on a single charge so you can wear them for long stretches of time. Sound quality is great with punchy bass, and Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio provides an immersive experience similar to that of Dolby Atmos. Active noise cancellation is also solid and, with Adaptive Sound Control enabled, the headphones will automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate the addition of two new features: multi-device connectivity and Speak to Chat. The former allows you to connect the XM4 to a couple of devices at once, switching between them at will. The latter will automatically pause audio coming from the headphones when it detects you speaking. Most people will likely use the former feature more on a regular basis, but the latter is nice to have, too.</p><p>For those who prefer earbuds, you&#39;ll get many similar features in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4</a>. These earned a score of 86 from us for their excellent sound quality and ANC, improved battery life and wireless charging case. They also have the same Speak-to-Chat feature that the headphones have, even if it can be a bit finicky sometimes. The ANC on these buds is noticeably better than that of their predecessors, and they also support 360 Reality Audio.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Their high price tags can make it hard to be an early adopter without emptying your bank account. But Black Friday sales have come in clutch for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy Z Fold 3 — both are on sale for record-low prices at Amazon right now. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Z Flip 3" href="https://amzn.to/3Fu1kDs">Z Flip 3</a> is $150 off and down to $850 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Z Fold 3" href="https://amzn.to/3x3pilQ">Z Fold 3</a> is $300 off and down to $1,500. Both also come with a free pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Galaxy Buds 2</a> if you apply the promotional offer on the product page before checking out. If you&#39;d rather order directly from Samsung, you can get the same deal on the Z Fold 3 there, but the Z Flip 3 costs an extra $50.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Fu1kDs" id="e6526d31ce0d4ab58354247d5cfbb0f0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Z Flip 3 at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3qSa0iN" id="971457e494b64673b512c3115cbb973a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Z Flip 3 at Samsung - $900</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3x3pilQ" id="617b440c799243289d7cefa184296ed5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Z Fold 3 at Amazon - $1,500</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3qT69ly" id="f63eebde241a40268f9b2ad50af7583e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Z Fold 3 at Samsung - $1,500</a><p>Out of the two, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Z Flip 3</a> impressed us more, in part because Samsung fixed many of the problems found in its predecessor. While you&#39;ll still notice a crease in its 6.7-inch AMOLED display, it&#39;s not as noticeable as before, and the screen and the device overall seems more durable this time around. The handset doesn&#39;t scratch as easily anymore and it&#39;s IPX8 water resistant, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The main screen runs at 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and is lovely to use, and it supports up to 120Hz refresh rates. When folded, the 1.9-inch external screen displays short bits of information like the weather and calendar events, and it can be used to quickly access certain features like Samsung Pay. We also appreciate the new software features that Samsung built in that are foldable specific such as Flex Mode, which will show things like a a YouTube video on the top half of the display when the device is partially folded and the comments section on the bottom.</p><p>While the Z Flip 3 is both impressive and fairly practical, we found the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Z Fold 3</a> to be remarkable but much less useful. It&#39;s larger and heavier for one, and when closed, it&#39;s narrower than most smartphones, which makes it a bit awkward. Its 7.6-inch AMOLED interior display provides an immersive experience and is more flexible than previous iterations, and we appreciate the S Pen support. But overall, it&#39;s not the best smartphone nor the best small tablet.
