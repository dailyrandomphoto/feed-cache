The company said it has suspended or removed another 3,465 accounts connected to eight operations in six countries.</p><p>Most of the accounts were suspended for violating platform manipulation and spam policies. All content linked to the campaigns has been scrubbed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By far the biggest network of accounts Twitter <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/disclosing-state-linked-information-operations-we-ve-removed">removed this time around</a> was one that “amplified Chinese Communist Party narratives related to the treatment of the Uyghur population in Xinjiang.” It detected and took action against 2,048 such accounts. The company also took down 112 accounts linked to Changyu Culture, a company that&#39;s backed by the regional government of Xinjiang.&nbsp;</p><p>A network of 418 accounts found to be participating in “coordinated inauthentic activity” that supported the president of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Movement party is gone. So too is a group of 276 “inauthentic” accounts that mainly shared content supporting Mexican government actions linked to political parties and public health.</p><p>Elsewhere, Twitter removed 277 accounts that promoted the views of the Venezuelan government. It suspended an app called Twitter Patria, which it says people connected to the removed accounts were using.</p><p>Gone too are 268 accounts that were filing bad-faith reports against civil rights group FichuaTanzania, its founder and members and supporters. Some of those were tweeting pro-government messages as well. Lastly, Twitter says it removed two batches of accounts connected to Russia — 16 that promoted a pro-Russia perspective in the Central African Republic, and 50 that criticized the civic Libyan government and promoted Russia’s geopolitical position there and in Syria.</p><p>Since it started disclosing its efforts against state-linked manipulation campaigns three years ago, Twitter says it has removed more than 200 million tweets and nine terabytes of media connected to them. The company has taken action against operations originating in 17 countries.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-state-propaganda-campaigns-china-russia-venezuela-tanzania-uganda-mexico-164654523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">687a9084-cdce-474b-8ce9-30cc8e457b19</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 16:46:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638548294</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T16:18:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/55e8e790-f165-11eb-b7df-95947e431a3a" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/55e8e790-f165-11eb-b7df-95947e431a3a" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Kelly / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A logo is seen on the New York Twitter offices after they announced they will close their re-opened offices effective immediately in response to updated CDC guidelines during the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., July 29, 2021.

The <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL), says that Europe’s data protection regulators will soon declare the current regime illegal. At the heart of this complaint is both how the industry asks for permission, and then how it serves adverts to users online. Describing the situation as the “world’s biggest data breach,” the consequences of the ruling could have staggering ramifications for everything that we do online.</p><h3>“The world’s biggest data breach”</h3><p>Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is the mechanism by which most online ads are served to you today, and lies at the heart of the issue. Visit a website and, these days, you will notice a split-second delay between the content loading, and the adverts that surround it. You may be reading a line in an article, only for the text to suddenly leap halfway down the page, as a new advert takes its place in front of your eyes. This delay, however small, accommodates a labyrinthine process in which countless companies bid to put their advert in front of your eyes. Omri Kedem, from digital marketing agency <a href="https://croud.com/en-gb/">Croud</a>, explained that the whole process takes less than 100 milliseconds from start to finish.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Targeted advertising is the lifeblood of the internet, providing social media platforms and news organisations with a way to make money. Advertisers feel more confident paying for ads if they can be reasonably certain that the person on the other end is inside the target market. But, in order to make sure that this works, the platform hosting the ad needs to know everything it can about you, the user.</p><p>This is how, say, a sneaker store is able to market its wares to the local sneakerheads or a vegan restaurant looks for vegans and vegetarians in its local area. Companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-removes-sensitive-topic-ad-targeting-222436773.html">Facebook</a> have made huge profits on their ability to laser-focus ad campaigns on behalf of advertisers. But this process has a dark side, and this micro-targeting can, for instance, be used to enable hateful conduct. The most notable example is from 2017, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"><em>ProPublica</em></a> found that you could target a cohort of users deemed anti-semitic with the tag “Jew Hater.”</p><p>Every time you visit a website, a number of facts about you are broadcast to the site’s owner including your IP address. But that data can also include your exact longitude and latitude (if you have built-in GPS), your carrier and device type. Visit a news website every day and it’s likely that both the publisher and ad-tech intermediary will track which sections you spend more time reading.</p><div id="bee70a6895a14c2481680214770623bd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can download Mobilewalla and Ubermedia&#39;s data directories from the evidence we sent the DPC 13+ months ago here <a href="https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC">https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC</a>.

Subscribe to a publication like the <em>Financial Times</em> or <em>Forbes</em>, for instance, and you’ll be asked about your job title and industry. From there, publishers can make clear assumptions about your annual income, social class and political interests. Combine this information — known in the industry as <a href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/deterministic-probabilistic-data#:~:text=Deterministic%20data%2C%20also%20referred%20to,one%20user%20to%20one%20dataset.&amp;text=Probabilistic%20data%20is%20information%20that,likelihood%20of%20a%20certain%20outcome.">deterministic data</a> — with the inferences made based on your browsing history — known as probabilistic data — and you can build a fairly extensive profile of a user.</p><p>“The more bidders you have on something you’re trying to sell, in theory, the better,” says Dr. Johnny Ryan. Ryan is a Senior Fellow at the ICCL with a specialism in Information Rights and has been leading the charge against Real-Time Bidding for years. In order to make targeted advertising work, the publisher and ad intermediary will compress your life into a series of codes: Bidstream Data. Ryan says that this is a list of “identification codes [which] are highly unique to you,” and is passed on to a number of auction sites.</p><p>“The most obvious identification is the app that you’re using, which can be very compromising indeed, or the specific URL that you’re visiting,” says Ryan. He added that the URL of the site, which can be included in this information, can be “excruciatingly embarrassing” if seen by a third party. If you’re looking up information about a health condition or material related to your sexuality and sexual preferences, this can also be added to the data. And there’s no easy and clean way to edit or redact this data as it is broadcast to countless ad exchanges.</p><p>In order to harmonize this data, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the online ad industry’s trade body, produces a standard taxonomy. (The IAB, as it is known, has a standalone body operating in Europe, while the taxonomy itself is produced by a New York-based Tech Lab.) The <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/content-taxonomy/">IAB Content Taxonomy</a>, now in its third version, will codify you, for instance, as being into Arts and Crafts (Code 248) or Birdwatching (259). Alternatively, it can tag you as Muslim (461), Jewish (462), have an interest in sexual health (307), substance abuse (311) or if you have a child with special educational needs (199).</p><p>But not every bidder in those auctions is looking to place an ad, and some are much more interested in the data that is being shared. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypke/the-nsa-and-cia-use-ad-blockers-because-online-advertising-is-so-dangerous"><em>Motherboard</em></a> story from earlier this year revealed that the United States Intelligence Community mandates the use of ad-blockers to prevent RTB agencies from identifying serving personnel, data which could wind up in the hands of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88aw73/congress-foreign-intelligence-agencies-bidstream-real-time-bidding">rival nations</a>. Earlier versions of the Taxonomy even included tags identifying a user as potentially working for the US military.</p><p>It’s this specificity in the data, coupled with the fact that it can be shared widely and so regularly, that has prompted Ryan to call this the “world’s biggest data breach.” He cited an example of a French firm, Vectuary, which was <a href="https://brave.com/cnil-consent-rtb/">investigated</a> in 2018 by France’s data protection regulator, CNIL. What officials found was data listings for almost 68 million people, much of which had been gathered using captured RTB data. At the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported that the Vectaury case could have ramifications for the advertising market and its use of consent banners.</p><h3>The issue of consent</h3><p>In 2002, the European Union produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002">ePrivacy Directive</a>, a charter for how companies needed to get consent for the use of cookies for advertising purposes. The rules, and how they are defined, have subsequently evolved, most recently with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulations</a> (GDPR). One of the consequences of this drive is that users within the EU are presented with a pop-up banner asking them to consent to tracking. As most <a href="https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/cookies/">cookie</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies">policies</a> will explain, this tracking is used for both internal analytics and to enable targeted advertising.</p><p>To standardize and harmonize this process, IAB Europe created the<a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#who-should-create-a-tc-string"> Transparency and Consent Framework</a> (TCF). This, essentially, lets publishers copy the framework laid down by the body on the assumption that they have established a legal basis to process that data. When someone does not give consent to be tracked, a record of that decision is logged in a piece of information known as a TC String. And it’s here that the ICCL has (seemingly) claimed a victory after lodging a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, the APD, saying that this record constitutes personal data.</p><p>A draft of the ruling was shared with IAB Europe and the ICCL, and reportedly said that the APD found that a TC String did constitute personal data. On November 5th, IAB Europe published a <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/all-news/update-on-the-belgian-data-protection-authoritys-investigation-of-iab-europe/">statement</a> saying that the regulator is likely to “identify infringements of the GDPR by IAB Europe,” but added that those “infringements should be capable of being remedied within six months following the issuing of the final ruling.” Essentially, because IAB Europe was not treating these strings with the same level of care as personal data, it needs to start doing so now and / or face potential penalties.</p><p>At the same time, Dr. Ryan at the ICCL declared that <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/online-consent-pop-ups-used-by-google-and-other-tech-firms-declared-illegal/">the campaign had “won” </a>and that IAB Europe’s whole “consent system” will be “found to be illegal.” He added that IAB Europe created a fake consent system that spammed everyone, every day, and served no purpose other than to give a thin legal cover to the massive data breach in at the heart of online advertising.” Ryan ended his statement by saying that he hopes that the final decision, when it is released, “will finally force the online advertising industry to reform.”</p><p>This reform will potentially hinge on the thorny question of if a user can reasonably be relied upon to consent to tracking. Is it enough for a user to click “I Accept” and therefore write the ad-tech intermediary involved a blank check? It’s a question that ad-tech expert and lawyer Sacha Wilson, a partner at <a href="https://www.harbottle.com/">Harbottle and Lewis</a>, is interested in. He explained that, in the law, “consent has to be separate, specific, informed [and] unambiguous,” which “given the complexity of ad tech, is very difficult to achieve in a real-time environment.”</p><p>Wilson also pointed out that something that is often overstated is the quality of the data being collected by these brokers. “Data quality is a massive issue,” he said, “a significant proportion of the profile data that exists is actually inaccurate — and that has compliance issues in and of itself, the inaccuracy of the data.” (This is a reference to Article 5 of the GDPR, where people who process data should ensure that the data is accurate.) In 2018, an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation.html">Engadget analysis of data held by prominent data company Acxiom</a> showed that the information held on an individual can be often wildly inaccurate or contradictory.</p><p>One key plank of European privacy law is that it has to be easy enough to withdraw consent if you so choose. But it doesn’t appear as if this is as easy as it could be if you have to approach every vendor individually. Visit<em> ESPN</em>, for instance, and you’ll be presented with a list of vendors (listed by the OneTrust platform) that numbers into the several hundreds. <em>MailOnline’s</em> vendor list, meanwhile, runs to 1,476 entries. (Engadget’s, for what it’s worth, <a href="https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html#adtech">includes 323</a> “Advertising Technologies” partners.) It is not necessarily the case that all of those vendors will be engaged at all times, but it does suggest that users cannot simply withdraw consent at every individual broker without a lot of time and effort.</p><h3>Transparency and consent</h3><p>Townsend Feehan is the CEO of <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/">IAB Europe</a>, the body currently awaiting a decision from the APD concerning its data protection practices. She says that the thing that the industry’s critics are missing is that “none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no.” She added that “at the point where they open the page, users have control. [They can] either withhold consent, or they can use the right to object, if the asserted legal basis is legitimate interest, then none of the processing can happen.” She added that users do, or do not, consent to the discrete use of their data to a list of “disclosed data controllers,” saying that “those data controllers have no entitlement to share your data with anyone else,” since doing so would be illegal.</p><p>[Legitimate Interest is a framework within the GDPR enabling companies to collect data without consent. This can include where doing so is in the legitimate interests of an organization or third party, the processing does not cause undue harm or detriment to the person involved.]</p><p>While the type of sharing described by the ICCL and Dr. Ryan isn’t impossible, from a technical standpoint, Feehan made it clear that to do so is illegal under European law. “If that happens, it is a breach of the law,” she said, “and that law needs to be enforced.” Feehan added that at the point when data is first collected, all of the data controllers who may have access to that information are named.</p><p>Feehan also said that IAB Europe had practices and procedures put in place to deal with members found to be in breach of its obligations. That can include suspension of up to 14 days if a violation is found, with further suspensions liable if breaches aren’t fixed. IAB Europe can also permanently remove a company that has failed to address its policies, which it signs up to when it joins the TCF. She added that the body is currently working to further automate its audit processes in order to ensure it can proactively monitor for breaches and that users who are concerned about a potential breach can contact the body to share their suspicions.</p><p>It is hard to speculate on what the ruling would mean for IAB Europe and the current ad-tech regime more broadly. Feehan said that only when the final ruling was released would we know what changes the ad industry will have to institute. She asserted that IAB Europe was little more than a standards-setter rather than a data controller in real terms. “We don’t have access to any personal data, we don’t process any data, we’re just a trade association.” However, should the body be found to be in breach of the GDPR, it will need to offer up a clear action plan in order to resolve the issue.</p><h3>It’s not just consent fatigue</h3><p>The issue of Real-Time Bidding data being collected is not simply an issue of companies being greedy or lax with our information. The RTB process means that there is always a risk that data will be passed to companies with less regard for their legal obligations. And if a data broker is able to make some cash from your personal information, it may do so without much care for your individual rights, or privacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mobilewalla-says-data-it-gathered-from-consumers-cellphones-ended-up-with-government-11637242202"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> recently reported that Mobilewalla, an Atlanta-based ad-tech company, had enabled warrantless surveillance through the sale of its RTB data. Mobilewalla’s vast trove of information, some of which was collected from RTB, was sold to a company called Gravy Analytics. Gravy, in turn, passed the information to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Vental, which then sold the information to a number of federal agencies and related partners.</p><div id="b3eb13b4a7a74e9d80d46ba73b2e085c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In its &#39;data dictionary&#39; doc from Dec 2020, Mobilewalla still states that it harvests and sells precise GPS location data including device IDs on people in GDPR countries like Germany, Spain, Finland, France, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden.<br><br>Online here:<a href="https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm">https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm</a><a href="https://t.co/pD5xPJlUdL">pic.twitter.com/pD5xPJlUdL</a></p>— Wolfie Christl (@WolfieChristl) <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1461371902744797195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This trove of information may not have had real names attached, but the <em>Journal </em>says that it’s easy enough to tie an address to where a person’s phone is placed most evenings. And this information was, at the very least, passed on to and used by the Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and US Military. All three reportedly tracked individuals both in the US and abroad without a warrant enabling them to do so.</p><p>In July 2020, Mobilewalla came under fire after reportedly revealing that it had tagged and tracked the identity of Black Lives Matter protesters. At the time, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-urge-ftc-probe-of-mobile-ad-industrys-tracking-of-consumers-11596214541?mod=article_inline"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> report added that the company’s CEO, in 2017, boasted that the company could track users while they visit their places of worship to enable advertisers to sell directly to religious groups.</p><p>This sort of snooping and micro-targeting is not, however, limited to the US, with the ICCL finding a report made by data broker OnAudience.com. The study, a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4.-Evidence-of-election-interference-in-Poland-Appendix-A.pdf">copy of which it hosts on its website</a>, discusses the use of databases to create a cohort of around 1.4 million users. These people were targeted based on a belief that they were “interested in LGBTQ+,” identified because they had searched for relevant topics in the prior 14 days. Given both the unpleasant historical precedent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany">listing people</a> by their sexuality and the ongoing assault on LGBT rights in the country, the ease at which this took place may concern some.</p><h3>Looking to the future</h3><p>On November 25th, the APD <a href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/burger/gba-stuurt-ontwerpbesluit-in-zaak-iab-europe-naar-europese-tegenhangers">announced</a> that it had sent its draft decision to its counterparts in other parts of Europe. If the procedure doesn’t hit any roadblocks, then the ruling will be made public around four weeks later, which means at some point in late December. Given the holidays, we may not see the likely fallout — if any — until January. But it’s possible that either this doesn’t make much of a change in the ad landscape, or it could be dramatic. What’s likely, however, is that the issues around how much a user can consent to having their data used in this manner won’t go away overnight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/europe-tracking-consent-iccl-iab-eu-gdpr-153055765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10eeb3fa-e3c4-4b90-a98b-757754ddb58b</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 15:30:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638543975</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T15:06:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/26e38a30-6264-11eb-a1bf-49d42f404ea4" width="6016" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/26e38a30-6264-11eb-a1bf-49d42f404ea4" width="6016" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[#Urban-Photographer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Accept cookies with a tablet to illustrate cookie banners for websites with cookies in German Cookie-Banner rechtskonform? in English Cookies accepted yes no privacy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cookies with a tablet to clarify cookie banners for websites with in German cookies accept yes no data protection in English Cookies acceepted yes no Privacy]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple got Prince William to record a 'Time to Walk' Fitness+ episode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/"><ins>Apple</ins></a> has brought in several high-profile figures for guest appearances on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20fitness/"><ins>Fitness+</ins></a> series &quot;Time to Walk.&quot; Among them are Dolly Parton, Randall Park, Camilla Cabello and Stephen Fry.

Also, the option is off by default, so you&#39;ll have to find it in settings if you want to take advantage of your phone&#39;s capabilities.</p><p>As the publication notes, <em>Pokémon Go</em> was previously capped at 30fps on iOS — players have had to employ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9rdvq0/solution_how_to_run_game_60_fps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">workarounds</a> to get their games to run at 60fps — but newer phones are capable of more frames per second than that. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-promotion-display-third-party-apps-225100034.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, for instance, has a 120fps screen. <em>The Verge</em> says switching the feature on made a huge difference and made the game a lot more responsive. While Niantic may have been trying to cater to owners of the new iPhone, the option can also be accessed on its predecessors. It just may not work as well on hardware powered by older chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can find the the feature in the game&#39;s advanced settings, which will show &quot;native refresh rate unlocked&quot; when it&#39;s switched on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-ios-higher-refresh-rates-123636483.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">212989ca-7135-413e-98bc-04a047d3276f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:36:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638533783</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T12:16:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[adamkaz via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[La Habra, United States - July 12, 2016: Macro closeup image of pokemon go game app icon among other icons on an iphone smartphone device.

According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, company security VP Chris Rackow told employees in an email that Google will wait to reassess the situation and figure out when it&#39;s safe to return to an in-office environment until the new year. The tech giant originally planned to implement a hybrid work week starting on October 18th before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-voluntary-return-to-office-plan-204850097.html">pushing it back</a> to January next year. Now, it may all depend on each of its offices.&nbsp;</p><p>Rackow didn&#39;t explain the company&#39;s reasoning in his email, and he didn&#39;t mention the newly discovered Omicron COVID-19 variant, as well. There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and experts are still looking into whether it&#39;s more transmissible than previous variants and if it&#39;s more resistant to current vaccines. What he reportedly said, however, is that Google will allow specific offices to decide when it&#39;s safe to go back into the office. The company will form Local Incident Response Teams to help them assess risk levels, but bottom line is that Google employees may not be required to adhere to a hybrid workplace schedule all at the same time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite canceling its January 10th target date, Google is still encouraging employees to work in the office &quot;where conditions allow, to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in [one] more regularly.&quot; Google has already reopened 90 percent of its offices in the US, and 40 percent of its employees in the country already came in. As for its international locations, the company also delayed workers&#39; return to face-to-face work in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-delays-workers-return-to-office-055953394.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8544eeb2-e9f9-46f0-96b3-83bf0705d401</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 05:59:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638511233</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T06:00:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/02e7b590-53f7-11ec-ac5a-5fc332937592" width="7570" height="5047" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/02e7b590-53f7-11ec-ac5a-5fc332937592" width="7570" height="5047" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Page Light Studios via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chicago, IL - September 7. 2019: View of the new Google building in the West Loop, Fulton Market area of downtown Chicago.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google building in the West Loop, Fulton Market area]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scientists describe a tiny, molten metal exoplanet in unprecedented detail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists are getting better at characterizing exoplanets, and that&#39;s leading to some surprising discoveries.

It&#39;s so close to its host red dwarf star that an orbit takes just 7.7 hours, and the radiation is so intense that it could reach up to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit. That&#39;s enough to melt any metals and rocks, and certainly wouldn&#39;t allow for life as we know it. It&#39;s safe to presume there won&#39;t be any colonization missions as a result.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The assessment by itself is notable, however. GJ 367b is the smallest planet ever characterized to this level of detail, and that could help in the search for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-27-search-habitable-planets-second-earth-exoplanets.html">more habitable exoplanets</a>, understanding planet formation and even gauging the criteria for habitability.

The funding is part of NASA’s <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/2f2eacc157274cd6a3d134f25b1c4505/view">Commercial LEO Development program</a>, which aims to &quot;develop a robust commercial space economy in LEO, including supporting the development of commercially owned and operated LEO destinations.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2a7852b0-53b4-11ec-bea2-b743b8056a5c" alt="Orbital Reef" data-uuid="c94f6a3f-0e2b-30d8-8154-cbb53d4f23c7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blue Origin</div></figure><p>“We are pleased that NASA supports the development of Orbital Reef, a revolutionary approach to making Earth orbit more accessible to diverse customers and industries,” Brent Sherwood, Senior Vice President of Advanced Development Programs for Blue Origin, said in a prepared statement. The station would be an orbital &quot;mixed-use space business park&quot; that would offer any number of turnkey services as well as reduced operational costs for burgeoning low-g industries &quot;in addition to meeting the ISS partners’ needs.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Blue Origin is partnering with Sierra Space in this project with the former focusing on the architecture and infrastructure of the station — everything from its design and construction to managing lift logistics using the New Glenn heavy launch system —  while the latter is tasked with developing the station&#39;s LIFE (Large Integrated Flexible Environment). Boeing is also helping out, designing the operations-maintenance-science module and leveraging its Starliner crew capsule. Genesis Engineering Solutions is involved as well. It&#39;s working on a single person spacecraft that tourists and employees alike will be able to putter around in.&nbsp;</p><p>Thursday&#39;s announcement, ironically, comes at the end of a year in which Blue Origin protested NASA&#39;s “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-225547469.html">fundamentally unfair</a>” decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">award a lunar lander contract to rival SpaceX</a> to the GAO, which quickly dismissed the claims. Blue Origin then sued NASA — literally, <em>sued NASA</em> —&quot;in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA&#39;s Human Landing System,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin told Engadget in August. The company subsequently lost that suit as well but, hopefully, Thursday&#39;s deal will serve as a balm for Bezos&#39; critically wounded ego.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/59e27460-53b2-11ec-affc-4c4eaa6e407f" alt="Northrop Grumman&#39;s Cygnus space station design is a series of tubes." data-uuid="5a37ef3d-8ec3-325a-8326-1d8807db1e1d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Northrop Grumman</div></figure><p>The Orbital Reef team hopes to have its first modules in orbit by the end of the decade with further expansions happening throughout the 2030s.

The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger">has sued</a> to block the merger over concerns the $40 billion deal would &quot;stifle&quot; competition for multiple technologies, including datacenters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mercedez-benz-autonomous-vehicle-computer-173014585.html">car computers</a>. ARM is a &quot;critical input&quot; that fosters competition between NVIDIA and rivals, the FTC said, and a merger would give NVIDIA a way to &quot;undermine&quot; those challengers.</p><p>The FTC was also worried NVIDIA would have access to sensitive info from ARM licensees. The merger could reduce the incentive for ARM to develop tech that might run counter to NVIDIA&#39;s business goals, officials added. The administrative trial is due to start August 9th, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn&#39;t appear bothered. NVIDIA characterized the lawsuit as the &quot;next step&quot; in the FTC process, and repeated its arguments in favor of the buyout. The acquisition would &quot;accelerate&quot; ARM&#39;s product plans, foster more competition and still protect the chip architecture designer&#39;s open licensing model, according to NVIDIA. You can read the full statement below.</p><p>Despite the claims, an FTC lawsuit is a huge issue for NVIDIA. The Commission files lawsuits like these when it believes a company is breaking the law — concessions might not be enough. It also comes after the European Commission launched an investigation into the purchase in October. NVIDIA is facing questions from major regulators clearly wary of the acquisition, and those agencies might not accept the answers.</p><p>As it stands, NVIDIA&#39;s competition likely isn&#39;t happy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">Qualcomm reportedly objected</a> to the ARM deal in communications with the FTC (among other bodies) over fears NVIDIA might refuse to license designs. And when heavyweights like Apple, MediaTek and Samsung also depend on ARM, it&#39;s doubtful the rest of the market would be enthusiastic. At the least, the trial would likely delay closure of the union past NVIDIA&#39;s original 2022 target.</p><blockquote><p>As we move into this next step in the FTC process, we will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition. NVIDIA will invest in Arm’s R&amp;D, accelerate its roadmaps, and expand its offerings in ways that boost competition, create more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem. NVIDIA is committed to preserving Arm’s open licensing model and ensuring that its IP is available to all interested licensees, current and future.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-lawsuit-nvidia-arm-212113933.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9d876f9-e037-48f2-9178-517c379fdba2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 21:21:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638480075</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T21:21:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/84b927b0-a129-11eb-b71a-4b83711de0d7" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/84b927b0-a129-11eb-b71a-4b83711de0d7" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2021/04/08: In this photo illustration a Nvidia logo seen displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages in the background.

The Wear OS device would be an eye-catching device with a round display, but no physical bezel — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a> might seem antiquated by comparison.</p><p>Rohan would be a relatively typical smartwatch on the inside with a heart rate sensor and a battery that would still require daily charging. It would use proprietary watch bands, so you&#39;d have to forget about using conventional straps. A tipster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan">talking</a> to <em>The Verge</em> claimed the watch would &quot;cost more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">a Fitbit</a>&quot; and serve as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch</a> competitor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The software may be the most important feature. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel phones</a>, Rohan would serve as a &quot;showcase&quot; for Google&#39;s platform — in this case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html">Wear OS 3</a>. The smartwatch (not necessarily called &quot;Pixel Watch,&quot; despite the name floating around) would theoretically show customers what Wear OS can do, and give hardware partners a reference point to work from. It might also include a Fitbit tie-in, nicknamed &quot;Nightlight.&quot;</p><p>Google has already declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation. However, the concept might not be new. Google supposedly axed its first attempt at an official watch in 2016 and instead has put its trust in third-party offerings from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-04-lg-g-watch-r-review.html">LG</a> and others. It&#39;s moving forward now that it has not only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-now-owns-fitbit-141747501.html">finished acquiring Fitbit</a>, but has reportedly merged its wearable team with Fitbit&#39;s and otherwise tried to replicate Apple&#39;s focus on health.</p><p>A first-party watch might be necessary. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/smartwatch-shipments-surge-q2-2021-171751707.html">dominate the smartwatch market</a> despite a flurry of low-cost hardware and competition from major brands like Samsung and Garmin. Some of this has been blamed on lackluster Wear OS hardware, not to mention a lack of significant OS updates. An official Google watch won&#39;t necessarily up-end the marketplace, but it could spur other watchmakers to try harder and add some (arguably needed) excitement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-smartwatch-release-date-211045180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1154c3aa-063e-45a5-866c-a324b604b7fd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 21:10:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638479447</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T21:11:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SoundCloud's Playback compiles your favorite jams from 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that everyone you know on social media has shared their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify Wrapped</ins></a> year-in-review, SoundCloud would like you to know it too has a chronicle of what you listened to over the last 11 months.

The top 100 account for around 82 percent of total emoji shares, even though there are more than 3,600 to choose from, not to mention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html">the mashups on Gboard</a>.</p><p>Smiling faces and hand-based emoji are generally very popular, as are the plant-flower and emotion (i.e. hearts) categories. The least popular emoji category is flags. Country flags are used the least, even though there are more emoji in that category than any other and the Summer Olympic Games, one of the biggest demonstrations of national pride, took place this year.</p><p>Given that we&#39;ve been enduring a pandemic for almost two years, it&#39;s not too surprising that there&#39;s been a rise in the use of health-related emoji. Even so, only 🥵 (Hot Face) and 🥴 (Woozy Face) made it into the top 100 this year — 🦠 (Microbe) squeaked into the top 500. After all, instead of using a specific emoji depicting sickness, many people are likely to just say they&#39;re feeling like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-signal-founder-poop-emoji-151740121.html">💩</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s heartening to know that despite the turmoil the humanity has endured lately, our emoji use trends toward happiness, love and positivity. It&#39;s far better to be a 😎 than a 🤡.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/emoji-most-used-2021-tears-of-joy-heart-positivity-170152525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">194f6dde-909c-4e27-bbfc-abb29bd76acc</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:01:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638504000</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T04:00:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1696e00-5390-11ec-b8f7-3606440b9839" width="4306" height="2932" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1696e00-5390-11ec-b8f7-3606440b9839" width="4306" height="2932" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peter Kovalev via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ST PETERSBURG, RUSSIA - MAY 26, 2019: People carry a giant Emoji balloon during a parade in Nevsky Avenue as part of the festivities marking the 316th birthday of the city of St Petersburg.
