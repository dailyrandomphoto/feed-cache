Hertz has ordered 100,000 Tesla EVs for its fleet, with plans to rent them out in major US markets and parts of Europe starting in November, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-said-to-order-100-000-teslas-in-car-rental-market-shake-up"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. That would mark the largest electric vehicle order of all time and a major move by Hertz into electric car rentals.</p><p>The order is reportedly worth $4.2 billion for the fleet (which appears to be Model 3s) according to the report. It represents about a 1/10th of what Tesla can currently produce annually, possibly allowing Hertz to lock out other rental companies. It reportedly purchased well-appointed, rather than base model versions, and paid nearly the full list price for each unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hertz customers will have access to Tesla&#39;s supercharger network, and Hertz is supposedly also building its own charging infrastructure. Eventually, Hertz (which also owns the Dollar, Thrifty and Firefly brands) plans to go nearly fully electric with its half-million vehicle fleet.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s a pretty sharp turnaround for Hertz, considering that it went bankrupt in 2020 and only emerged in June of this year. It was purchased out of bankruptcy by distressed-debt firm Knighthead Capital Management (among other firms) for $6 billion. Following a big turnaround in the market, however, it&#39;s currently valued at $11.6 billion ahead of relisting on Nasdaq, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s just half the good news for Tesla, though. The company&#39;s Model 3 was the best-selling car in Europe in September with around 24,600 registered units, marking the first time that an EV has topped the monthly standings, according to automotive analyst <a href="https://www.jato.com/ev-revolution-hits-new-milestone-as-tesla-model-3-becomes-europes-best-selling-car-in-september/"><em>JATO</em></a>. It&#39;s also the first time a vehicle manufactured outside the EU has led in sales. Tesla&#39;s sales were up by 58 percent over last year, and EV/PHEV sales in general rose 23 percent from 2020.</p><blockquote><p>Last month, registrations accounted for 74 percent of [Tesla&#39;s] third quarter volume. Since its’ entry to the European market, the Model Y has also performed well, securing second position in the BEV ranking.</p></blockquote><p>The news is big for Tesla and the EV industry in general, showing that EV sales in Europe are continuing to grow. Much of that has been driven by generous tax rebates and trade-in incentives on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. September was a particularly good month for Tesla, accounting for 74 percent of its third quarter volume, according to <em>JATO</em></p><p>Still, the automotive sector as a whole has plummeted in Europe and elsewhere because of a global chip shortage. Renault recently said that it would produce at least 300,000 fewer vehicles this year due to the global semiconductor shortage, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/renault-sees-bigger-production-hit-chip-shortage-sources-2021-10-20/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. &quot;This year, the industry has responded well to the the pandemic, but it is now facing new supply chain challenges,&quot; said <em>JATO</em> analyst Felipe Munoz. &quot;The growing popularity of EVs is encouraging, but sales are not yet strong enough to offset the big declines seen across other segments.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73d9433a-4b3f-4c8f-b474-b59d902d67c6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 13:26:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635168700</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T13:31:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c1934230-3597-11ec-bcff-9e8eda3c9b51" width="1254" height="772" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c1934230-3597-11ec-bcff-9e8eda3c9b51" width="1254" height="772" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A blue Tesla Model 3 seen driving on a highway with a water-soaked surface blurred with speed.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch review (2021): Apple’s mighty Macs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="57bf0f2591f7413d9acdab4026f6e235"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EKnqswxjKyg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Apple is finally restoring balance to its portable lineup with the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-inch" href="https://amzn.to/3EbyvLp">14-inch</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MacBook Pros" href="https://amzn.to/3Bhi5Pz">16-inch MacBook Pros</a>. If you wanted a big-screen Mac notebook for video editing over the past year, you were stuck paying a premium for outdated Intel and AMD hardware. So, we&#39;ve been eagerly awaiting an M1 upgrade for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>, a machine I called Apple&#39;s best laptop ever when it debuted two years ago.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="702b16b9-263c-4e02-8007-bd2c70e1c785"/><p>But it&#39;s worth remembering that, for all the hype around Apple&#39;s M1 chip last year, it was a let down for creative professionals. It just couldn’t handle the kinds of heavy duty video editing and 3D rendering that they demanded, in part due to being capped at 16GB of RAM. That made the 13-inch MacBook Pro a bit of an odd duck, since the Air was nearly as fast.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple&#39;s redesigned MacBook Pros, powered by its new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, are exactly what media professionals have been waiting for. The processors are far faster than last year&#39;s M1, they support up to 64GB of RAM, and both laptops feature XDR display technology borrowed from the iPad Pro. But Apple also looked backwards as it stepped forward, restoring ports and adopting a design that resembles many of its older machines. Just call them PowerBooks, reborn.</p><h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">What&#39;s new</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)" data-uuid="003dda42-34f9-33cd-8550-bf987493729b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Apple isn’t currently planning to replace the 13-inch model with the MacBook Pro 14. It’s more an expansion of the highest-end model. It can do almost everything the 16-inch model can, it’s just smaller. (The only exception is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-high-power-mode-m1-max-232408937.html">&quot;High Power Mode,&quot;</a> which gives the 16-inch M1 Max version a temporary speed boost.) That&#39;s one way I&#39;ve come to terms with the high $1,999 starting price. The bigger model now starts at $2,499, $100 more than the Intel version.</p><p>Both notebooks still look like MacBook Pros, with sleek unibody aluminum cases. But lean in a bit closer and you&#39;ll notice some retro flourishes. They&#39;re slightly thicker, with more bulbous edges that hearken back to Apple&#39;s notebooks from the 2000&#39;s. They&#39;re also heavier than you&#39;d expect: the 14-inch model comes in at 3.5 pounds, while the 16-inch varies between 4.7 and 4.8 pounds, depending on the chip you choose. That&#39;s about half a pound heavier than the last 16-inch MacBook Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that heft isn’t for naught, though. In part it allowed Apple to cram in a lot more ports. Joining three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C connections are a full-sized HDMI port, a MagSafe power connection, a high-impedance headphone jack and an SD card reader (cue triumphant horns). Sure, you’ll still need adapters to connect older USB Type-A devices, but at least you can offload photos and video without extra gear. You can still charge the notebooks over USB-C — always useful in a pinch — but the MagSafe connection is less likely to cause accidental falls and you won&#39;t have to use a precious USB-C port just to stay powered up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc287e20-350a-11ec-bdff-63bdf816ed4a" alt="MacBook Pro 16-inch (2021)" data-uuid="9dcd2e84-5b68-3755-a389-1200240d3d2d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Looking at the MacBook Pro&#39;s screens makes it clear they&#39;re anything but retro, though. They feature 14.2-inch and 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR displays, respectively. Mini-LED backlighting lets them reach up to 1,600 nits of peak brightness, which is great for HDR content. The screens are a sharp 254 pixels per inch, with a 3,024 by 1,964 resolution on the 14-inch and 3,456 by 2,234 on the 16-inch. Neither are true 4K (the 16-inch comes close), but you&#39;ll still be able to work on 4K and 8K video, just at a reduced scale.</p><p>Best of all is that the MacBook Pros support ProMotion, Apple&#39;s technology that enables refresh rates up to 120Hz. With that flipped on, scrolling through web pages and documents just felt silky smooth. And after spending hours writing up this review, I definitely noticed that my eyes were less fatigued thanks to the speedy refresh rate. This is becoming more common in the laptop world. Microsoft already beat Apple to the punch by putting a 120Hz screen in the Surface Laptop Studio. ProMotion is also intelligent enough to lower the refresh rate when it makes sense, which goes a long way towards saving battery life.</p><p>Really though, you don&#39;t have to think about all of the technology going into Apple&#39;s Liquid Retina XDR displays. Just know that they look incredible, with eye-watering brightness in sunny HDR scenes and inky black darkness in night shots. These aren&#39;t OLED screens, but mini-LEDs get Apple pretty close to that level of contrast.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Embracing the notch life</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc283000-350a-11ec-9de5-9ef7c877d638" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)" data-uuid="7bcc9cb2-3b53-38f9-8fcb-67409cbcf4cb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Now let&#39;s talk about the elephant in the room: that notch in the middle of the screen. Much like the last batch of iPhones, Apple carved out a portion of the display to fit in a camera. In this case a 1080p webcam. Upon first glance, it&#39;s almost laughable that Apple is leaning even more into a design element that everyone hates. But, honestly, the notch isn&#39;t a big deal.</p><p>Apple wisely pushed the MacOS menu bar around the camera, so it&#39;s really just taking up space that would go unused anyway. The menu bar also gets blacked out entirely whenever you put an app or video in fullscreen. You could also use a black wallpaper which effectively hides the notch.</p><p>I&#39;ll happily give up a bit of screen real estate, though, if it means Apple can finally squeeze in a decent camera. And judging from the dozens of video calls I&#39;ve been on over the past week, it&#39;s a huge upgrade. There&#39;s a clear leap forward in resolution, sharpness and detail compared to my 2017 MacBook Pro. And it definitely looks better than the M1 MacBook Air, which had a few tweaks, but was still stuck at 720p. It would have been nice to see FaceID on the MacBook Pro though, which would have brought it on-par with Windows Hello-equipped PCs. For now, you&#39;ll still have to rely on the TouchID sensor on the power button.</p><h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">In use</h2><section data-eng-breakout="4cc3e8fb3de94a1a972cf1f96a8dbdb3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a962-350a-11ec-be7f-06c7491808ec" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch stacked on each other  (2021)"></section><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Our 14-inch review model was equipped with an M1 Pro sporting 16 GPU cores, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The 16-inch had the 32 GPU core M1 Max, a 2TB SSD and a whopping 64GB of RAM. (This, by the way, marks the first time I&#39;ve reviewed a laptop with that much RAM.) Both of Apple&#39;s new chips also feature 10 CPU cores — for comparison, the M1 had  eight CPU cores and eight GPU cores.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p><strong>Geekbench 5 CPU</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Cinebench R23</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Disk speed (top reads/writes)</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro (14-inch)</p></td><td><p>1,767/11,777</p></td><td><p>1,515/12,118</p></td><td><p>5.1 GB/s / 5.8 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021)</p></td><td><p>1,783/12,693</p></td><td><p>1,524/12,281</p></td><td><p>5.1 GB/s / 6.2 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Apple MacBook Pro (Apple M1, 13-inch, 2020)</p></td><td><p>1,696/7,174</p></td><td><p>1,492/7,467</p></td><td><p>3GB/s / 3GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 (Intel i7-11800H, RTX 3050 Ti)</p></td><td><p>1,536/7,551</p></td><td><p>1,506/9,453</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s / 2.6 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 14 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX.

And the benchmarks didn&#39;t disappoint: According to GeekBench 5, both MacBook Pros blew away every Windows PC we reviewed this year by a significant margin. That includes the NUC 11 Extreme powered by Intel&#39;s Core i9-11900KB, a high-end desktop CPU! The single-core performance on the M1 Pro and Max was similar to the M1, which is unsurprising. But the multi-core figures were far higher. Another nice plus: Both of these computers are equipped with very fast NVMe SSDs, which will be a huge help when working with large projects.&nbsp;</p><p>The GPU-heavy Geekbench 5 Compute score made it clear that Apple hasn&#39;t completely surpassed the likes of NVIDIA and AMD, though. The 14-inch MacBook Pro was more than twice as fast as the Surface Pro 8 (running Intel&#39;s Xe graphics) and the M1-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro, while the bigger notebook was on-par with the Surface Laptop Studio equipped with an NVIDIA 3050 Ti. These aren&#39;t bad scores, but it makes it clear that users who need serious power for 3D rendering or data crunching may be better off with PCs equipped with dedicated GPUs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a963-350a-11ec-b7ef-a88eac9fcaf2" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)" data-uuid="555400d7-d2b4-31f3-9aff-a113cc14a78b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I don&#39;t think those are the people Apple is trying to court, though. Instead, the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pros seem like an attempt to get back in the good graces of audio and video producers. Apple&#39;s new chips will certainly be more than enough for dealing with media. Both computers managed to convert a 4K video clip to 1080p in 34 seconds with Apple&#39;s VideoToolbox hardware encoder, which is four seconds slower than the NUC 11 Extreme, but four seconds faster than the XPS 15. They were also among the fastest Cinebench R23 performers we saw this year — only the ASUS ROG Strix G15 gaming laptop bested them.</p><p>And before you ask, no, the M1 Pro and M1 Max don&#39;t magically turn these computers into gaming rigs. Sure, everything on Apple Arcade runs smoothly, but that was true of the MacBook Air. When I tried to load <em>Borderlands 3</em>, one of the few semi-recent games that actually works on Macs, I just got an unplayable mess running below 30fps. Maybe the the guarantee of decent GPUs will encourage more game developers to build for Macs, but more likely they&#39;ll just end up making sure their iPhone and iPad games run smoothly.</p><p>Surprisingly, I didn’t notice a huge difference in performance when I was running the MacBook Pros on battery. PCs often slow down dramatically whenever they’re disconnected from a socket, but not so with these notebooks. That’s useful if you need to encode something remotely and you’re willing to sacrifice battery life to get it done.</p><p>Don’t worry though, the efficiency of the M1 chip’s ARM design leads to great battery performance. The 14-inch MacBook Pro lasted 12 hours and 35 minutes in our benchmark, while the 16-inch went for 16 hours and 34 minutes. That’s over five hours longer than the last Intel model.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc283003-350a-11ec-9df9-81e921cfd625" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)" data-uuid="95b47e63-cf2d-397c-963a-355b8f359537"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It’s clear that Apple listened to many of the complaints from Mac fans (and perhaps even lowly reviewers). But really, that’s something the company has been doing more over the years, like when it finally moved away from those awful butterfly keyboards to more tactile Magic Keyboards. By the way, typing on the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro remains excellent, and the trackpad is a dream to use, as always.</p><p>Apple didn&#39;t skimp on the audio front either. Both MacBook Pros sport a six-speaker array, made up of two tweeters and four force-cancelling woofers. Simply put, they sound miraculous. I normally just play a few songs on notebook speakers to confirm how disappointing they are. But these laptops sounded like I was listening to two small bookshelf speakers, with transparent vocals and punchy bass. Yes, I&#39;m as shocked as you are.</p><p>The 16-inch MacBook Pro sounds a bit better, since it has room for slightly bigger drivers, but both notebooks are enough for a private jam session. The MacBook Pro&#39;s microphones also do a solid job of capturing speech during video calls. I wouldn&#39;t use them to record professional music, as Apple suggested you could, but they’re probably fine for a quick podcast session on the road.</p><h2 dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc271e90-350a-11ec-ab7c-6d5adf8edae1" alt="MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch sitting on a table(2021)" data-uuid="5a47480d-71e4-3183-90f8-5dd1c8a309b1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">So if you’re in the market for one of these new computers, which should you get? If you’re mostly using it for general productivity tasks, then I’d lean towards the 14-inch model, which was just easier to travel with. It’s a good option for coders and people who may not need a ton of screen real estate. But all of the video and audio producers I’ve talked to were unequivocal: they wanted to go big with the 16-inch model.</p><p>The biggest downside of the new MacBook Pros are their high prices — but really, what else do you expect from Apple? The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-inch model" href="https://amzn.to/3EbyvLp">14-inch model</a>, in particular, will probably give you the vapors if you&#39;re comparing it to the 13-inch MacBook Pro. But in the world of gaming and high-end productivity notebooks, Apple&#39;s pricing isn&#39;t that far off. The Razer Blade 14, for example, is just two hundred dollars less than the MacBook Pro 14-inch. Dell&#39;s XPS 15 OLED is around $500 cheaper than the cheapest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MBP" href="https://amzn.to/3Bhi5Pz">16-inch MBP</a>, but that&#39;s with a CPU that&#39;s much slower than Apple&#39;s.

The reporting, by <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em> and others, paints a picture of a company that repeatedly sought to prioritize dominance and profit over user safety. This was, however, despite a large number of employees warning that the company’s focus on engagement put users at risk of real-world violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, for instance, claims that while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg played down reports that the site amplified hate speech in testimony to Congress, he was aware that the problem was far broader than publicly declared. Internal documents seen by the <em>Post</em> claim that the social network had removed less than five percent of hate speech, and that executives — including Zuckerberg — were well aware that Facebook was polarizing people. The claims have already been rebutted by Facebook, which says that the documents have been misrepresented.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg is also accused of squashing a plan to run a Spanish-language voter-registration drive in the US before the 2020 elections. He said that the plan may have appeared “partisan,” with WhatsApp staffers subsequently offering a watered-down version partnering with outside agencies. The CEO was also reportedly behind the decision not to clamp down on COVID-19 misinformation in the early stages of the pandemic as there may be a “material tradeoff with MSI [Meaningful Social Interaction — an internal Facebook metric] impact.” Facebook has refuted the claim, saying that the documents have been mischaracterized.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25/"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that Facebook has serially neglected a number of developing nations, allowing hate speech and extremism to flourish. That includes not hiring enough staffers who can speak the local language, appreciate the cultural context and otherwise effectively moderate. The result is that the company has unjustified faith in its automatic moderation systems which are ineffective in non-English speaking countries. Again, Facebook has refuted the accusation that it is neglecting its users in those territories.</p><p>One specific region that is singled out for concern is Myanmar, where Facebook has been held responsible for amplifying local tensions. A 2020 document suggests that the company’s automatic moderation system could not flag problematic terms in (local language) Burmese. (It should be noted that, two years previously, Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html">failure to properly act to prevent civil unrest in Myanmar</a> was highlighted in a report from Business for Social Responsibility.)</p><p>Similarly, Facebook reportedly did not have the tools in place to detect hate speech in the Ethiopian languages of Oromo or Amharic. Facebook has said that it is working to expand its content moderation team and, in the last two years, has recruited Oromo, Amharic and Burmese speakers (as well as a number of other languages).</p><p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, reports that Facebook’s internal research was well-aware that the Like and Share functions — core elements of how the platform work — had accelerated the spread of hate speech. A document, titled What Is Collateral Damage, says that Facebook’s failure to remedy these issues will see the company “actively (if not necessarily consciously) promoting these types of activities.” Facebook says that, again, these statements are based on incorrect premises, and that it would be illogical for the company to try and actively harm its users.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, meanwhile, has focused on the supposed collapse in Facebook’s engagement metrics. Young people, a key target market for advertisers, are spending less time on Facebook’s platform, with fewer teens opting to sign up. At the same time, the number of users may be artificially inflated in these age groups, with users choosing to create multiple accounts — “Finstas” — to separate their online personas to cater to different groups. Haugen alleges that Facebook “has misrepresented core metrics to investors and advertisers,” and that duplicate accounts are leading to “extensive fraud” against advertisers. Facebook says that it already notifies advertisers of the risk that purchases will reach duplicate accounts in its Help Center, and lists the issue in its SEC filings.</p><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-papers-badge-posts-former-employees/"><em><ins>Wired</ins></em></a> focuses on how Facebook’s employees regularly leave valedictions when they leave the company. And how these missives have become increasingly gloomy, with one departing employee writing that the platform has a “net negative influence on politics.” Another said that they felt that they had “blood on their hands,” while a third said that their ability to effect changes to Facebook’s systems to improve matters was hampered by internal roadblocks.</p><p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.axios.com/clegg-facebook-exec-bad-headlines-whistleblower-documents-9acbf8c8-94c1-4ce6-97f0-0cf03b1bc7c0.html"><em>Axios</em></a> reported that Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-19-facebook-hires-tarnished-uk-politician-to-fix-its-reputation.html">Sir Nick Clegg</a> warned that the site should expect “more bad headlines” in the coming weeks. Between the material available in the Facebook Papers, another round of Frances Haugen’s testimony in the UK later today and rumors of more whistleblowers coming forward, it’s likely that Facebook will remain in the headlines for some time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f04e2e24-86e1-4b99-9520-8f8110c2569b</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 12:07:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635168132</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T13:22:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8be5e60-3589-11ec-9e7d-4e9217b3ed55" width="4500" height="2995" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8be5e60-3589-11ec-9e7d-4e9217b3ed55" width="4500" height="2995" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg listens during a joint hearing of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill April 10, 2018 in Washington, DC.

Musk said one such issue is &quot;regression&quot; with left turns, while testers have posted about phantom forward collision warnings, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/">autosteer bugs</a> and more. The FSD has supposedly been reverted to version 10.2, but some users said they no longer have access to FSD at all, according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743628/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw"><em>The Verge</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="72fbcce6044d428b9806bf21749d489f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. <br><br>Please note, this is to be expected with beta software.

Those include FSD Profiles that allow drivers to change vehicle behavior for rolling stops, lane changes, following distance and more. Others include improved creeping speed, reduced false slowdowns, improved crossing object velocity estimation and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, testers have noted in several videos that FSD is showing Forward Collision Warnings despite no apparent danger, along with unexpected autobraking. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qexhq9/20213652_fsd_103_rollback_to_20213651_in_progress/">Others</a> have seen traffic aware cruise control (TACC) problems, AutoPilot &quot;panic&quot; and other bugs.</p><p>Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &quot;to be expected with beta software,&quot; adding that &quot;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&quot; The last beta release, FSD 10.2, was delayed due to &quot;last minute concerns&quot; about the update.&nbsp;</p><p>The pullback and Musk&#39;s comments about public beta testing are bound to further increase scrutiny of the FSD program. The NHTSA has already requested more data from Tesla around the public beta, saying Tesla needs to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musks-push-to-expand-teslas-driver-assistance-to-cities-rankles-a-top-safety-authority-11632043803?mod=hp_lead_pos3">address</a> &quot;basic safety issues&quot; before expanding it further. Regulators have also asked Tesla for more information about its &quot;<a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOT-PE21020-85593P.pdf">safety score</a>&quot; ratings that make certain drivers eligible for the FSD program.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulators are also concerned that while Tesla drivers can opt into the beta program, drivers and pedestrians in the vicinity cannot. For example, some Tesla vehicles with the 10.3 software auto-braked without reason, which could have caused a collision with a vehicle following behind.&nbsp;</p><p>The name itself is misleading (much like Autopilot), as FSD does not offer full self-driving at all, but simply advanced driver assistance.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27798052-c455-4d59-a723-cc248f73fe46</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 06:33:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635144904</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T06:55:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c395900-3556-11ec-b7fd-4efdb713370a" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c395900-3556-11ec-b7fd-4efdb713370a" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla pulls latest self-driving beta over left turn and other 'issues']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla pulls latest self-driving beta over left turn and other 'issues']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Resident Evil's Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine come to 'Fortnite']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic Games&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-street-fighter-crossover-204802351.html">fondness for Capcom</a> continues unabated.

Rank-and-file employees have accused Facebook of making &quot;special exceptions&quot; from policies for right-wing outlets, while senior-level staff warned of potential pitfalls.</p><p>Workers argued that Facebook kept <em>Breitbart</em> in a second tier of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-facebook-announces-facebook-news.html">News Tab</a>, a section meant to focus on reliable news, despite very low trust and quality scores as well as misinformation violations. Facebook was not only making exceptions, one employee said, but &quot;explicitly&quot; endorsing outlets like this by including them as trusted partners. Staff claimed Facebook was &quot;scared of political backlash&quot; if it enforced policies equally, and believed the site let conservative influencers Diamond and Silk lobby fact checkers to avoid punishment for spreading misinformation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Higher-ups countered with justifications for those decisions. They argued that booting a news outlet for trust scores would risk booting more mainstream outlets like <em>CNN</em>, for instance. When staff asked Facebook to intervene over <em>Breitbart</em>&#39;s alleged attempts to dodge sites&#39; advertising blocks, a director said Facebook had to resist the urge and &quot;rely on our principles and policies.&quot;</p><p>Facebook repeated its familiar stance in a response to the <em>Journal</em>, maintaining that limited access to low-quality material to &quot;improve people&#39;s experiences,&quot; not due to political leanings.  A spokesperson added that Facebook studied the effects of potential changes before implementing them, and that publishers like <em>Breitbart</em> still met requirements for honoring rules against misinformation and hate speech.</p><p>The revelations likely won&#39;t satisfy people on either side of the American political spectrum. Liberals may be concerned Facebook is knowingly allowing the spread of heavily spun and outright false claims, while the right wing may see it as evidence of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">claimed anti-conservative bias</a>. The insights reveal a more conflicted approach to material, though.

As <em>CBS News</em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hawaiian-scientists-discover-one-of-the-youngest-planets-ever-seen/">says</a>, a University of Hawaii-led team has <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2021/10/22/infant-planet-discovered-2m0437b/">discovered</a> 2M0437b, one of the youngest planets ever found at &#39;just&#39; several million years old. The baby planet was found in the Taurus Cloud &quot;nursery&quot; and young enough that it&#39;s still emanating lava-like heat from its birth.</p><p>Importantly, this is also a very rare chance at directly observing an infant world. Researchers will still need to use special optics to compensate for Earth&#39;s atmosphere, but they won&#39;t have to use the host star or other tricks to study the planet. It helps that 2M0437b is about one hundred times further from its star than Earth is from the Sun, reducing the chances for interference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scientists first spotted the planet in 2018 using the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-18-ancient-stars-evidence.html">Subaru Telescope</a>, but spent the next three years using the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-31-keck-observatory-exoplanet-imager.html">Keck Observatory</a> and other Hawaii telescopes to track the planet and confirm it was tied to its host.</p><p>Future observations could shed more light on planetary formation. It might not take much longer to glean more details, either. The team hoped the imminent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">James Webb Space Telescope</a> could help detect atmospheric gases and newly forming moons. As significant as 2M0437b might be now, it could be more important going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/astronomers-directly-observe-young-planet-180712014.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d39eab52-571e-41a2-a914-5c882565e66d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 24 Oct 2021 18:07:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635164581</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T12:23:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/067c12c0-34f1-11ec-bbaf-c089b5671f2b" width="1920" height="1082" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/067c12c0-34f1-11ec-bbaf-c089b5671f2b" width="1920" height="1082" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru Telescope and Gaidos, et al.

It still won&#39;t shoot homing rounds, unfortunately, but the motorized blaster will shoot 10 darts in a row from a rapid-fire drum.

The social network apparently didn&#39;t have nearly enough resources to deal with the spread of harmful material in the populous country, and didn&#39;t respond with enough action when tensions flared.</p><p>A case study from early 2021 indicated that much of the harmful content from groups like Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Bajrang Dal wasn&#39;t flagged on Facebook or WhatsApp due to the lack of technical know-how needed to spot content written in Bengali and Hindi. At the same time, Facebook reportedly declined to mark the RSS for removal due to &quot;political sensitivities,&quot; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hesitated-to-remove-india-extremists-184615994.html">Bajrang Dal</a> (linked to Prime Minister Modi&#39;s party) hadn&#39;t been touched despite an internal Facebook call to take down its material. The company had a white list for politicians exempt from fact-checking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook was struggling to fight hate speech as recently as five months ago, according to the leaked data. And like an earlier test in the US, the research showed just how quickly Facebook&#39;s recommendation engine suggested toxic content. A dummy account following Facebook&#39;s recommendations for three weeks was subjected to a &quot;near constant barrage&quot; of divisive nationalism, misinformation and violence.</p><p>As with earlier scoops, Facebook said the leaks didn&#39;t tell the whole story. Spokesman Andy Stone argued the data was incomplete and didn&#39;t account for third-party fact checkers used heavily outside the US.  He added that Facebook had invested heavily in hate speech detection technology in languages like Bengali and Hindi, and that the company was continuing to improve that tech.</p><p>The social media firm followed this by <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/approach-to-countries-at-risk/">posting</a> a lengthier defense of its practices. It argued that it had an &quot;industry-leading process&quot; for reviewing and prioritizing countries with a high risk of violence every six months. It noted that teams considered long-term issues and history alongside current events and dependence on its apps. The company added it was engaging with local communities, improving technology and continuously &quot;refining&quot; policies.</p><p>The response didn&#39;t directly address some of the concerns, however. India is Facebook&#39;s largest individual market, with 340 million people using its services, but 87 percent of Facebook&#39;s misinformation budget is focused on the US. Even with third-party fact checkers at work, that suggests India isn&#39;t getting a proportionate amount of attention. Facebook also didn&#39;t follow up on worries it was tip-toeing around certain people and groups beyond a previous statement that it enforced its policies without consideration for position or association. In other words, it&#39;s not clear Facebook&#39;s problems with misinformation and violence will improve in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-violence-india-leak-221447186.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">301568f8-24e4-4ac8-a007-48c9b60d831f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 22:14:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635164601</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T12:23:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3f85d2e0-3447-11ec-bfff-d2c4c40cdbc3" width="3106" height="2067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3f85d2e0-3447-11ec-bfff-d2c4c40cdbc3" width="3106" height="2067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MANJUNATH KIRAN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A policeman (R) chases people walking around the clamped area of Devara Jevana Halli in Bangalore on August 13, 2020, after a "derogatory" Facebook post about the Prophet Mohammed sparked riots. - Two people died after a "derogatory" Facebook post about the Prophet Mohammed sparked riots in India's IT hub Bangalore that saw clashes between police and thousands of protesters, authorities said August 12.

However, the country has been moving relatively slowly. It only opened its first renewable energy plant in April, and its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-approves-vineyard-offshore-wind-130441299.html">wind farm</a> in August. It&#39;s still planning its first hydrogen fuel plant.</p><p>The conservative schedule isn&#39;t surprising. Although Saudi Arabia has been diversifying its economy, oil and gas <a href="https://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/about_us/169.htm">represent</a> about 50 percent of the country&#39;s gross domestic product and 70 percent of its exports.

I tracked my twin’s daily habits with the Talli one-touch tracker and liked it more than I thought I would, plus Cherlynn Low found that she wasn’t totally sold on Microsoft’s latest Surface Duo 2 folding smartphone.</p><h2>Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">still struggling</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ba6d8380-3204-11ec-bd5b-227f37b87019" style="height:1182;width:2100;" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 stands almost closed, with the logo on its back facing the camera." data-uuid="92ca33ff-74e3-31a2-a40e-2b54f2a4b8f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low admits right away that the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/2ZfQS2Y">Surface Duo 2</a> is a frustrating device, despite upgrades to the cameras, software and performance. At $1,500, it remains a pricey and niche foldable phone. The newest version offers a combined 8.3-inch screen and it runs Android 11. Cherlynn says the hardware is attractive with an impressively thin profile and a sleek silhouette. The unique 1,892 x 1,344 resolution produced some odd aspect ratios, but overall, apps expanded to cover the whole screen when the automatic-span setting was enabled.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Cherlynn liked the 90Hz refresh rate, the lovely AMOLED panels and the video quality, she was disappointed that the Duo 2 didn’t have any functionality when closed since, unlike competing smartphones, it doesn’t have an external screen. She also experienced occasional software issues: the system periodically required repeated taps to register, and the UI was finicky with swipe-based navigation. But she was most let down by the camera, which disables the rear shooters depending on the position of the phone. In the end, she could only recommend the device to those who really need a dual-screen phone and have $1,500 to spare.</p><h2>AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-gpu-120013965.html">shouldn’t be your first pick</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/becc4a80-3298-11ec-b5bf-4f19b4004bb0" alt="AMD Radeon RX 6600 " data-uuid="54e83c91-a234-3d6f-92fc-b9b5ed7f2ecd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>In his review of the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6600">Radeon RX 6600</a>, Devindra Hardawar wonders who this GPU is for. Although the card has speedy 1080p load performance, its ray tracing was lackluster at best, its upscaling abilities are limited and it has fewer features than competing cards from NVIDIA. This makes it difficult to recommend, particularly because there’s no way to estimate how much the card will cost due to the global chip shortage and ballooning prices.</p><p>During testing, Devindra found the RX 6600 to be a capable gaming card. It reached 120FPS in <em>Destiny 2 </em>with maxed out graphics, but stumbled when he pushed the game to 1440p. Similarly, during the <em>Hitman 3 </em>benchmark, the GPU reached a respectable 138fps in 1080p, but again faltered once Devindra pushed it to 1440p. He says the RX 6600 could be an upgrade for some because of its Smart Access Memory, which allows your CPU to directly address your video card&#39;s RAM. Otherwise, he says the GPU can only compete if the market stabilizes and the price drops below $300.</p><h2>The Portal Go brings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html">Facebook video chat all over your house</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/230814c0-3299-11ec-b9b9-74ac8ff36e6b" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="1c3beb45-536b-32e0-8a62-632fa00590a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicole Lee/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nicole Lee approves of the design updates made to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Facebook’s Portal Go</a>, which now features a grey fabric enclosure and rounded corners. The improvements make the Go easy to prop up on a lap or hold while you walk around the house. Part tablet and part smart display, the Go touts smart camera tracking via the 12-megapixel wide-angle lens that uses AI-powered technology to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame. This makes it easier to get several people in the picture on a call, and it works in third-party apps as well.</p><p>Nicole says she was impressed by the video capabilities of the 10.1-inch display, which has the same 1,280 x 800 resolution as previous Portal devices. She was particularly pleased by the adaptive lighting features like Night Mode, which reduces the amount of blue light in the evening. It also provides decent audio thanks to its two full-range speakers and subwoofer, so it can double as a portable speaker in a pinch. Nicole also managed to squeeze a little over six hours out of the battery — more than the company’s claims of five. Despite this, she says the Go is your best choice only if Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are your primary video call services.</p><h2>Talli’s one-touch tracker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-talli-baby-tracker-is-a-one-touch-system-for-logging-kids-activities-130022927.html">makes it easy to log kids habits</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/49a94d60-3299-11ec-bff8-f2fcd3e50846" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="4c81d24c-6b38-302b-8d2a-53518a583371"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Talli Baby</div></figure><p>Although I like the app I use to track my twins&#39; daily habits, I was curious about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Talli&#x002019;s dedicated hardware" href="https://fave.co/3AXz8pW">Talli’s dedicated hardware</a>. A sleek box with eight buttons , the Talli is intended to help busy parents track their kids&#39; stats with a single button press. I have to admit: I found it a lot more useful than I thought I would. Being able to push a button to log a medication or a bottle without having to open my phone, launch an app and enter in details was a welcome relief.</p><p>The Talli tracker also pairs with an app that records and graphs your child’s daily activities. The app is standalone, meaning you don&#39;t have to buy the physical tracker to use it, and there&#39;s no subscription required in order to access features or data. If you get the device, it runs on AA batteries and can be left freestanding or be wall mounted. I’ll admit I had a challenging time trying to find the exact right location for the Talli. Grabbing it often resulted in an accidental button press, but that didn’t diminish its usefulness. It can also work alongside an Alexa skill enabling parents to log events by saying “Alexa, tell Talli Baby that Sam had a bottle.” At $99, it’s a bit pricey for a single-function device, but if you’re looking to establish a routine of recording your baby’s habits, it can make things more convenient.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-microsofts-surface-duo-2-still-needs-some-work-160035942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69b43ea5-761a-458d-b6d5-abca6eeb9632</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 16:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634842914</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T19:02:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page.

Available from Basic Books, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>The first archaeological evidence that people were dairying dates to around 8,500 years ago — 2,000 years after cattle domestication. In Anatolia (present-day eastern Turkey), which is pretty far from the original center of cattle domestication, archaeologists recovered milk fat residues from ceramic pots, indicating that people were processing milk by heating it up. Similar analyses of milk fat proteins in ceramics record the spread of dairying into Europe, which appears to have happened simultaneously with the spread of domestic cattle.</p><p>It’s not surprising that people began dairying soon after cattle domestication. Milk is the primary source of sugar, fat, vitamins, and protein for newborn mammals, and as such is evolved expressly to be nutritious. It would not have taken much imagination for a cattle herder to deduce that a cow’s milk would be just as good for him and his family as it was for her calf. The only challenge would have been digesting it—without the lactase persistence mutation, that is.</p><p>Because lactase persistence allows people to take advantage of calories from lactose, it also makes sense that the spread of the lactase persistence mutation and the spread of dairying would be tightly linked. If the mutation arose near the start of dairying or was already present in a population that acquired dairying technology, the mutation would have given those who had it an advantage over those who did not. Those with the mutation would, with access to additional resources from milk, more efficiently convert animal protein into more people, and the mutation would increase in frequency.</p><p>Curiously, though, ancient DNA has not found the lactase persistence mutation in the genomes of early dairy farmers, and the mutation is at its lowest European frequency today in the precise part of the world where dairying began. The first dairy farmers were not, it seems, drinking milk. Instead, they were processing milk by cooking or fermenting it, making cheeses and sour yogurts to remove the offending indigestible sugars.</p><p>If people can consume dairy products without the lactase persistence mutation, there must be some other explanation as to why the mutation is so prevalent today. And lactase persistence is remarkably prevalent. Nearly a third of us have lactase persistence, and at least five different mutations have evolved—all on the same stretch of intron 13 of the MCM6 gene—that make people lactase persistent. In each case, these mutations have gone to high frequency in the populations in which they evolved, indicating that they provide an enormous evolutionary advantage. Is being able to drink milk (in addition to eating cheese and yogurt) sufficient to explain why these mutations have been so important?</p><p>The most straightforward hypothesis is that, yes, the benefit of lactase persistence is tied to lactose, the sugar that represents about 30 percent of the calories in milk. Only those who can digest lactose have access to these calories, which may have been crucial calories during famines, droughts, and disease. Milk may also have provided an important source of clean water, which also may have been limited during periods of hardship.</p><p>Another hypothesis is that milk drinking provided access to calcium and vitamin D in addition to lactose, the complement of which aids calcium absorption. This might benefit particular populations with limited access to sunlight, as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is necessary to stimulate the body’s production of vitamin D. However, while this might explain the high frequency of lactase persistence in places like northern Europe, it cannot explain why populations in relatively sunny climates, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East, also have high frequencies of lactase persistence.</p><p>Neither this hypothesis nor the more straightforward hypothesis linked to lactase can explain why lactase persistence is at such low frequency in parts of Central Asia and Mongolia where herding, pastoralism, and dairying have been practiced for millennia. For now, the jury is still out as to why lactase persistence has reached such high frequencies in so many different parts of the world, and why it remains at low frequencies in some regions where dairying is economically and culturally important.</p><p>Ancient DNA has shed some light on when and where the lactase persistence mutation arose and spread in Europe. None of the remains from pre-Neolithic archaeological sites—economies that relied on hunting and gathering—have the lactase persistence mutation. None of the ancient Europeans from early farming populations in southern and central Europe (people believed to be descended from farmers spreading into Europe from Anatolia) had the lactase persistence mutation. Instead, the oldest evidence of the lactase persistence mutation in Europe is from a 4,350-year-old individual from central Europe. Around that same time, the mutation is found in a single individual from what is now Sweden and at two sites in northern Spain. While these data are sparse, the timing is coincident with another major cultural upheaval in Europe: the arrival of Asian pastoralists of the Yamnaya culture. Perhaps the Yamnaya brought with them not only horses, wheels, and a new language, but an improved ability to digest milk.</p><p>The mystery of lactase persistence in humans highlights the complicated interaction among genes, environment, and culture. The initial increase in frequency of a lactase persistence mutation, regardless of in whom it first arose, may have happened by chance. When the Yamnaya arrived in Europe, for example, they brought disease—specifically plague—that devastated native European populations. When populations are small, genes can drift quickly to higher frequency regardless of what benefit they might provide. If the lactase persistence mutation was already present when plague appeared and populations crashed, the mutation’s initial increase may have happened surreptitiously. When populations recovered, dairying was already widespread and the benefit to those with the mutation would have been immediate. By domesticating cattle and developing dairying technologies, our ancestors created an environment that changed the course of our own evolution.</p><p>We continue to live and evolve in this human-constructed niche. In 2018, our global community produced 830 million metric tons (more than 21 billion US gallons) of milk, 82 percent of which was from cattle. The rest comes from a long list of other species that people domesticated within the last 10,000 years. Sheep and goats, which together make up around 3 percent of global milk production, were first farmed for their milk in Europe around the same time as cattle dairying began. Buffaloes were domesticated in the Indus Valley 4,500 years ago and are today the second largest producer of milk next to cattle, producing around 14 percent of the global supply. Camels, which were domesticated in Central Asia 5,000 years ago, produce around 0.3 percent of the world’s milk supply. People also consume milk from horses, which were first milked by people of the Botai culture 5,500 years ago; yaks, which were domesticated in Tibet 4,500 years ago; donkeys, which were domesticated in Arabia or East Africa 6,000 years ago; and reindeer, which are still in the process of being domesticated. But those are just the most common dairy products. Dairy products from more exotic species—moose, elk, red deer, alpacas, llamas—can be purchased and consumed today, and rumor has it that Top Chef ’s Edward Lee is working out how to make pig milk ricotta, should one want to try such a thing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-life-as-we-made-it-beth-shapiro-hachette-book-group-153038211.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08d4fbf9-7de4-46fc-bb69-b013d42f0403</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 15:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634247186</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:33:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nutrition]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/608d4e50-0298-11eb-9efb-7e07d29328eb" width="6508" height="4337" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/608d4e50-0298-11eb-9efb-7e07d29328eb" width="6508" height="4337" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clara Bastian via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cows together gathering in the pasture, funny and joyful and a blue cloudy sky.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Group of cows together gathering in a field, happy and joyful and a blue cloudy sky.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile postpones Sprint 3G shutdown to March 31st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile will wait a while longer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-fcc-letter-t-mobile-212911598.html">shut down Sprint&#39;s 3G network</a>. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22741762/tmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost">reports</a> T-Mobile has <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/update-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans">delayed</a> the CDMA network shutdown from January 1st, 2022 to March 31st of that year.

The satellite TV provider <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-acquires-boost-mobile-wireless-carrier-171217646.html">bought Boost Mobile</a> from T-Mobile in July 2020 and planned to use Sprint&#39;s legacy network until it could move Boost customers to its 5G service. Dish argued this didn&#39;t give it enough time to migrate its customers, and accused T-Mobile of anti-competitive behavior meant to push Boost exiles to T-Mobile.</p><p>This may be a response to both Dish&#39;s original accusation and the ensuing fallout. The Justice Department told Dish and T-Mobile <a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481">in July</a> that it had serious concerns about the Sprint network shutdown, asking the two companies to do whatever was necessary to lessen the blow. The delay might address those worries and reduce the chances of more serious government scrutiny.</p><p>A delayed shutdown still isn&#39;t ideal. T-Mobile expects to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-lte-101022638.html">shutter Sprint&#39;s LTE network</a> on June 30th, 2022. This leaves a three-month window where Boost customers might have LTE access, but nothing else. While you&#39;ll probably have made a decision by the March cutoff if you&#39;re a customer, this won&#39;t be a very gradual shift for some users — they&#39;ll have just a short period of limited Boost service before they have to embrace 5G.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-3g-cdma-shutdown-delay-151546831.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5411914b-eac7-4b05-bbda-47ed06ce7d89</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 15:15:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635002148</ingested><modified>2021-10-23T15:15:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65f06cf0-340c-11ec-9f87-cbaf90294e22" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65f06cf0-340c-11ec-9f87-cbaf90294e22" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, UNITED STATES - 2020/01/23: American telecommunications company Sprint logo seen at one of their stores.

Sure, OS X was intriguing, and the titanium PowerBook was definitely a cool computer, But when most people thought of Apple, it was probably the bulbous, colorful iMac G3 that popped into people’s heads. The company was starting to build its reputation for truly desirable products, but it wasn’t solidified just yet.</p><p>That all changed <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/10/23Apple-Presents-iPod/">on October 23, 2001</a>, when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPod out of his pocket. For a generation of music fans, it became the quintessentially cool item that was more than just a fad. It’s not a stretch to say it reinvented the music industry while simultaneously paving a path for Apple to become the world’s biggest company. It was the ultimate gateway drug to getting people who had never bought an Apple product before to see what all the fuss was about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d5715c51f47d47d883d9a890df5b6c71"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mc_FiHTITHE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>At this point, the somewhat skeptical reception to the iPod is part of tech industry lore – particularly Slashdot’s <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-ipod">dismissal of the product</a> as “lame” compared to a Nomad MP3 player. (Raise your hand if you ever used a Nomad. That’s what I thought.) And it’s not like the product was an instant hit – the first iPod cost $400 and only worked with the Mac, two factors that limited its appeal.</p><div id="91fb110a046c42679f9d5019e9e9f30e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mE_bDNaYAr8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Those limitations helped it achieve some serious&nbsp;cachet, though. Seeing an iPod in the wild was a rarity, and my Mac-owning friends who were early adopters had to deal with my incessant questions and requests to hold it and spin its distinctive wheel. It didn’t help that my college suite-mate (who had a titanium PowerBook and iPod) and graphic designer friend (with a PowerMac G4 and iPod) were constantly going off about how great their hardware was. I was primed to become one of those switchers Apple liked to talk about in the early 2000s.</p><p>The iPod may have started out as a Mac-only product, but less than a year later, Apple opened it up to the other 98 percent of computer users by introducing a Windows-compatible model in the summer of 2002. Less than a year after that, Apple completely redesigned the iPod and released a new version of iTunes for Windows. At the same time, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265172/itunes-store-at-10-how-apple-built-a-digital-media-juggernaut">launched the iTunes Music Store</a>, making it a lot easier to get legal music onto an iPod. With that, the iPod moved fully into the mainstream.</p><p>There’s no good way to quantify how many people bought an iPod for Windows and then eventually switched to a Mac. But, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/222361/apple-by-the-numbers-mac-not-dead-yet-2.html">Mac sales increased</a> from about 3 million in 2003 to more than 7 million by 2007. Apple’s move to more powerful Intel processors in 2005 likely helped adoption, but the iPod “halo effect” was often cited in the mid-2000s as a driver of the Mac’s increasing popularity.</p><p>Growing Mac sales and the most popular consumer electronics device of the decade truly paved the way for the iPhone to be the monumental success that it was almost. Sure, the iPhone eventually killed the iPod, but <a href="https://gigaom.com/2007/09/05/419-steve-jobs-on-iphone-cannibals-nbc/">as Steve Jobs said</a>, he’d rather cannibalize Apple&#39;s sales with another Apple product than let some other company do it — this was how he justified the existence of the iPod touch, which was basically an iPhone without a phone.</p><div id="a9215a553b4e4f019aa2634876ed3d82"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OvHz2aIZozA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>I might be overselling the iPod to Mac to iPhone evolution, because I lived it. After getting a second-generation iPod in 2002 (embarrassing admission time: I also bought four more full-size iPods between then and 2009), I got my first Mac in 2003 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-07-03-iphone-review-part-1-hardware-interface-keyboard.html">the first iPhone</a> in late 2007. I remember being more excited about my first iPhone than my first iPod, mostly because it was light years better than the Moto RAZR I was using at the time. But my first iPod was similarly a huge step forward from the MP3 players I owned before. And in my early 20s, there was nothing more important to me than music.</p><p>That may not make me unique, but it’s still true. Before the iPod was everywhere, someone else who had one was someone you could trust. They took music as seriously as you did; they knew how liberating it was to have your 100 favorite albums with you, on demand, any time you needed them. In a world where Apple Music offers access to 90 million songs anywhere you are for 10 bucks a month, that might seem quaint. But 20 years ago, it was a revelation.</p><p>I still have the last iPod I ever purchased, a 2008 iPod classic with 120GB of storage – about the same space as I have in my iPhone 12 Pro. It’s still stuffed to the gills with music, some 11,000-plus songs, most of which come from albums  I carefully selected over time. Most of them are still in my Apple Music library, which has now ballooned to more than double that size, with over 25,000 songs.</p><p>I’m still a firm believer in the art of making a good album, but I’ve also collected thousands of singles, or a handful of songs from artists who catch my ear on one of the many curated playlists out there. The music industry has changed, and so have I. Whether or not that’s a good thing is a debate for another time, but there’s no doubt that both the music and technology industries changed completely because of the iPod – something its humble introduction 20 years ago only barely hinted at.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipod-20th-anniversary-140004112.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7c38fb85-ad45-44b6-9c77-0bde93a3c3bf</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634935103</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T20:38:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4cc948a0-3376-11ec-bd7f-99ba52d26aa6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4cc948a0-3376-11ec-bd7f-99ba52d26aa6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's iPod Classic music player (2008 model).]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPod Classic]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
