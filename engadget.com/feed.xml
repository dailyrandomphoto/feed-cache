It will require companies to give government agencies detailed descriptions of the targets workers are expected to meet, along with the repercussions of missing them. If it becomes law, it would also prohibit quotas that force workers to skip safety techniques or anything that prevents them from having state-mandated meal or toilet breaks. While AB-701 covers all warehouse owners, its proponents targeted Amazon, in particular.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill&#39;s author, California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/08/1034776936/amazon-warehouse-workers-speed-quotas-california-bill">said</a> that she and the bill&#39;s other backers are &quot;absolutely targeting the practices of Amazon that are being picked up... by other retailers. Amazon drew flak after workers spoke out about the enormous productivity expectations they have to meet, forcing them to skip breaks to be able to keep up. Further, because they&#39;re expected to move as fast as the machines they&#39;re working with, repetitive strain injuries are a huge issue.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3375e47d-107c-4a50-9cec-3b7b7dbd820c"><em>Financial Times</em></a> notes, Amazon&#39;s rate of injury is more than double that of the national warehousing industry average, based on figures submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Eric Frumin, director of health and safety for the Strategic Organizing Center, told the publication: &quot;If Amazon complies with the law, workers will now have an unparalleled ability to fight back against abusive workloads.&quot;</p><p>AB-701 passed despite fierce opposition from business and trade groups. Rachel Michelin, the president of the California Retailers Association, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-09-08/california-bill-ab701-passes-senate-warehouse-work-metrics-algorithims-regulation">warned</a> that consumers will pay the price if it becomes a law, as it would apparently increase manufacturing, storage and distribution costs. Meanwhile, the bill&#39;s supporters believe there&#39;s more to be done, especially since they had to remove some provisions to get those on the fence to vote for it. One of the provisions they killed would require Cal/OSHA to create a rule aiming to minimize musculoskeletal injuries among workers.</p><p>The bill is pending final approval this week in the Assembly, which is usually just a formality. After that, it&#39;s in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who can either sign it into law or veto it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-passes-ab-701-054011017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f0210e1-4ac7-4c34-b77a-4936fd7c2a6f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 05:40:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631166059</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T05:41:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcecee40-1129-11ec-b7b5-1ce414681bdb" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcecee40-1129-11ec-b7b5-1ce414681bdb" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chokii Ns via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Inventory.

Now with the $849 Roomba j7+, the company is ready to take on its greatest challenge yet: Pet poop. It&#39;s iRobot&#39;s first vacuum that can recognize and avoid obstacles, like cables or a pile of clothes, in real-time. And for pet owners, that could finally be reason to adopt a robot vacuum.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b06260e8-b950-4a1c-8596-6295b327203b"/><p>After all, you can&#39;t exactly trust your bot to clean up while you&#39;re away if they could run into surprises from your furry friends. That&#39;s a disaster that could lead to poop being spread around your home, not to mention gumming up your expensive bot. To alleviate that concern, iRobot is making a Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.): If your j7+ runs into poop within your first year of ownership, the company will replace your vacuum. That should go a long way towards making pet parents feel more comfortable with a Roomba. (It would be nice to see that offer extended beyond just one year, though.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the j7+ is technically the smartest Roomba yet, it&#39;s not the company&#39;s most powerful cleaner. That honor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-29-irobot-roomba-s9-bravaa-jet-m6.html">still belongs to the $1,299 s9+</a>. This new model is basically <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-05-roomba-i7-plus-review.html">the Roomba i7+</a> with a more powerful camera, better sensors and far more processing power. It can also automatically empty its bin into a redesigned Clean Base, which is shorter and sleeker than the previous models we&#39;ve seen.  Now you should be able tuck it into an inobtrusive corner, or under a table, instead of dedicating floorspace to a tall iRobot monolith.</p><p>With its &quot;PrecisionVision Navigation&quot; — iRobot&#39;s marketing term for AI-driven computer vision — the j7+ can detect specific objects, as well as alert you to obstalces in the iRobot app after a cleaning job. You can label them as permanent or temporary obstructions, which helps the vacuum learn how to deal with similar issues in the future. If there&#39;s a pile of cords that will always be in one corner, the j7+ will just stop cleaning around that area for good. But if it&#39;s just a headphone cord that you&#39;ve dropped onto the floor, the robot can give that area another go on future jobs. And since it can actually see and interpret your rooms, the j7+ will also be able to clean more gently along walls and furniture.</p><p>As it&#39;s relying on computer vision, iRobot had to train new models to help the j7+ recognize objects from floor level (there aren&#39;t too many other devices with a camera down there). At this point, CEO Colin Angle tells us that it can recognize and a pair of corded headphones on the ground, but eventually it&#39;ll handle shoes and socks as well. When it comes to recognizing pet poop, the company captured photos using playdough models, as well as images from employees, to build what&#39;s surely one of the most unique machine learning models around.</p><p>iRobot plans to bring the j7+&#39;s sensors  to future models, Angle says, but it wanted to introduce them in something more people could buy. As much as I like the pricey s9+, it&#39;s not a wise purchase when there are cheaper self-cleaning Roombas around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" style="height:1621;width:2048;" alt="iRobot Roomba j7+" data-uuid="c971680f-9456-31c2-a233-caf710a9692f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">iRobot</div></figure><p>The j7+ is powered by iRobot&#39;s new Genius 3.0 software, which will also roll out to the rest of the company&#39;s connected vacuums. That builds on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">features introduced last year</a> — which includes a better mobile app, smarter scheduling and routine triggers — by adding cleaning time estimates, as well as the ability to automatically clean while you&#39;re away. The new OS smarts will also let Roombas automatically suggest room labels as they map out your home. And if you send you intrepid bot to clean one room, it&#39;ll be able to move throughout your home quietly until it reaches the work zone.</p><p>While I haven&#39;t tried out the j7+ yet, it&#39;s clear that iRobot is targeting a persistent issue with robot vacuums: trust. Early Roombas required plenty of babysitting, otherwise they could easily get stuck or jammed. These days, I habitually clear out my floors before I start a vacuum run, because even newer models can get into trouble. If iRobot can actually develop a vacuum bot that can deal with obstacles on its own, it may finally have the ideal device for people who hate cleaning. At the very least, it&#39;d be nice to have something I can trust to avoid my cat&#39;s poop.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8ad2ea9-9482-4868-95cf-b40280d5c0fd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 04:01:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631128836</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T19:20:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a5bbd0-10d7-11ec-b6d6-cc025fdbd8b2" width="2047" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a5bbd0-10d7-11ec-b6d6-cc025fdbd8b2" width="2047" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Star Trek: Picard' takes us to an alternate reality in February 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html"><em>Picard</em></a> picked up many years after the destruction of Romulus with a much darker, more depressing Federation.

The streaming service has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL9aJcqrtnw">posted</a> a teaser trailer for <em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em>, a satire where &quot;star-studded cast&quot; is an understatement. The movie stars Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio as a grad student and professor who try desperately to warn the public of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-05-27-nasa-asteroid-mission-could-explain-how-life-began-and-how-ours.html">life-ending comet</a> in an era where 24-hour news and social media lead to gnat-like attention spans.

The company is now starting to test <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/testing-communities">Communities</a>, “a more intimate space for conversations” on the platform.</p><p>Communities, which the company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-test-communities-tipping-super-follows-183101868.html">teased</a> back in February, are sort of like Twitter’s version of a subreddit or a public-facing group on Facebook. Communities are dedicated to specific topics, and members can post tweets to a dedicated group timeline. Each community has its own moderators who set rules for the group, and users must be invited by an existing member or moderator to participate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature is meant to address what’s been a long-running issue for the platform: that it can be incredibly difficult for new users to wade through the noise and find the corner of Twitter that speaks to their interests. The company has tried to address this with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-twitter-topics-live.html">Topics</a>, which injects tweets into your timeline based on your interests, but Communities takes the idea a step further.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/313b9be0-10c3-11ec-9edf-1b6598f373da" alt="Communities are for more " data-uuid="c78014fd-c07e-3b9b-9d25-b64dfa907a54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Twitter notes that some of its first Communities will focus on popular topics like skincare, astrology, sneakers and dogs, but that over time it expects the groups to reflect the more “niche discussions” that happen on the platform. For now, Twitter is starting with just a handful of Communities, though moderators and members are able to invite anyone to join. The company says it plans to open up the feature for more users to create Communities in the “coming months.”</p><p>Notably, Twitter seems to be trying to avoid some of the issues that have plagued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html">Facebook’s Groups</a>. All Communities are publicly accessible and viewable by anyone on the platform —there’s no such thing as a private or “secret” Community — though only members can participate in the discussion directly. Like Reddit and Facebook, Twitter will also rely on admins and moderators to steer the day-to-day conversations and keep members in check. The company is also working on new reporting and detection features to weed out “potentially problematic” groups that may spring up.</p><p>Though the company is calling the feature a test, Twitter seems to be quite serious about its potential. Communities is getting its own tab in the center of Twitter’s app, between explore and notifications, which suggests the company plans for Communities to be a prominent feature of its platform for the long term.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-communities-170039437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">720f6ee3-4170-41e0-b6eb-ca1fda5a5f79</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631124918</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T18:15:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is testing communities, its new subreddit like feature for groups.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter communities]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fake pro-China accounts tried to push Americans to attend anti-racism protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, security researchers from Google and cybersecurity firm Mandiant disclosed that a network of fake pro-China social media accounts tried to mobilize Americans to attend anti-racism protests in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/09/pro-prc-influence-campaign-social-media-websites-forums.html"><ins>report the two organizations published</ins></a>, the network “did not appear to achieve any success,” but in one instance it tried to push Asian-Americans to attend an April 24th protest that sought to “fight back” against claims the virus was engineered in a Chinese lab.</p><p>They did not directly attribute the campaign to the Chinese government. However, John Hultquist, vice president of analysis at Mandiant, told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-china-online-network-used-fake-accounts-to-urge-asian-americans-to-attend-protests-researchers-say-11631109601"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>the operation was “almost certainly supported by a government sponsor, either directly through a government agency or a third-party contractor.” Additionally, the scale of the campaign suggests the network had significant resources at its disposal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers say the campaign may suggest an intention to motivate real-world action outside of the borders of China. At the very least, the scope of the activity is far broader than previous efforts this network has conducted. In 2019, it was linked to efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-youtube-hong-kong.html">discredit the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong</a>.</p><p>This time around, they did not limit their efforts merely to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Instead, they cast a wide net, creating accounts across more than 30 social media platforms and 40 additional websites and “niche” forums, including places like LiveJournal and Vimeo. They also tried to reach a global audience by posting in Russian, German, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, in addition to Chinese and English.</p><p>&quot;Over the past two years, we have seen this threat actor evolve, from the types of content they publish to the tactics they use to amplify it. However, the most significant features of this network remain its scale and persistence, in spite of low engagement levels,” Shane Huntley, the director of Google’s Threat Analysis Group, told Engadget. “... We anticipate they will continue to experiment to drive higher engagement and encourage others in the community to continue tracking this actor, shedding light on their operations and taking action against them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pro-china-fake-network-anti-asian-american-hate-protests-164004929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61caf576-a6c0-4f38-8a2d-f612f2403ee6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 16:40:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631119216</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T16:40:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bdf94b0-10c1-11ec-bc54-61260e4ef907" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bdf94b0-10c1-11ec-bc54-61260e4ef907" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARLIAMENT SQUARE, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/07/24: A demonstrator wearing Chinese traditional jacket holds a placard  outside Parliament Square during the Stop Asian Hate rally in London.

Its most recent game is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-13-the-persistence.html"><em><ins>The Persistence</ins></em></a>, a survival horror title that hit consoles and PC last year after debuting on PlayStation VR.</p><p>The Firesprite team is working on <em>something</em> new, but it&#39;s not entirely clear what.

The set-up supports a range of up to 1,000 feet so you can check in on them from anywhere in the house, and the 2,900mAh battery runs for 15-hours so the display won’t run out of juice overnight. It will also provide you with sound alerts and two way audio, and since it’s not connected to WiFi, you don’t have to worry about anyone hacking into it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eufys-space-view-baby-monitor-is-22-percent-off-on-amazon-150458581.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a45f2dd6-3243-4335-b607-410dba2dc44c</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 15:04:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631113501</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:07:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/496af1c0-1a0b-11eb-bf7e-28ad3e1987d0" width="640" height="416" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/496af1c0-1a0b-11eb-bf7e-28ad3e1987d0" width="640" height="416" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eufy Spaceview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eufy Spaceview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senator Warren urges Amazon to tackle COVID-19 misinformation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A month before the <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/covid-19"><ins>COVID-19</ins></a> pandemic shut down much of the West in March 2020, Amazon pledged to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-amazon-removes-coronavirus-listings.html"><ins>remove products</ins></a> that claimed to cure the coronavirus. However, items that promote misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines are still appearing in search results on the Amazon storefront, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>The senator&#39;s staff found that searches for terms including “COVID-19,” “COVID,” “vaccine,” “COVID-19 vaccine” and “pandemic” led to results such as books peddling &quot;falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines and cures,&quot; including at least one that Amazon tagged as a best seller. Engadget was able to replicate some of the search results Warren flagged.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.9.7%20Letter%20to%20Amazon%20on%20COVID%20Misinformation.pdf">a letter to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy</a>, which was spotted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/elizabeth-warren-asks-amazon-ceo-to-crack-down-on-covid-misinformation.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>, Warren urged the company to review Amazon&#39;s algorithms. She called on Jassy to, within 14 days, detail a plan to modify the algorithms so they no longer turn up products that include COVID-19 misinformation, and to release a public report on &quot;the extent to which Amazon’s algorithms are directing consumers&quot; to such items at the moment.</p><p>In addition, Warren sought clarification on Amazon&#39;s current policies about those products and what the company has done to tackle the spread of false information. She also wants to know more details about the best-seller tag, and why books containing COVID-19 misinformation are being awarded the label.</p><p>Warren acknowledged that Amazon has provided its users with resources for accurate information about COVID-19, including prominent links to the Food and Drug Administration website. Her staff see any instances of Amazon displaying sponsored search results for pandemic-related terms either. However, she said her team&#39;s findings were otherwise &quot;deeply troubling.&quot;</p><p>“As cases of COVID-19 continue to rise, Amazon is feeding misinformation loops through its search and ‘Best Seller’ algorithms, potentially leading countless Americans to risk their health and the health of their neighbors based on misleading and inaccurate information that they discover on Amazon’s website,&quot; Warren wrote.

The agency now <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-readies-james-webb-space-telescope-for-december-launch">plans to launch</a> the telescope on December 18th, 2021, just a few months after testing completed in late August. The hardware will reach orbit aboard an ESA-supplied Ariane 5 rocket lifting off from French Guiana. NASA still has to ship the telescope to the launchpad, although much of the rocket has already arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>The JWST was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">deemed complete</a> in 2016 ahead of an expected 2018 launch, but faced a number of delays due to its elaborate construction. It wasn&#39;t assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">until 2019</a>, and factors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coronavirus-delays-launch-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-161528305.html">like the COVID-19 pandemic</a> further hindered NASA&#39;s efforts. That&#39;s not including earlier setbacks — development started in 1996 with an expected 2007 deployment, but the team scrapped much of its work and redesigned the equipment in 2005.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The telescope&#39;s importance hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s considered the successor to the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html"> Hubble Space Telescope</a>. It includes a much larger mirror along with a focus on lower-frequency observations (particularly mid-infrared) that will help it detect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-07-sounds-of-oldest-stars-in-milky-way-galaxy.html">early galaxies</a> that even Hubble can&#39;t find. That priority also helps explain some of its technical challenges. The JWST&#39;s instruments will need to stay extremely cold (-370F) to avoid interference with infrared measurements, requiring both a large sunshield and an insertion near a Sun-Earth Lagrange point.</p><p>The mission will be relatively short. As the JWST needs propellant to maintain orbit, it can&#39;t last indefinitely like a telescope circling Earth. NASA would consider a five-year lifespan &quot;nominal,&quot; although it&#39;s hoping for 10 years.</p><p>All the effort might just pay off. In addition to shedding more light on the early Universe, the JWST should also help astronomers and astrophysicists fill gaps in studies where Hubble wasn&#39;t enough. Infrared waves are more likely to cut through cosmic dust, and they&#39;re the primary radiation from cooler celestial bodies like brown dwarfs and planets. There&#39;s a very real chance the JWST will help solve a string of cosmic mysteries during its brief lifetime.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f8502fd-99d2-4800-b26d-9b97534e2e63</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 14:51:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631114021</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:13:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alex-mit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's first non-Quibi movie is a Christmas special]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roku is finally expanding its original content beyond a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-adds-more-quibi-shows-to-original-144530038.html">parade of Quibi shows</a>.

The feature will also send a &quot;chip&quot; to your computer if you&#39;d rather answer on the larger screen.</p><p>The company has pitched the feature as a rough equivalent to &quot;spontaneous&quot; office chats in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-sundar-pichai-hybrid-work-week-plan-225637951.html">hybrid work environment</a> where some staff are at home.

You&#39;ll now see Google&#39;s promised &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-open-everyone-free-spaces-100004157.html">spaces</a>,&quot; a renamed and expanded version of Rooms chat channels with full threaded messages and the option of making spaces visible in search. You can accordingly expect easier navigation between email, chats, spaces and Meet, not to mention improved admin and security tools to help manage communications. Enterprise users should see these changes starting today, but everyday Gmail owners will see updates later on.</p><p>Other tweaks include options to specify whether you&#39;re in-office or virtual on a given day (important for planning meetings) and a Companion mode for Meet that lets you use a conference room&#39;s audiovisual hardware. Google is expanding its Meet hardware ecosystem, too. There are two new Series One devices (third-party equipment made to fit Google&#39;s goals), including the Series One Desk 27 all-in-one and Series One Board 65 4K collaborative board. More gadgets are Meet-certified, too, such as Logitech&#39;s Rally Bar and Rally Bar Mini room solutions as well as the Rayz Rally Pro speaker dock.</p><div id="318314c2509d4985ba4a26c4399289c0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BR81EAce5BQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Google&#39;s ambitions for Gmail are fairly clear.

That&#39;s not surprising when Google is directly competing with Office. At the same time, it does raise questions about support for dedicated apps. What need is there for other clients when Gmail theoretically does it all? Still, you might not mind if it saves you from switching apps and potentially losing focus.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gmail-voice-calls-google-meet-133033634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28428001-53df-455d-98a4-d5ef09fa6499</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 13:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631107836</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T13:30:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-02/a63c6880-2704-11e9-aefe-56e5b64e7469" width="3969" height="2636" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/a63c6880-2704-11e9-aefe-56e5b64e7469" width="3969" height="2636" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Google Gmail mailing app is seen on an Android portable device on February 5, 2018.

The site now offers no less than <a href="https://adtr.co/AnXANB">six new titles</a> in its store: <em>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</em> (2000), <em>Star Trek: Elite Force II</em> (2003), <em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander</em> (2002), <em>Star Trek: Starfleet command III</em> (2002), <em>Star Trek: Hidden Evil</em> (1999) and <em>Star Trek: Away Team</em> (2001). On top of that, GOG will soon add another two games, <em>Star Trek: Armada</em> and <em>Star Trek: Armada II</em>.</p><p>The additions help mark the 55th anniversary of the original show, along with the 100th birthday of the late Gene Roddenberry, GOG wrote. As it noted, the first text-based <em>Star Trek</em> computer games first appeared in 1971, &quot;with many official and even more unofficial releases appearing in arcades, on Apple I and II computers, various models of Atari, the Commodore 64 and all the way to DOS and Windows PCs&quot; — a testament to the staying power of the franchise.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7288e031d70645dc896093360af796cd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s time to boldly go where no man has gone before! 🌌<br><br>Grab Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force, Elite Force II, Star Trek: Bridge Commander, Star Trek: Starfleet Command III and more!<br><br>🖖 <a href="https://t.co/LkhGb8Qf1o">https://t.co/LkhGb8Qf1o</a><a href="https://t.co/CfGbGSpoqi">pic.twitter.com/CfGbGSpoqi</a></p>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/1435546972140748800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>So how do these games rank in the <em>Star Trek</em> pantheon? Games like <em>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-22-the-game-archaeologist-perpetuals-star-trek-online.html"><em>Star Trek: Online</em></a> are perhaps better known, to be sure. But as <a href="https://www.gog.com/news/6_classic_star_trek_games_ready_to_beam_up_new_players_and_fans_alike">GOG writes</a>, &quot;an absolute golden era of Star Trek games began at the end of the ’90s and the beginning of the 2000s with new games landing every few months.&quot;</p><p>Particularly, <em>Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force</em> and <em>Star Trek: Bridge Commander</em> are considered to be some of the best <em>Star Trek</em> titles out there, as <a href="https://screenrant.com/best-star-trek-video-games-ranked/"><em>Screen Rant</em></a> notes. Many of those titles have become unavailable and are unplayable on modern machines, as well. &quot;This changes now with [these games] releasing for the first time in digital distribution,&quot; GOG said. All the games are <a href="https://adtr.co/AnXANB">now available</a> in the US (and elsewhere) for $10.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gog-now-lets-you-play-six-classic-star-trek-games-125037822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2e14c92-fdef-44d2-be48-8b462ffa83f5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 12:50:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631105679</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T12:54:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0d8a65d0-1098-11ec-afb4-3be5304415a9" width="1228" height="756" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0d8a65d0-1098-11ec-afb4-3be5304415a9" width="1228" height="756" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gigan85]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GOG's store adds six classic 'Star Trek' games]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GOG's store adds six classic 'Star Trek' games]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify opens up Release Radar for brand sponsorships, starting with Disney+]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-05-spotifys-release-radar-playlist-new-music.html">Release Radar</a> is one of the most popular algorithmically generated playlists on Spotify, and for good reason. The mix is updated weekly with a collection of new material from the artists you listen to often. The playlist has been keeping users in the loop for five years at this point, and now the streaming service is <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-09-08/spotifys-release-radar-personalized-playlist-celebrates-five-years-and-16-billion-streams/">opening it up to advertisers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is actually the third playlist Spotify has offered up for ads, joining <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-spotify-discover-weekly-brand-sponsorship.html">Discover Weekly</a> and On Repeat as potential sponsorship opportunities for brands. With Release Radar, Disney+ will be the first to jump on board in the US, promoting its Billie Eilish film <em>Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter To Los Angeles</em>. Spotify says free users will see ads in the form of audio, video and graphics and direct them to the playlist. Once inside, logos will appear on the playlist art along with messages from the sponsor at each ad break (audio and video). Along with music-focused advertisements, you&#39;ll likely see sponsorships from gaming, automotive, fashion and tech brands as well as phone service providers. However, Spotify explains the opportunity is open to all companies, not just those that fit in the aforementioned categories. As always, Premium users won&#39;t see, or hear, any of the sponsored content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Release Radar has a captive audience. The playlist has been streamed over 16 billion times globally since its launch in 2016. It&#39;s a a top-three personalized playlist for Spotify users in several regions, including North America, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Most listeners are 18-29 year olds, and Spotify says that group accounts for over 50 percent of Release Radar streaming.&nbsp;</p><p>Free users in the US should be seeing the Disney+ sponsorship on Release Radar soon, if you haven&#39;t already. If you stream on the ad-supported tier outside of the States, sponsored messages will appear for you as well: the playlist is available for brands to advertise in 31 markets around the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-release-radar-ads-120051401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7bd2c30e-4a34-4cce-aef6-c1a44ed46cee</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 12:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631044513</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T19:55:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/082f24f0-0fd9-11ec-af7e-61a9ea3dedfd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/082f24f0-0fd9-11ec-af7e-61a9ea3dedfd" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify Release Radar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify Release Radar]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
