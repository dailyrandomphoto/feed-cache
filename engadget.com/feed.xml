He calls it MetaWorld and describes it as a persistent, decentralized space filled with life and change. It’s a “10,000 square mile vast-scale simulation, owned by community and run by community,” according to Reid. He’s said it’s his life’s work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cc6b9620-587a-11ec-9ade-3930bbbcd178" alt="MetaWorld splash screen" data-uuid="c6e80f52-b039-3a0e-970a-2f86b36fff96"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld</div></figure><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html">many other organizations</a> at the moment, Reid has been using the buzz around the metaverse to ramp up his own promotional efforts. MetaWorld has a slick website, a fresh YouTube channel, a new Discord server and Reid hosts daily chats on Clubhouse. He recently launched a marketplace where he&#39;s selling digital parcels of land and property as NFTs.</p><p>In the MetaWorld Discord server, a “press” channel lists articles from Engadget, <em>Alphr</em>, <em>TechRadar</em>, <em>UploadVR</em>, <em>VentureBeat</em>, <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>, <em>Variety</em> and <em>CNBC</em>, and links to a video from <em>New Scientist</em> magazine.</p><p>Early on November 3rd, a user named Wolfssskin entered the MetaWorld press room and started typing.</p><p>“Interesting that you think you can do the same scam again,” Wolf said.</p><p>“What’s interesting is that you think that you can stalk and harass me,” Reid wrote back. The confrontation continued with Reid accusing Wolf of being a troll, and Wolf claiming MetaWorld was a scam. The exchange has since been deleted, and Wolfssskin banned from the server.</p><p>However, Wolf is active on another Discord server — this one also called MetaWorld and also created by Reid, though he hasn’t posted in it since 2019. The old server is full of angry users who say they gave Reid their money between 2016 and 2018 to join MetaWorld, and believe they were scammed.</p><p>Reid’s final message in the old MetaWorld Discord server was posted on September 6th, 2019: “Check updates on the updates channel in coming weeks … I&#39;ll also be around with mods for discussion all week.” No update ever came, and in the two years since, the old server has become a guide to the seven stages of grief.</p><p>“It&#39;s disgusting to think that they have just left paying customers with not even a response,” a user named LordGirthVader wrote in June 2020.</p><p>“Yeah but that’s the thing,” another user named Floogey responded, “We weren’t actually customers, we were victims.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="fa242dd79b434aeba249af74c51cf2e2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/125f30a0-587c-11ec-bfbe-11285c659391" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>Engadget first interacted with Reid in 2016, when a UK startup named Improbable arranged a meeting inside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-03-hello-vr-metaworld-improbable.html">a MetaWorld prototype</a> to demonstrate Spatial OS, the startup’s scalable server tech. Reid was one of several developers to make use of the company’s public SDK, and Improbable thought MetaWorld made an effective demo to promote its “open community platform.”</p><p>Shortly after the launch of that prototype, Improbable stopped promoting or mentioning MetaWorld at all. By 2017, questions were being raised about Reid’s ability to deliver on his ambitious promises, which included a custom avatar system, a living world as large as the state of Maryland, a virtual economy, rich environmental simulations and cross-platform capabilities for a variety of VR headsets.</p><p>Reid started <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/metaworld-the-vr-mmo-simulation--2#/">an Indiegogo campaign</a> in April 2017, a move that prompted his former business partner and MetaWorld prototype developer, Carelton DiLeo, to publicly distance himself from the project. DiLeo noted that he was “not currently working on MetaWorld” and didn’t know how Reid planned “to deliver on the promise of the fund.”</p><p>The Indiegogo campaign was not a success, eventually raising $3,674 of a $50,000 flexible goal, meaning Reid got to keep all of the money pledged. This was followed by a new revenue-driving initiative: land speculation. In September 2017, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/metaworld-wants-buy-virtual-land-real-money-not-clear/">Road to VR</a><em>&nbsp;</em>noted that Reid was selling virtual land for real money, and detailed the many questions surrounding the project. Land was available to buy in three tiers, ranging from $15 for a quarter acre to $100 for two acres, though it was unclear what exactly players would do with this property, how the economy would function or how people who didn’t buy land would join the game.</p><p>MetaWorld was listed on Steam as an Early Access title in mid-2017, advertising consistent updates and transparent, community-driven development. There was no actual game to play, no virtual world to explore, but Reid was selling land in MetaWorld regardless. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/?appids=511100&amp;appgroupname=MetaWorld+-+The+VR+MMO+Simulation&amp;feed=steam_community_announcements">September 28th, 2017</a>, a blog post in the MetaWorld Steam community claimed land titles were being sent out to investors, supported by a cryptocurrency Reid had created called MetaCoin.</p><p>In its September 2017 article, <em>Road to VR</em> concluded, “MetaWorld is headed into Early Access, which partly excuses it from being an incomplete product, but the inconsistency in messaging around the game’s core mechanics and features ought to leave you worried about the stability of the still unreleased MMO.”</p><p>By early 2018, Reid claimed he had been investing in crypto for several years to form the economy of MetaWorld, using the cash from early land sales to build the MetaCoin fund. He said he wasn’t personally making any money in the process, and all of the money coming into MetaWorld was being converted into cryptocurrency and kept in a single place called the Metabank, where it was reserved specifically for this new virtual economy.</p><figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/574ccc9e44607bcd495dbce67a3b8292/204148197/metaworld.jpg" data-uuid="f48103b0-bddd-3b2a-b111-63f228c74fb6"><figcaption>The 2016 MetaWorld prototype Engadget experienced.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld</div></figure><p>Reid told Engadget in 2018, “We&#39;re a community-funded entity. So we&#39;ve been working on that, in fact taking on cash and kind of forming it into cryptocurrency, and building an economy.” He said he was using “robo-trading, a couple different investment tools to grow the money.”</p><p>Roughly a year after saying that, Reid left his final message in the original MetaWorld Discord and disappeared from the server.</p><p>A few weeks after Reid’s quiet exit, a user named Immortal posted in the lobby, “Been a while since I’ve heard anything on this game and even longer since my money was happily taken for it. Anyone know anything about this release or is this just one of those things that never happen?”</p><p>“I don’t expect anything to happen,” a user called Myrothas replied. “Asked for a refund a year ago and many times. All I heard was: send me a mail. I did do that multiple times and never received an answer. Quite the red flag for me.”</p><p>Myrothas, real name Johannes Fischer, shared with Engadget a 2018 email exchange where he requested a refund through the MetaWorld help channel. “Backed this project about a year ago and expected it to come out already,” he wrote in the email. “I’d like to ask for a refund.” He says he never received his money.</p><p>Engadget interviewed Reid twice in 2018. In these interviews, Reid explained how paying customers would build MetaWorld themselves, and how cryptocurrency would make the whole thing work as a decentralized, libertarian dreamscape. With players responsible for funding and developing MetaWorld themselves, it was difficult to pin down what exactly Reid was selling.</p><p>One year after the launch of his crowdfunding campaign, Reid said he had “a design worked out in Unity” for MetaWorld, and he planned to transfer this into the existing Spatial OS ecosystem — even though Improbable, Spatial OS’ parent company, wasn’t actively supporting the project any longer. He claimed he’d built a procedural terrain generator for VR and also a robust avatar system with “head tracking, eyes, eye blinking, eye gazing, lip sync, upper torso support,” though these features weren&#39;t ever demonstrated.</p><p>Most of Reid’s goals never materialized. The MetaWorld release date was pushed back again and again, until eventually the Steam page simply read, “Soon.” Reid showed off high-fidelity environments on YouTube and Discord, and then later revealed MetaWorld would be a Google Blocks project, making those assets impossible. MetaWorld never went live.</p><p>“We had a lot of broken promises right off the bat, that was a pretty major flag,” one early adopter told Engadget under the condition of anonymity. We’ll call them Morgan. “And the community was very quick to do some snooping.”</p><p>Engadget spoke with 11 original MetaWorld investors, including people who were deeply involved in the community and often interacted with Reid directly. Many of these members asked not to be named, considering Reid had their personal information and they didn’t trust him to not misuse it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8dabb460-58e8-11ec-9b7b-5e7b442ca566" alt="MetaWorld Discord" data-uuid="0bf3f0ac-d353-364b-82c8-26919808217e"><figcaption>Users commiserating on the original Discord server in 2020.

As people would ask for refunds in the original Discord server, Reid would call them trolls and delete their messages.</p><p>At the time, as calls for refunds were flooding the MetaWorld community, Reid told Engadget he was “in the process of coming up with a better refund policy” and he wanted to honor these requests, but it was difficult to do so without seriously affecting development. Not that Reid planned on doing much development himself — as he described it, he was a designer, the guy with the vision. According to his plan, the community would do the actual coding and game-making, after buying their way into MetaWorld.</p><p>“It was around then that we learned that users would also be responsible for creating assets,” Morgan said. “Assets included anything from buildings to animals… but we&#39;d also be responsible for creating jobs, and performing said jobs to earn currency on the blockchain.”</p><p>Besides that, Reid told Engadget he planned to piggyback off the work happening at multibillion-dollar companies like Facebook, IBM and Google. He pointed out that these organizations had already built VR worlds, avatar systems and AI frameworks, and he said he’d simply use these to create MetaWorld. He seemed unconcerned with the concepts of intellectual property and trade secrets.</p><p>“From my perspective, all code is done and written,” Reid said. A few minutes on, he continued, “The code that drives the artificial intelligence — Watson, or just name your AI code — it exists, right? So I can play with concepts, whereas code&#39;s already written, right? You know what I mean? I can take from any code set I want. And I think by understanding code — I also write code. But rather than get heads down on writing code, I sort of enjoy dreaming up concepts and just understanding how things are put together.”</p><p>In the end, Reid was basically selling an early-concept <em>Roblox</em>, in VR and for adults. But first, he was asking players to build the game itself and pay him for the privilege. After all, he said, actually making MetaWorld was the easy part.</p><p>“This stuff is like, it isn&#39;t rocket science,” he said. “It&#39;s really pretty straightforward to throw a couple objects around and create a couple simulations, a couple VR simulations and put them together. That&#39;s not the hard part, like, making some VR games.”</p><p>That rudimentary 2016 demo, built before developer DiLeo left the team, is the only public proof that Reid’s MetaWorld has ever existed as an inhabitable virtual place. DiLeo went on to build his own simulated environment using Spatial OS, and he <a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/10/somnium-space-announces-acqusition-of-community-garden/">sold it in October 2018</a> to Somnium Space, which is an established, decentralized VR platform powered by blockchain. As part of that deal, Somnium Space offered a refund and land-exchange program for angry MetaWorld customers, in an effort to rebuild trust in VR development as a whole.</p><p>In October 2021, two years after Reid’s final message in the old Discord, a new MetaWorld server appeared. It had a fresh logo, links to his Clubhouse group, and the same pitch as before. A “passports” channel linked to a page where people could pay $10, $20 or $30 for “exclusive community access,” the opportunity to build MetaWorld, and early bidding on future NFT drops.</p><p>At the time of publishing, MetaWorld NFTs have raised 5,126 MATIC (around $11,000) since their launch on November 25th.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/455c9980-58ee-11ec-bff8-f36f0d951a86" alt="MetaWorld NFT sampling" data-uuid="b52b6915-6f54-3028-b326-a465aaf714c9"><figcaption>Listings for MetaWorld NFTs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld/Niftykit</div></figure><p>Reid is now selling virtual land and properties as NFTs on the Polygon network, and people are buying. Land tends to run from $50 to $600, payable in Polygon’s MATIC currency, while a “Piano House” costs $650 and seems to be available via cash payment only. The MetaWorld website claims just 10 of these houses will be minted and simulated.</p><p>“So much excitement, creative thoughts and passion for the future,” Discord user Clare Bratina wrote in the new MetaWorld server on November 25th. “Definitely backing the creators and looking forward to learning how to create in the metaverse and on metaworld.”</p><p>Every now and then in the new server, a random member will spam the channels with warnings claiming that MetaWorld is a scam, and Reid will deny it and delete the messages. Just like old times.</p><p>There is one new, unexpected feature of the revamped MetaWorld campaign: Reid, who happens to be Black, is targeting people of color.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7424ea2c4dab4653a5e6cfdf8bfc3dbc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/41f97820-587c-11ec-9fe4-54a925240967" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>“So happy this exists!” a user called NiKole wrote in MetaWorld’s “town-square” channel on September 5th.</p><p>In October, a member named PixelPil0t posted, “Happy to join your Metaworld! Excited to see what you build Dedric, your background is incredible.”</p><p>Over the past few months, Reid has been doing much of his MetaWorld marketing on Clubhouse, where he has 1,800 followers and regularly joins talks with the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMetaverse">Black Metaverse</a> community, which is run by NiKole. Here’s how Reid closed out <a href="https://twitter.com/dedricreid/status/1456662553866637316">a Clubhouse chat</a> for Black Women in Blockchain on November 5th, after spending a few minutes selling MetaWorld as a Hawaii-sized VR landscape where players would be able to fly airplanes and play around in a persistent, living environment:</p><p>“Much of the inspiration for the world is gearing it towards POC first. You know I&#39;ve been in, sort of, the games and media industry for quite some time. And, you know, as a community we&#39;re often left behind. It&#39;s, you know, the computational world isn&#39;t exactly ‘us’ first, sort of, you know, we&#39;ve been an afterthought. So now we are. So check out the identity system. Look forward to seeing Black faces in the MetaWorld. Peace. My name is Dedric.”</p><p>New users have been trickling into the new MetaWorld Discord server and Reid has been organizing its channels, most of which are empty. It’s mostly newcomers, but there are also a handful of folks from the old MetaWorld server floating around, tracking the similarities between the previous project and the new promises.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6d37c6d0-58f0-11ec-bddc-038b4939fa4c" alt="MetaWorld Creators Channel Log" data-uuid="b88db2df-10a8-3df6-8910-1dab1556d39e"><figcaption>The &quot;creators&quot; channel showed off MetaWorld&#39;s photogrammetery.

This user found the original images on a website unassociated with MetaWorld or Reid, and Engadget eventually traced all the images in channel back to an <em>80 Level</em> interview with <a href="https://80.lv/articles/how-does-mawi-united-create-natural-assets/?amp_markup=1">environmental artist Willi Hammes</a> of MAWI United.</p><p>Engadget spoke with Reid in November, when the creators channel was still live, and asked him what photogrammetry software he was using to build MetaWorld.</p><p>“I&#39;m not actually sure,” he said. “I&#39;m not working on the photogrammetry stuff. So I&#39;d have to ask somebody from my team what they&#39;re using to capture it.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d7869700-58f0-11ec-bef7-b6cfdab325a6" alt="Creators channel asset appropriation evidence" data-uuid="97f5c00d-b79e-33b1-b979-5bc625b60f5f"><figcaption>Original backer BenG found the original versions of many MetaWorld-related assets.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Discord</div></figure><p>Reid said he had a few freelancers working on the project, but he presented himself as the sole full-time creator of MetaWorld. Minutes after our interview, the creators channel disappeared from the Discord server, taking all the photogrammetry claims with it.</p><p>Other MetaWorld assets vanished around this time, too. Reid deleted and unlisted at least two YouTube videos after facing questions about their origins. One of them, called “Generative + Procedural Design Redwood Creek,” was a minute-long speedrun through the Unreal Engine 4 development process, showing the creation of a lush forest scene. It was published on October 31st. The MetaWorld logo was prominently displayed over the entire video, it started and ended with the URL for the MetaWorld website, and its description read, “Using a combination of procedural / generative Design and hand freehand design to construct MetaWorld Redwood Creek region.”</p><p>After establishing we were talking about the same video, I asked Reid point-blank, “So that video, that was you in MetaWorld making something?”</p><p>He was silent for seven seconds. “The video’s MetaWorld, yes,” he finally said.</p><p>However, the footage in question was originally posted to YouTube by a user named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSlfV-DaURg">Nitrogen in March 2019</a>, without any of the MetaWorld bits. The MetaWorld version was edited down and cropped in places, but it was the same video. Reid did not make it, nor was it an example of anything he had built in MetaWorld.</p><p>I brought this information to Reid’s attention.</p><p>“Are you talking about promo videos?” he asked. I responded that I meant the videos on the MetaWorld website and YouTube channel, which we’d been discussing for a few minutes.</p><p>“Oh cool promo videos, yeah yeah yeah,” he said. “Right on, yeah, you’re talking about the promo videos.”</p><p>I clarified, “This one’s called, ‘Generative plus Procedural design Redwood Creek.’”</p><p>“Yeah, we&#39;re showing the power of Unreal Engine,” Reid said.</p><p>“So that’s not you?” I asked. “That’s not MetaWorld?”</p><p>“We’re showing the power of Unreal in our videos on YouTube,” Reid responded.</p><p>I then questioned Reid about a second video published on the MetaWorld YouTube channel on October 31st, this one called “Designing MetaWorld.” It was just five seconds long and showed a windswept valley, long grass blowing in the digital breeze. In reality, this upload was a snippet from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvcBBa3X4js&amp;t=10s">a longer video by Joe Garth</a>, posted in June and with more than 1 million views.</p><p>Reid repeated the argument that these videos were examples of the tools that would be used to build MetaWorld.</p><p>“As an industry we’ve been using these tools, this is a pretty common toolset that much of the industry has had access to — is there something different when we do it?” Reid said. “So I hear that a lot, ‘I hope this isn’t an asset flip.’ Well, no, we’re showing you what’s possible and we’re using the same pipelines and assets that everybody else is using. I find that interesting, that when we use assets, it’s a problem. But Joe Schmo white dude uses assets, nobody says anything. I feel like there’s a double standard.

On November 16th, the<a href="https://www.themetaworld.org/land/esselen-redwoods"> MetaWorld website was updated</a> with new assets and a fresh video called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZLWLkHgVDc">Esselen Redwoods</a>,” which was branded with Reid’s white-and-blue MetaWorld logo. It appears this walkthrough was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPHf71VCWsY">originally uploaded by Simon Barle</a>, an environment artist at DICE, back in 2015, as “Redwood Forest UE4.” The accompanying assets seem to be taken from Barle’s original work as well.</p><p>Reid is using these lifted images to sell land as NFTs on the official MetaWorld website and in cryptocurrency marketplaces. He’s advertising two different environments, Esselen Creek and Esselen Islands, and apparently using misappropriated assets for both. The Esselen Creek images seem to be Barle’s, while a new video titled “MW Esselen Creek Promo 1 1” appears to be a chopped-up version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR7atuOfCVI">this 2017 upload by MAWI United</a>. The MetaWorld version is emblazoned with Reid’s MetaWorld logo alongside the words, “World’s First Simulated Environment NFT.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3277baf0-5878-11ec-add5-029b65bb3784" alt="Side-by-side comparison of two YouTube videos" data-uuid="80c11c60-441a-34df-9296-86298fd8a074"><figcaption>A MetaWorld promo comprised of footage from environment asset company MAWI United.</figcaption></figure><p>The Esselen Islands images look like cropped and mirrored versions of<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/island-landscape-b"> Island Landscape - B</a>, a content pack uploaded to the Unreal marketplace by user Gokhan Karadayi in January 2019. The Islands NFTs aren’t live for purchasing yet, but the presale page collects name, email and crypto-ownership details from interested users.</p><p>Meanwhile, the “Piano House” <a href="https://www.themetaworld.org/marketplace/p/piano-house01">that Reid listed for $650</a> is actually the historic Farnsworth House, and it’s being advertised with an image taken from <a href="https://cgbandit.com/3dmodels/iconic-house-3d-stsena-ekster-yer-i-inter-yer-21490#content-img-3">Russian site CGBandit</a>, uploaded by user chel0ve4ek before February 2021. The original image comes from a ready-to-render scene pack containing Photoshop files based on the Farnsworth House, including foliage, furniture and high-quality textures that Reid definitely did not make himself.<a href="https://www.themetaworld.org/pianohouse11"></a>Another page for the Piano House NFT, which has since been removed, showed 3D renders of an entirely different property, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/799390/piano-house-line-architects">LINE Architects’ Piano House</a>.</p><p>Reid has a clear <em>modus operandi</em> when it comes to advertising MetaWorld: find other people’s images and videos of impressive Unreal Engine environments, edit out the original watermarks, and present them as his own. Meanwhile, Reid has never provided any evidence that MetaWorld has ever looked like any of these assets.</p><p>This entire land-acquisition model dates back to the 2003 game <em>Second Life</em> and has recently been popularized in NFT form by Decentraland and similar platforms, with Decentraland’s virtual economy valued in billions of dollars. When it comes to the Esselen NFTs, the issue is that as far as we can tell, the MetaWorld Reid’s been promising has never existed at all.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a97db9d0-5880-11ec-af5e-fa17bfd80960" alt="MetaWorld assets" data-uuid="c8293557-47e3-310c-a70d-6167244ac486"><figcaption>The Esselen Islands landscape is seemingly taken from the Unreal Engine marketplace.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>In that Clubhouse monologue on November 5th, Reid claimed MetaWorld was already live, and had been for a few years.</p><p>“The other unique aspect of this world is the sheer size of it,” he said. “It exists in the cloud. We pushed it to cloud a couple years ago, and it&#39;s been kind of living and breathing on its own. There&#39;s sort of an AI operating system, if you will, kind of a world-operating system that manages the world and generates the land.”</p><p>This differs from the messaging Reid provided in interviews with Engadget. Reid had difficulty answering standard questions about the revamped MetaWorld, including how the project was being funded, what he’d actually built, where it was hosted, how he planned to sustain this massive world, and how many players he had.</p><p>After saying he was “not sure” how many players were active in MetaWorld, I asked, “Like dozens of people, hundreds of people?”</p><p>“So, I don’t know,” Reid said, before talking for a few minutes about the scope of the project, repeatedly calling it a “moonshot” for his main company, HelloVR. HelloVR seems to exist mainly as a LinkedIn page, with Reid and “Meta Bot” as the only two employees. Reid is listed as CEO. Reid in our interviews has said he works alone with contractors but also recently claimed to have a “partner.”</p><p>When confronted with the misleading nature of his assets or the discrepancies in his pitch, Reid responded with a singular argument: This was just another example of racism in the technology industry.</p><p>“It’s YouTube — am I missing something?” Reid said. “Is YouTube not a place to share videos? So again, there’s an issue when we share videos, but the nature of YouTube is to share videos, everyone else gets a pass?”</p><p>Reid isn’t wrong that the technology sector is dominated by heterosexual, cisgender, white men, and the industry has only recently begun recognizing and reckoning with this imbalance. That’s one of the reasons I was initially excited to interview Reid all those years ago; he was a Black developer in VR and his project sounded amazing. Only once I started asking questions, a lot of Reid’s ideas didn’t add up. And now he’s back with the same approach, but he’s specifically targeting people of color, which he knows is an underserved community.</p><p>“It doesn&#39;t sit right with me that he&#39;s selling this as being a ‘Black-owned’ project,” Morgan said. “I have this terrible feeling that he&#39;s using that to try and protect himself from backlash, because anyone who would go to attack him there could be labeled as racist.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="d3fe0a940fda4b7f9f7e03fc81d772bc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1a28b400-58db-11ec-b6ff-88797b4999e5" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>On Clubhouse and Discord, Reid regularly presents himself as a hyper-intelligent tech entrepreneur with ideas guaranteed to change the world. In interviews with Engadget, however, he acts confused by basic concepts like YouTube uploads, copyright and IP theft.</p><p>“If they come across as disingenuous, oops!” Reid said about his YouTube history. “Like, all right, but that wasn’t the intent, we can sort of learn from that. The last thing we want to do is like, piss a bunch of people off.”</p><p>The original MetaWorld server is filled with people who could be accurately described as “pissed off.” Many of them bought land the first time around and ended up requesting refunds, citing Reid’s inconsistent messaging and lack of results over a period of years.</p><p>One investor who asked to remain anonymous, called Kris here, said they joined MetaWorld in 2018 because they loved VR and wanted to support small, innovative developers. Kris spent at least $60 on virtual land and defended Reid in the original Discord server until the day he disappeared.</p><p>“The vision of sharing an open world with people who want to build something big catches me every time,” Kris said. “It would be so great if a game comes that includes what MetaWorld promised. ...We planned a whole city, we were very deep into this and really hoped that we could someday visit ... but after a while a lot of people asked for refunds, day after day, with no response from Dedric. After he wrote that last message there wasn’t a Dedric anymore, and all hope was gone.”</p><p>Another investor who asked for anonymity, whom we’ll call Ryan, joined MetaWorld as an escape from their real-world anxieties. Ryan is disabled, and saved for a VR headset before discovering MetaWorld in 2018.</p><p>“I was looking desperately to find something to just change the boredom of life,” Ryan told Engadget. “My life sucks. I&#39;ve got a heart failure complicated with a bunch of other stuff right now, and I just can&#39;t get out and do things in the real world.”</p><p>Ryan shared receipts of all of their purchases with Engadget, alongside chat logs with Reid and an account called “Metabot,” which was controlled by Reid at least part of the time. Both reassured Ryan over the course of several months that all was well with MetaWorld.</p><p>“At first, even though I was concerned, I was still hoping that the project would happen,” Ryan said. “I tried to be patient.”</p><p>In total, Ryan spent almost $300 on passports, land, property and virtual currency. They never directly asked for a refund from Reid. By the time Ryan thought to do so, they saw multiple people had tried and failed to get their money back, and it didn’t seem worth the stress.</p><p>“I felt like I had been scammed, and was embarrassed,” Ryan said. “Due to the nature of a scam, I didn’t feel that there was a point. I was not getting answers in DMs … so I just gave up.” Ryan later heard from another community member about Somnium’s refund offer, and recouped his money from that company.</p><p>“Dedric and his group, I don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible, mostly it bothered me a lot because they took advantage of me,” Ryan said. They continued, “They apparently don’t care for anybody except themselves … I lost a little faith at that time.”</p><p>These days, Ryan said they only use their VR headset for <em>Beat Saber</em> exercise, but they’ve found some friends and community in the MMO <em>Dual Universe</em>.</p><p>In a five-hour Discord call with the MetaWorld community in September 2018 (yes, <em>five hours</em>), Reid dodged probing questions from investors and made more bold claims. For one, he said MetaWorld was on track to launch in beta at the end of the summer, which was just three days away. A few callers chuckled and made snide comments at this goal, clearly in disbelief.</p><p>“Yeah, we&#39;re pushing for it to start next week,” Reid responded. “What&#39;s so funny about that?”</p><p>MetaWorld did not go live at the end of that summer. Of all the investors we spoke with, none of them received a refund from Reid.</p><p>As it stands in 2021, Reid still doesn’t seem to understand why anyone from the original round would want their money back, and he remains confused by the definition of “a refund.” This is years after Somnium Space facilitated refunds to some angry MetaWorld backers.</p><p>“This narrative of like, there&#39;s been anything disingenuous, is like nonsense, right?” Reid told Engadget this year. “It doesn&#39;t make any sense. Like, that doesn&#39;t necessarily fit into, as a leader of the project, my narrative, right? So like, yeah, so there&#39;s a lot of confusion around like, what a refund is. But like, the whole concept of refund was created by the folks over at Somnium.”</p><p>For early investors like Fischer, Kris, Ryan and Morgan, Reid’s stream-of-consciousness, nonsense-tinged responses are all-too familiar.</p><p>“I’m still mad about the whole thing, that one guy can do a scam on the web without consequences, it looks like he doesn’t even care,” Kris said. “Just think about some kids pumping their money in there for nothing, just an old man doing scams. That’s pretty sad.”</p><p>Reid is currently pitching the vague idea of MetaWorld on Clubhouse, Discord, Twitter and YouTube, and he said people are buying in (though exactly how many, he’s not sure). His NFT marketplace full of misappropriated assets is live, and so far, he’s raised more than $11,000. It&#39;s impossible to know how much Reid made from the initial backers, but at its height the first MetaWorld Discord had around 2,000 users, according to an ex-moderator we spoke with.</p><p>A Trello board linked on the new MetaWorld site serves as a roadmap for development and NFT drops, and current goals include a “land client” due February 14th, 2022, and “social simulation testing” due March 2022, complete with “Spatial OS Unreal Engine 5 support pending.”</p><p>Improbable, the company that runs SpatialOS, has no idea what Reid means by this claim. In a statement to Engadget, Marine Boulot, Improbable’s VP of PR and Communications, said, “Improbable has never had a commercial relationship with HelloVR/MetaWorld … neither HelloVR nor MetaWorld have any right or licence to use SpatialOS beyond any legacy prototyping kits they might have had access to years ago.”</p><p>Put simply, Reid does not have access to SpatialOS to build the game as he’s selling it.</p><p>It doesn’t end there: The quotes attributed to Engadget on the MetaWorld website and Reid&#39;s Clubhouse profile are fiction. One of them is credited to a writer that&#39;s never worked for Engadget.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5787d6d0-5879-11ec-bbbe-3f1fa0bc4e47" alt="MetaWorld quotes" data-uuid="cf09acb5-b696-39d4-aa0b-01b4250ab1aa"><figcaption>Misattributed quotes on the MetaWorld website and Reid&#39;s Clubhouse profile.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The original MetaWorld Discord server is still active — more active than the new, official one, even — and it’s filled with folks looking for closure and a way to warn potential investors about the lies they say they’ve encountered in Reid’s universe. Reid never shut down that server, saying he was hacked and lost access to the email account associated with it years ago, and adding that Discord had ignored his request for assistance.</p><p>A former member provided proof that Reid had access to his MetaWorld email account in April 2020, seven months after he last posted in the Discord server. At this point, that’s barely a surprise.</p><p>“He promised us this special, unique world where anything was possible,” Morgan said. “That we could build out our dreams in this place with no limits… and then just took our money and lashed out when we asked for updates or help. We were promised villages and towns with our own governance, that we could have full control over our collectives. I was really looking forward to making that persistent safe space where anyone was welcome.”</p><p>That seems to be exactly what the people in the new MetaWorld server want, too.</p><p>“Im not going anywhere,” a user called KBOT wrote on November 7th. “I support @dedricreid and @themetaworld completely!”</p><p>Meanwhile, in the old MetaWorld server on November 8th, user Kuma posted, “Please please please. Everyone with real evidence, expose him. He’s gaining loads of traction.”</p><p>For now, it’s a tale of two servers, with a vast digital paradise hanging in the balance — or not, depending on which channel you’re in.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor, and Nick Summers, who was a Senior Reporter at Engadget until early 2021.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metaworld-nft-metaverse-dedric-reid-clubhouse-discord-170052007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8ca6a6f-a177-4cae-988e-f32dc67f4efb</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639154607</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T16:43:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/99b33170-5848-11ec-befc-49d83b88b040" width="2560" height="1310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/99b33170-5848-11ec-befc-49d83b88b040" width="2560" height="1310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metaverse NFT art]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metaverse NFT art]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Retro online gaming service Piepacker adds five Atari classics to catalog]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://piepacker.com/index.html#root">Piepacker</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/piepacker/status/1468943802136154120?s=20">added five Atari titles</a> to its catalog of retro games.

They have a new &quot;contoured&quot; form factor with a tapered silhouette that&#39;s more comfortable and fits better, and they&#39;re now sweat and water resistant like the Pro model.

The Korean company has given its 65-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2021-oled-tv-pricing-c1-g1-a1-151137971.html">LG OLED Evo TV</a> a makeover, made it part of its Object Collection and gave it a cover that you can move up or down using a dedicated remote control.</p><p>If you&#39;re not watching anything and just want to use the TV as a clock or to play music — the device&#39;s speaker has an 80-watt output — you can roll down the cover halfway and only show a part of the screen. That said, you can choose from the themes LG provides if you want the whole display to be visible. Since it&#39;s meant to invoke the look of an art piece, the model is mounted on a metal easel and can simply be leaned against a wall instead of hanged. Even its moving cover resembles canvas, since it uses fabric, particularly fabric by Danish premium textile brand Kvadrat.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The LG OLED Evo TV Object Collection costs a lot more than its ordinary OLED Evo counterpart, as you probably already expected. It will be available starting on the 15th in Korea for US$8,381 and will have three Kvadrat cover colors to choose from: beige, redwood and green.

The likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-16-bose-700-headphones-review.html">Bose</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">Sony</a> have damn near perfected the craft while the rest of the pack attempts to usurp them. Yamaha is the latest to throw rocks at the throne by adding a collection of 3D sound options of its latest headphones with active noise cancellation (ANC). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-anc-headphones-130036800.html">YH-L700A</a> has unique qualities, but $499.95 is a high price for Yamaha’s latest blend of design and features.</p><p>Yamaha created a unique aesthetic for the YH-L700A. Opting for square earcups over the typical oval shape. They’re immediately striking – for better or worse. But, the combination of leather, fabric, matte black plastic and silver accents create a refined look. The company also decided to attach the headband at the front of the earcups rather than at the center. This doesn’t make a massive difference in terms of comfort, but it does mean the headband sits further forward on the top of your head. Earcups swivel flat and fold in for easy storage, which makes the YH-L700A a decent option for travel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are no touch controls here,Yamaha chose to go with physical buttons instead. On the back edge of the right earcup are power and 3D Sound Field buttons, with the former doubling as the Bluetooth pairing control and the latter allowing you to cycle through presets. On the outside of the right earcup, a small leather-covered panel holds buttons for volume, track controls, play/pause and activating a voice assistant. Those last two options are in the middle (single and double press, respectively) while the two outside arrow buttons adjust volume with a single press or skip tracks with a press and hold. Unfortunately these are difficult to find; they&#39;re not embossed deep enough to feel them easily. Over on the left, there’s a single button on the back edge for noise cancelling mode. A single press cycles between ANC, ambient sound and off.</p><p></p><p>The main attraction on the YH-L700A is Yamaha’s 3D Sound Field feature, complete with head tracking. Basically, the company has developed a collection of seven audio presets for music and movies or shows: cinema, drama, music video, concert hall, outdoor live, audio room and background music. Each one “transforms stereo sound into three-dimensional listening,” according to Yamaha, adjusting the parameters for each virtual environment in an effort to make things sound more immersive. Another aspect of this setup is dynamic head tracking, which gives the illusion of the audio coming from a stationary point in space when you move. It’s a bit weird for music, in my opinion, but it does add something to more cinematic viewing sessions.</p><p>It’s obvious that 3D Sound Field significantly tweaks the audio on every preset. However, all of the filters are very heavy handed, drastically changing the EQ and other parameters to the point that none of them work well across genres. Outdoor live, for example, accurately creates the feeling of being at a festival, with the heavy bass and  subdued vocals you’d experience in real life. It’s okay for things like metal and rock, but for softer more acoustic styles it’s not great. If you listen to a wide range of music you’ll need to change presets when you venture to a new genre. Oddly enough, the cinema preset is the best all-around setting for tunes. Almost all of the music presets are loaded with reverb, which works for something like the concert hall preset, but it becomes exhausting elsewhere. All of the options recreate their stated venue, it’s just that none of them are really pleasant to listen to for an entire album’s worth of tunes.</p><p>When it comes to movies and television, the cinema and drama options are quite nice. There’s no content that highlights this prowess better than Netflix’s <em>Formula 1: Drive to Survive. </em>With a mix of spoken interviews, auto racing and dramatic overtures, there’s a lot for headphones and speakers to handle. The YH-L700A does well with the dimensional sound that’s typically best served by a Dolby Atmos setup in your living room. Everything sounds spacious, and the directional roar of the cars comes through nicely.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7bf84b020643449488273f0f70967e51" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b70f41b0-5932-11ec-bff7-2988a99816e9" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A review"></section><p>Without 3D Sound Field, the YH-L700A is an average sounding set of noise cancelling headphones. There’s good clarity and detail, but the mid-range can be overbearing when you’re listening to a full band. There’s decent, punchy bass but a shot of treble would go a long way here to round out the sound and cut through the chaos of songs like Underoath’s “Damn Excuses.” At times, the lack of highs creates an unpleasant muddy mess. Even with more acoustic genres like bluegrass, upright bass dominates with the other strings taking a backseat. That’s the case throughout much of Sturgill Simpson’s <em>The Ballad of Dood &amp; Juanita</em>. It’s obvious Yamaha was intent on making its 3D audio feature sound good, it’s too bad the “regular” listening experience is mediocre at best.</p><p>The YH-L700A packs active noise cancellation, complete with an ambient sound mode that allows you to tune into your surroundings as needed. Like Apple and others, Yamaha outfitted its ANC setup with tech that can adjust the audio to changes in wear. The so-called Listening Optimizer takes measurements every 20 seconds to pick up any variances in seal and air leakage. The headphones can then adjust the sound to account for any issues. While I don’t have any way to measure how effective this is, I <em>can </em>tell you that overall, the ANC gets the job done. It’s not as powerful as the likes of Bose or Sony, but most of the time it’s good enough.</p><p>Lastly, there’s a Listening Care feature that attempts to maintain decent sound quality even when you listen at lower volumes. Typically, and to the detriment of our collective hearing health, headphones sound the best at medium high to high volumes. With the YHL700A, Yamaha says Listening Care analyzes sound to keep a full range at low volume. It accounts for changes in background noise during the process, to offer the best possible audio no matter how loud. And while it’s not as consistent as the company would have you believe, rock tunes maintain a decent frequency range well below 50 percent volume. You do lose some detail, as expected, but it’s still perfectly listenable at those levels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/59d9d381-5931-11ec-b9fd-d2d2af5897f8" alt="Yamaha attempted to cater to both cinephiles and music nerds with a range of attractive features. Battery life with those tools enabled is disappointing for a set of $500 headphones and the presets can be heavy handed. As it stands, Yamaha has a solid set of headphones in need of some fine tuning." data-uuid="7f71a068-d262-38c8-b2ef-e095ec4b8fba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The marquee features can be enabled or disabled from Yamaha’s headphones app. There are options for 3D Sound Field, head tracking, Listening Care, Listening Optimizer and noise cancellation. You can also select your preferred 3D preset from your phone as well as adjust (or disable) the auto power-off timer. The software displays your battery percentage too, so you’re not left wondering what the “battery level high” voice prompt means when you power up the headphones.</p><p>Battery life is a major sticking point with these headphones. During my initial tests, I managed just ten and half hours with both ANC and 3D sound enabled and head tracking off. That’s 30 minutes shy of the company’s 11-hour projection. Sure, that’s a lot of tech at work simultaneously, but most flagship noise-cancelling headphones are pushing 30 or more hours of use on a charge. Yamaha says this is possible if you disable the Sound Field tech, extending the expected battery life to 34 hours. The range with the YH-L700A at full strength should be at least 15 hours to justify the asking price. The company released a firmware update ostensibly to improve battery life during the course of my review, but the results didn’t change with ANC and 3D sound both active.</p><p>In terms of the movie- and 3D-focused competition, a few options come to mind. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">Apple’s AirPods Max</a> feature dynamic head tracking and support spatial audio through Dolby Atmos and Atmos Music. It doesn’t have a selection of presets to help you fine-tune things ready at the press of a button, but there is an adaptive EQ that maintains sound quality as conditions and external noises change. AirPods Max also offers the most natural sounding transparency mode out of any headphones I’ve tested. However, they’re still $479, although we’ve seen them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airpods-deals-black-friday-2021-134723984.html">as low as $429</a> recently.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/59d9fa91-5931-11ec-babf-a21da4e5c583" alt="Yamaha attempted to cater to both cinephiles and music nerds with a range of attractive features.

The company’s flagship model is packed with handy features like pausing when you speak, quick attention mode and the ability to automatically adjust noise cancelling settings based on activity or location. The 1000XM4 equally impresses in the sound and ANC departments, including support for 360 Reality Audio via supported streaming services, making them our top overall choice for headphones right now. They don’t pack in dynamic head tracking, but they will save you significant money at the current going rate of $248 (full price: $350).</p><p>Yamaha has crafted an interesting proposition with its YH-L700A headphones. The company attempted to equally cater to both cinephiles and music nerds with features that work for both movies and television alongside options for casual listening. Battery life with the most attractive tools enabled is disappointing for a set of $500 headphones and the presets would benefit from some restraint. A fully customizable EQ and a slight bump in the battery department would go a long way to justifying the high price here, but for now, Yamaha has a solid set of headphones in need of some fine tuning.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-review-130056716.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9bac010-0744-4a90-afd4-aa1c9ce104bb</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 13:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639142985</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T13:29:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Sonic The Hedgehog 2' trailer gives us a first look at Knuckles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> turned out to be one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-sonic-the-hedgehog-live-action-movie-review.html">biggest movies</a> of 2020, despite serious CG character issues that caused a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-delayed-design.html">three-month delay</a>.

There are also franchise-specific channels for <em>Survivor, The Challenge</em> and, oh boy, <em>PAW Patrol</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck, parents.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-live-channels-star-trek-survivor-spongebob-squarepants-163257829.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><h3></h3><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-vs-snapchat-spectacles-173247974.html"><br></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-novi-money-transfers-us-124027874.html"><ins>WhatsApp begins offering Novi money transfers to some users in the US</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sharks-robot-vacuum-with-ai-navigation-is-30-percent-off-today-at-amazon-140021143.html"><ins>Engadget Deals: Shark&#39;s robot vacuum with AI navigation is 30 percent off at Amazon</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-music-mode-profile-anthem-134330964.html"><ins>Tinder&#39;s &#39;Music Mode&#39; is like a mixtape from potential dates</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-worlds-now-available-us-canada-192520479.html"><ins>Meta&#39;s Horizon Worlds opens up to adults in the US and Canada</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fan-website-tudum-interviews-videos-behind-the-scenes-201153389.html"><ins>Netflix created an info hub for its original shows and movies</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-escape-2021-interactive-livestream-bts-doja-cat-muselk-mark-rober-195034506.html"><ins>YouTube&#39;s Rewind replacement is a livestream event called Escape2021</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhl-22-women-national-hockey-teams-iihf-174026969.html"><ins>&#39;NHL 22&#39; will add women&#39;s hockey teams for the first time</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html"><ins>Ford stops F-150 Lightning reservations at 200,000</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/space-x-launches-nasa-ixpe-060812924.html"><ins>SpaceX launches a NASA telescope to observe black holes</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/italy-fines-amazon-for-abuse-of-dominant-position-085244332-085736675.html"><ins>Italian regulator fines Amazon $1.28 billion for abusing its market dominance</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-cowboy-bebop-canceled-000159745.html"><ins>Netflix&#39;s live-action Cowboy Bebop is over after one disappointing season</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-alan-wake-2-is-coming-in-2023-121529653.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04adc15d-56a6-43d4-b872-ed9a2977f37e</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 12:15:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639135982</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T11:33:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/75f19210-5959-11ec-b3bc-99d575e94b7c" width="2160" height="1352" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/75f19210-5959-11ec-b3bc-99d575e94b7c" width="2160" height="1352" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alan Wake 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK High Court rules that Julian Assange can be extradited to the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A UK appeals court has reversed a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/julian-assange-court-ruling-110440821.html">previous ruling </a>that Wikileaks founder shouldn&#39;t be extradited to the US due to mental health concerns, the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-united-states-london-espionage-extradition-87c7f8f5acf747bbddb7cb87005fded6"><em>Associated Press</em></a> has reported. The decision opens the door for Assange to be extradited to the US, where he&#39;d face charges of espionage over Wikileaks&#39; publication of government documents.&nbsp;</p><p>Lower court Judge Vanessa Baraitser originally ruled that the US criminal justice system presented a risk to Assange&#39;s physical wellbeing. &quot;The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man, who is genuinely fearful about his future,&quot; the judge ruled in January. &quot;For all of these reasons I find that Mr. Assange’s risk of committing suicide, if an extradition order were to be made, to be substantial.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its appeal, however, the US government argued that Assange had no history of &quot;serious and enduring mental illness&quot; that would suggest any risk of self-harm. US lawyers also told British judges that if they extradited Assange, he could serve his US prison sentence in his home country of Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>The High Court in London decided that those assurances were enough to guarantee Assange would be treated humanely. The final decision for his extradition is now in the hands of the UK home secretary, though Assange has the option of appealing.

The maximum penalty is 175 years in prison, though US lawyers said &quot;the longest sentence ever imposed for this offense is 63 months.&quot; Assange was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/06/julian-assange-refused-bail-despite-judge-ruling-against-extradition-to-us">denied bail</a> for risk of flight and is being held at London’s high-security Belmarsh Prison.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-appeal-court-rules-that-julian-assange-can-be-extradited-to-the-us-113923762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afc1d758-eced-4617-b8e7-80c3f500f71e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 11:39:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639136499</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T11:41:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[UK International News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/0c8279c0-5c4f-11e9-b9bf-b53c06bfad6e" width="2191" height="1510" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/0c8279c0-5c4f-11e9-b9bf-b53c06bfad6e" width="2191" height="1510" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peter Nicholls / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange makes a speech from the balcony of the Ecuadorian Embassy, in central London, Britain February 5, 2016.

Apple revised its guidelines last year so that companies like Microsoft and Google can make their games available on iOS. That said, they can only do so by releasing each game as an app that users can download. Microsoft previously said that forcing users to download hundreds of game apps is &quot;a bad experience,&quot; but it would&#39;ve reportedly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas">done so</a> if Apple had agreed to its proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>According to private emails seen by<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826297/microsoft-xbox-xcloud-streaming-exclusives-iphone-ipad-gamepas"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Xbox head of business development Lori Wright laid out a proposal for Apple, which would allow Microsoft to put individual game apps on the iOS store without taking up all of a user&#39;s storage space. Wright asked Apple to allow Microsoft to put its streaming tech inside the Gaming Pass app alone. That would give the company a way to make the game apps themselves around 30 MB in size instead of the 150 MB that they would be if its streaming tech was incorporated into each of them.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead of using the device&#39;s processing power, the games would stream out of remote servers powered by Xbox One and Xbox Series X processors. Wright also apparently offered to make Xbox-exclusives available for iOS users in an effort to convince Apple. &quot;This would be an incredibly exciting opportunity for iOS users to get access to these exclusive AAA titles in addition to the Game Pass games,&quot; she wrote in an email.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft told <em>The Verge</em> that Apple rejected its solution and wanted the company to incorporate its streaming tech into every game application. As for Apple, it told the publication that Microsoft&#39;s proposal didn&#39;t adhere to its App Store Review Guidelines, &quot;specifically the requirement to use in-app purchase to unlock additional features or functionality within an app.&quot; Microsoft denied that in-app purchases factored into Apple&#39;s rejection.</p><p>In the end, Microsoft eventually shifted its development focus and gave iOS users access to xCloud <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-could-gaming-ios-web-215045999.html">via Safari</a>. Xbox Cloud Gaming CVP Kareem Choudhry told <em>The Verge,</em> however, that the company &quot;will continue to look for viable resolutions that [will] allow [its games] into the App Store.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-games-ios-app-store-105431324.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4bc51635-0a0a-4674-b442-e14e92d07ed1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 10:54:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639133725</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T10:55:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35a416d0-5998-11ec-894f-be160bddcbe1" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35a416d0-5998-11ec-894f-be160bddcbe1" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV 4K 2021 falls to an all-time low of $150 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite big improvements, particularly with the Siri remote, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2021 Apple TV 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3oGgmjW">2021 Apple TV 4K</a> is still a pretty expensive set-top streaming device at $179.

The A12 Bionic processor delivers performance that&#39;s faster than ever, and it supports Dolby Atmos sound, 60 fps Dolby Vision, AirPlay 3 and screen mirroring. With HomeKit support, you can also ask Siri to do things like show you video feeds or open your smart lock.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest improvement over the last model is the redesigned Siri remote. It&#39;s larger and less fiddly to use, but also touch sensitive so you can easily swipe between options.

Scarlett was one of the lead organizers of the #AppleToo movement and aired fellow employees&#39; and workers&#39; grievances against the company on their behalf. She also filed a complaint against Apple with the National Labor Relations Board for allegedly suppressing workers&#39; organizing efforts and interfering with surveys involving gender pay equity. The former Apple engineer was supposed to withdraw her complaint as part of the settlement when she left. Now, though, she told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple/"><em>Forbes</em></a> that she&#39;s no longer withdrawing her complaint because of the way Apple chose to execute the terms it agreed to.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the terms of their settlement, Scarlett would receive a one-year severance package if she withdraws her complaint with the NLRB. Apple also agreed to publicly acknowledge workers&#39; rights to talk about their salaries and workplace conditions. &quot;One of the requests I made was for there to be a very public, visible affirmation that employees are allowed to discuss their workplace conditions and compensation, both internally and externally,&quot; she told <em>Forbes</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Apple did acknowledge workers&#39; rights to discuss pay, the company only posted its stance on its internal human resources page. Also, it allegedly made the post on November 19th, the weekend before employees&#39; Thanksgiving vacation, when people may not be paying attention to anything work-related. The company also took the post down by Monday after the holidays when employees have only just started coming back to work.</p><p>In addition, Scarlett said Apple refused to make the 22 changes in the settlement document that the NLRB had requested. One of those changes involve a part in the settlement that asks Scarlett not to &quot;solicit, encourage or incite anyone to file any charge or complaint with any administrative agency or Court against Apple&quot; for a year after the settlement is executed. Apparently, the NLRB requested for the words &quot;encourage or incite&quot; to be removed from the paragraph. Scarlett says that kind of language would prevent her from helping Apple employees organize or file complaints against the company.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, Scarlett has reportedly only received less than half of the settlement she was promised, and she&#39;d likely no longer get the rest now that she isn&#39;t withdrawing her labor board complaint anymore. Apple is also facing another NLRB complaint filed by former senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik who was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fires-ashley-gjovik-025858158.html">fired</a> in September. Gjøvik previously said that she was put on indefinite paid administrative leave after raising concerns about sexism in the workplace, as well as dealing with an unsafe and hostile work environment.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/appletoo-organizer-cher-scarlett-no-longer-withdraw-labor-board-complaint-062929530.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52551ce9-2a7f-4d15-88ed-fd8ddeb9f2a1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 06:29:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639116156</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T06:02:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikada via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Hong Kong, China - October 20, 2011: People in the Apple Store at International Finance Center, Central Hong Kong, opened on the September 24, 2011.

Dramatic Labs said <em>Resurgence</em> will also feature appearances from “returning” characters.
