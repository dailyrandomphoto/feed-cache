No? Samsung has a solution for you regardless. As <em>Techspot</em> reports, Samsung Australia and Dr Denim have <a href="https://news.samsung.com/au/samsung-and-dr-denim-say-goodbye-to-large-pockets-with-z-flip-pocket-denim-jeans">unveiled</a> a pair of limited edition blue jeans, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Z Flip Pocket Denim" href="https://fave.co/2YcsJtA">Z Flip Pocket Denim</a>, that ditches the usual pockets (they&#39;re stitched shut with a big &quot;Z&quot;) in favor of one designed to hold a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>. It&#39;s really a promo for the foldable phone, but Samsung insists this minimalism could be the &quot;next big trend.&quot; That conspicuous blank space on your thighs helps &quot;frame the legs,&quot; if you believe the marketing spin.</p><p>Only 450 pairs are available, but they come in men&#39;s and women&#39;s styles. You also won&#39;t be paying much of a premium, either. Pay AUD $1,499 (about $1,112 US) and you&#39;ll get both the Flip 3 and the jeans to match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether or not you find the jeans chic or gauche... they&#39;re probably not the wisest investment. Never mind that you&#39;re buying jeans that are only intended to hold one phone — what happens if you need keys or a wallet in your front pocket? We&#39;d add that the pocket you do get leaves your phone partially exposed, which screams &quot;steal my phone&quot; in a way no ordinary pocket would. If you&#39;re really determined to leave your mark on the fashion world, you&#39;re probably better off buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-bespoke-edition-140040550.html">Flip 3 Bespoke Edition</a> and flashing it around whenever you make a phone call.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-jeans-170421250.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a85427f-44a2-42fc-b8c9-83dbe5a1c49e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 17:04:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635959637</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T17:13:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aca9bd90-3cc2-11ec-9fef-65128c04f719" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aca9bd90-3cc2-11ec-9fef-65128c04f719" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pierre Toussaint/Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Z Flip Pocket Denim jeans with Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Z Flip Pocket Denim jeans with Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Indiegogo will review crowdfunding campaigns before they launch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/indiegogo/"><ins>Indiegogo</ins></a> has announced some big changes for its crowdfunding platform. The biggest move is that it&#39;s transitioning from an open platform to a closed one, with the goal of eventually vetting every campaign before it goes live. <a href="https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2021/11/10-years-1-takeaway-community-trust.html"><ins>In a blog post</ins></a>, Indiegogo&#39;s vice president of product and customer trust Will Haines noted that when the company started in 2008, the idea was to let anyone raise money for just about any purpose with few restrictions.</p><p>&quot;However, I’ve learned that &#39;open&#39; is not what our community wants,&quot; Haines wrote. &quot;Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap in the dark. And it certainly can’t be scamming. Our community of backers is the reason that anything happens on Indiegogo, and they are counting on the platform to be a safe, trusted space to engage with innovation.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, Indiegogo will scrutinize projects more closely before those seeking funding can push their campaigns live. Under what the company is calling <a href="https://entrepreneur.indiegogo.com/the-guidepost-program/">The Guidepost Program</a>, Indiegogo will do more to ensure that projects have a viable plan to follow through and fulfill their rewards.</p><p>Haines stressed that Indiegogo can&#39;t guarantee every campaign will deliver on its promises, but it &quot;can protect backers from unfeasible projects and outright scams. We now have the resources and expertise to apply this level of scrutiny to all of our largest campaigns and will expand it to every campaign moving forward.&quot;</p><p>Indiegogo has expanded its trust and safety team to help it screen campaigns, and it formed a review board to oversee the riskiest campaigns and the &quot;most impactful&quot; decisions made by the trust team. In addition, the company has teamed up with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gofundme/">GoFundMe</a> to create the <a href="https://entrepreneur.indiegogo.com/crowdfunding-trust-alliance/">Crowdfunding Trust Alliance</a>. The group&#39;s goal is to share best practices and discuss industry trends, and it aims to enlist other reputable crowdfunding platforms.</p><p>One feature that&#39;s on the way to Indiegogo is the Trust Loyalty Program. This will highlight campaigns from creators who have run successful projects in the past. Haines wrote that Indiegogo will &quot;tailor our vetting to match the historical risk level of these entrepreneurs.&quot;</p><p>There have been many crowdfunding-related scams and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-29-ftc-investigates-700000-crowdfunding-campaign.html"><ins>allegations</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-06-ftc-lawsuit-ibackpack-fraud-indiegogo-kickstarter-crowdfunding.html"><ins>of fraud</ins></a> over the years, as well as campaigns for products that don&#39;t seem to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-30-arubixs-indiegogo-hoax.html"><ins>pass the smell test</ins></a>. It&#39;s likely a net positive that Indiegogo is getting more serious about screening campaigns, even if some legitimate projects might fall through the cracks. In any case, it&#39;s still wise to exercise caution whenever you consider contributing to a campaign, since there&#39;s always going to be at least <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-07-indiegogo-requires-campaigns-disclose-product-status-risk.html">a little risk</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/indiegogo-closed-platform-crowdfunding-campaign-screen-165238148.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0c6eeb75-c386-4a07-8f1f-f2aa4bb3f7a8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635958362</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T16:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/f267f5e0-ad80-11ea-b5d7-547e496ead61" width="5056" height="3414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/f267f5e0-ad80-11ea-b5d7-547e496ead61" width="5056" height="3414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Prostock-Studio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Togetherness concept.

The Chromium-based browser is available either through Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">website</a> (in .deb and .rpm formats) or through the command line using a Linux package manager.</p><p>The Linux version has been a long time in coming. Microsoft was testing the Edge variant in its Dev and Beta channels for about a year, and it&#39;s arriving more than two years after the Mac and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-chromium-edge-browser-release-date.html">Windows versions</a>. It&#39;s not clear what prompted the wait, although Linux has historically had little consumer PC market share.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature parity is largely intact, at least. You unsurprisingly won&#39;t find an Internet Explorer compatibility mode (only Windows has that), but you can sync tabs, bookmarks, passwords and extensions. This may be your browser of choice if you use Linux on a personal system but want the browser setup from your Windows PC at work.</p><p>The release is symbolic of how Microsoft&#39;s relationship with Linux has changed over the years. The company was notoriously antagonistic in the early 2000s, when CEO Steve Ballmer called Linux &quot;a cancer&quot; on intellectual property and otherwise treated it as a threat to Windows. Internet Explorer effectively served as a deterrent to would-be Linux switchers as many IE-optimized sites wouldn&#39;t run properly on Linux browsers without significant effort, if they ran at all.</p><p>Flash forward two decades and it&#39;s a different story. The company is now much more focused on services than Windows, and that means making offerings like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-365-available-worldwide-164731336.html">Microsoft 365</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-365-cloud-virtual-pc-150022333.html">Windows 365</a> as accessible as possible. Microsoft needs to be friendly to Linux users to keep them from using rivals like Google Workspace — Edge for Linux could be worthwhile if it leads to years of subscription fees, even if users have no plans to switch to Windows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-linux-stable-release-161545904.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5a8f443-62a3-4626-bac4-3ece9719d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 16:15:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635955136</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T15:58:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' Vivobook Slate is a 2-in-1 laptop with an OLED display for $600]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/asus/">ASUS</a> is preparing to ship what it claims is the first 13.3-inch Windows 2-in-1 laptop with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oled/"><ins>OLED</ins></a> screen.

In fact, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-preview-e3-130020326.html"><em>Metroid Dread is the first all-new game</em></a> in the series since the divisive <em>Metroid:</em><em>Other M </em>arrived in 2010. As the fifth mainline, side-scrolling game in the series, <em>Dread</em> has a lot to live up to. And while it’s not a total reinvention of the franchise, like <em>Metroid Prime</em> was 19 years ago, it also does a great job of avoiding the pitfall of feeling like a retread, an issue that occasionally plagues Nintendo’s other flagship franchises.</p><p>If you’ve played any of the previous side-scrolling Metroid games, <em>Dread </em>will be familiar. As usual, Samus Aran loses all her powers and needs to escape an underworld maze, fighting baddies and retrieving power-ups that let you explore new sections (or old parts of the map you couldn’t get through before).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11701b3fccf940bc96696126b644aa5c"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>That’s a well-trodden path, but Nintendo flipped things this time with the E.M.M.I. encounters, terrifying robotic enemies that stalk you through specific parts of the map. They can’t be killed until you explore their area to find a weapon power-up that puts you on equal footing. At first, I was worried that these encounters would be too frequent, or too hard to escape, but developer MercurySteam did an excellent job balancing out the E.M.M.I. areas. Escaping from the dreaded robots by leaving the zones they patrol isn’t too tough, and you don’t have to spend <em>so </em>long in their areas that the whole game devolves into stealth tension.</p><p>On the other hand, if you get caught by an E.M.M.I., that’s pretty much it. You have one chance to block their lethal attack, and I’ve only done it right once. I’ve probably gotten caught several dozen times and have never made it out alive. Fortunately, the game just resets you to the door entering the E.M.M.I. zone if you fail, so you won’t lose much progress.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4e594c0-3cb3-11ec-bf2b-54560b27f0f5" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Metroid Dread" data-uuid="114d91d1-6953-35fb-b3c0-98cd07601d3e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, I’ve had a blast exploring the dank tunnels and caverns that make up the world of <em>Dread. </em>As with most Nintendo games, the atmosphere and art style are top-notch, even if <em>Dread</em> doesn’t hold a candle to the more technologically advanced titles on the Xbox Series X or PS5. When I play a game that is this well-designed and thoughtful about what it does with the technology available to it, I don’t worry about counting pixels. That said, it also looks extremely impressive docked to my 4K TV.</p><p>Most of the gameplay hallmarks of Metroid titles are here, including power-ups like charged shots, the morph ball, the missile cannon and plenty of other returning favorites. But there’s enough new here, like the grapple beam and screw attack, to keep the game feeling fresh.</p><p>Maybe for people who have obsessively played the Metroid series before, <em>Dread </em>will feel like more of a retread. But while I’m familiar with the core components of these games, the first-person <em>Metroid Prime</em> is the game I know the best — I never beat the original game, or the highly-regarded <em>Super Metroid</em> on the Super NES. If you’re like me, don’t let that stop you from trying <em>Metroid Dread</em>. There’s a reason so-called Metroidvania games are still popular.&nbsp;</p><p>And if you haven’t tried one before, getting the newest installment in the series that helped define the genre is a great way to get your feet wet. Most importantly, it doesn’t feel like MercurySteam and Nintendo just checked the boxes for this game. Indeed, the skill that MercurySteam brought to <em>Samus Returns</em> (a remake of 1991’s <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus</em> for the Game Boy) is on display here; Nintendo definitely picked the right developer to make the first mainline Metroid game since 2002. It’s an inspired addition to a series that already has an impressive legacy. Just don’t get cocky — run like hell if an E.M.M.I. tracks you down.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-is-a-nintendo-essential-151014629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5479586-5147-44de-8b89-c6b8f31f0a61</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 15:10:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635951570</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T14:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9e3bf780-3cb5-11ec-b8db-0c85ec70153b" width="2500" height="1517" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9e3bf780-3cb5-11ec-b8db-0c85ec70153b" width="2500" height="1517" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/edddd960-3cb1-11ec-9efd-cd7cb1062cde" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[3]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US bans trade with security firm NSO Group over Pegasus spyware (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Surveillance software developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html">NSO Group</a> may have a very tough road ahead. The US Commerce Department has added NSO to its Entity List, effectively banning trade with the firm. The move bars American companies from doing business with NSO unless they receive explicit permission. That&#39;s unlikely, too, when the rule doesn&#39;t allow license exceptions for exports and the US will default to rejecting reviews.</p><p>NSO and fellow Israeli company Candiru (also on the Entity List) face accusations of enabling hostile spying by authoritarian governments. They&#39;ve allegedly supplied spyware like NSO&#39;s Pegasus to &quot;authoritarian governments&quot; that used the tools to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">track activists, journalists</a> and other critics in a bid to crush political dissent. This is part of the Biden-Harris administration&#39;s push to make human rights &quot;the center&quot; of American foreign policy, the Commerce Department said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest round of trade bans also affects Russian company Positive Technologies and Singapore&#39;s Computer Security Initiative Consultancy, bot of which were accused of peddling hacking tools.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked NSO Group for comment, although its official media contact address produced an error. The company has strongly rejected claims of enabling abuses in the past, including denials that Pegasus was used to target murdered journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. NSO said it had blocked access for previous abuses, and it even hired a libel attorney who accused investigative journalists and their partners of misinterpretation and making unfounded assumptions.</p><p>The Commerce Department claims to have evidence of NSO&#39;s actions, though. The net effect is the same. NSO isn&#39;t necessarily doomed. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-expands-huawei-trade-restrictions-140237627.html">blocklist member Huawei</a>, though, it may struggle to operate without access to any American partners it used before.</p><p><strong>Update 11/3 12PM ET:</strong> An NSO Group spokesperson told Engadget the company was &quot;dismayed&quot; by the decision, and claimed its tools helped the US by &quot;preventing terrorism and crime.&quot; NSO said it would call for a reversal of the ban and reiterated claims it had the &quot;world’s most rigorous&quot; human rights and compliance systems. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>NSO Group is dismayed by the decision given that our technologies support US national security interests and policies by preventing terrorism and crime, and thus we will advocate for this decision to be reversed. We look forward to presenting the full information regarding how we have the world’s most rigorous compliance and human rights programs that are based the American values we deeply share, which already resulted in multiple terminations of contacts with government agencies that misused our products.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-trade-ban-nso-group-145347522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">39548dc9-7d6a-42a5-ad95-0722ef36360d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:53:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635955764</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T16:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e15b4080-3caf-11ec-bded-cfe17379e28f" width="8066" height="5378" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e15b4080-3caf-11ec-bded-cfe17379e28f" width="8066" height="5378" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amir Cohen / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man walks past the logo of Israeli cyber firm NSO Group at one of its branches in the Arava Desert, southern Israel July 22, 2021.

They’re interactive, fun, and you get to tell everyone to put away their phones and tablets for a while. But instead of pulling out the same old classics like Monopoly and Scrabble, we recommend giving some new titles a try. Here, we’ve compiled a list of games that you might not have heard of, but will still make excellent gifts this holiday season. Some are perfect for fantasy and video game nerds, while others are likely to be a hit with the whole family.</p><h2>Trails: A Parks Game</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1974f6e0-3cac-11ec-9fef-1ff45120794e" alt="The Trails board game for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="0df4a8ac-9c88-3f2a-af0a-ec889b1c17a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Keymaster Games</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Trails" href="https://goto.target.com/kjMv5M">Trails</a> is a great little board game for anyone who loves hiking or even just the idea of it. In Trails, players hike on picturesque nature paths while gathering resources, taking pictures and encountering wildlife, earning points along the way. Whoever gets the most points wins. The art in this game is beautiful, featuring 11 national park illustrations from the Fifty-Nine Park Print series. Trails makes an especially great game for nature lovers, as a portion of every game sale is donated to the National Park Service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.target.com/kjMv5M" id="9cff7c090e5a456ebabb748ced59e03f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Target;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Trails at Target - $20</a><h2>Sleeping Gods</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/195cdb00-3cac-11ec-bff9-beda6da9189e" alt="The Sleeping Gods board game for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="688c51b5-8013-3404-a000-bbcf30462e97"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget / Red Raven Games</div></figure><p>If your loved one is a fan of open-world video games such as <em>Skyrim</em> or <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sleeping Gods" href="https://amzn.to/3lv6E2n">Sleeping Gods</a> could well be the perfect board game for them.

It all adds up to a chaotic experience that really emulates the insane adrenaline rush of the original video game.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/306hnrA" id="26aeaf18fc55493d87eb1452b82a534d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:The Op;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Cuphead at The Op - $50</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-board-games-133002225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">501282c0-47a0-3908-b50c-58d4da4b8207</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:44:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635950681</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T14:44:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[giftguide20]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[hgg2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[ylifegifts]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[VMHoliday2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[yentgifts]]></category><category><![CDATA[holiday20]]></category><category><![CDATA[boardgames]]></category><category><![CDATA[YouGotThis]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed8567e0-3cab-11ec-9b97-7a0ab3cba883" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed8567e0-3cab-11ec-9b97-7a0ab3cba883" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Buffalo Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A closeup of the cards, pieces and playing board from the Summer Camp board game.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Summer Camp board game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ford electrified a classic F-100 truck to showcase its EV motor kit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Chevy isn&#39;t the only one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-1957-project-x-car-electric-vehicle-180701463.html">electrifying vintage cars</a> to sell you on aftermarket EV motors. Ford has <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/02/all-electric-f-100-eluminator-concept.html">introduced</a> an F-100 Eluminator concept that upgrades the circa-1978 pickup truck with two of the company&#39;s new Eluminator electric crate motor kit. The powerplants, taken from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html">Mustang Mach-E GT</a> Performance Edition, give the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#39;t discuss performance benchmarks or range, but it&#39;s safe to presume you could smoke some sports cars with that kind of power.</p><p>The truck has more customizations beyond the EV motors, including the vertical center-stack touchscreen from the Mach-E. You&#39;ll also see custom aluminum Forgeline wheels, a billet aluminum dash from JJR Fabrication and avocado-tanned leather from MDM Upholstery. This may look like a classic truck, but it&#39;s not appointed like one.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can&#39;t buy this concept, as you might have guessed. Instead, Ford would rather you buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries, controllers and traction inverters. You&#39;d only want to buy the motor right now if you have the resources to complete the rest of the puzzle yourself. This does, however, hint at a future where many beloved combustion engine cars can get a second life through an EV transplant.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a1aab210-3cad-11ec-af5c-53f4f2d5d505" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="F-100 Eluminator concept truck interior" data-uuid="9918c78d-f734-34e7-ad7b-5003be09c21c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ford</div></figure>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9c24160-8b84-4f38-8ce7-c3187763e78a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 14:05:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635947820</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T13:57:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa-powered indoor air quality monitor alerts you to pollution]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon still isn&#39;t done announcing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html">Alexa-powered smart home gadgets</a> this year.

This and a later wave of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-17-waymo-jaguar-i-pace-ev-self-driving-tests.html">Jaguar I-Pace EVs</a> will rely on human drivers to map streets and learn from the environment, and there aren&#39;t any immediate plans to offer driverless rides to passengers.

The British startup has introduced a powerbank for EVs called <a href="https://www.zipcharge.global/">ZipCharge Go</a> at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html">Cop26</a> climate summit. It&#39;s about the size of a suitcase and weighs around 50 pounds — plus, it has wheels and a retractable handle, so users can put it in their trunk and easily take it out when they need to charge.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, the Go can provide up 20 miles of range after being plugged into the car for 30 minutes. A higher capacity version will be able to provide an EV up to 40 miles of range. The device works with any plug-in hybrid or EV with a Type 2 socket, and it can charge that vehicle to its full capacity between 30 minutes to an hour. Charging up the device itself is as easy as plugging it into any socket, and users will be able to control and monitor it through an app, where they can schedule future charges during off-peak hours for cheaper costs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While range anxiety is becoming <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/500640/survey-price-hurdle-ev-adoption/">less of an issue</a> these days, it&#39;s still <a href="https://www.forbes.com/wheels/news/range-anxiety-very-real-jd-power-evs-survey/">keeping</a> those on the fence from making the leap. A company called Gogoro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html">developed</a> hot-swappable battery technology for scooters to address the problem, but batteries in electric cars typically can&#39;t be swapped out. SparkCharge has a portable EV charging system called the <a href="https://www.sparkcharge.io/roadie">Roadie</a>, but it&#39;s not nearly as easy to carry around as the Go.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the ZipCharge Go isn&#39;t available yet. According to <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/545066/zipcharge-go-portable-ev-charger/"><em>InsideEVs</em></a>, the startup plans to release a 4 kWh and an 8 kWh version, as well as to start deliveries in the fourth quarter of 2022. It can be leased for at least £49 (US$67) per month, though it will also be available for purchase to EV owners who don&#39;t mind paying for one and to businesses like hotels that don&#39;t have installed charging facilities. While ZipCharge has yet to reveal a price for it, <a href="https://www.driving.co.uk/news/business/zipcharge-portable-ev-charger-unveiled-cop26/"><em>The Sunday Times Driving</em></a> section says the company aims to sell it for around the same cost as a 7.2kW home charging port installation.</p><div id="b66870179d784637bc1595a917da2a28"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GNrA8PvQwI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zip-charge-go-electric-vehicles-122503445.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8efbc283-d181-4483-a051-bc91dc28abb8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 12:25:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635953670</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T15:34:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/563f1090-3c95-11ec-af6d-a7dd6d4b37fc" width="1440" height="926" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/563f1090-3c95-11ec-af6d-a7dd6d4b37fc" width="1440" height="926" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zipcharge]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zipcharge Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zipcharge Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon one-day sale drops the price of Philips Hue kits and bulbs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Philips Hue lighting products can do some pretty cool things these days, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/philips-hue-lights-spotify-integration-094738525.html">syncing with Spotify</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-14-philips-hue-white-ambiance.html">helping you sleep</a>.

While the service lets users try any game they want with a $10-per-month Pro subscription, it was the first time free users were given the chance to test a game before purchase. Now, according to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/02/google-stadia-adds-more-free-trials-control-for-30-minutes-riders-republic-for-2-hours/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, Stadia is giving free users the opportunity to take two more games for a spin before they have to buy them. One of those games is <em>Control: Ultimate Edition</em>, which recently just came out for the platform.</p><p><em>Ultimate Edition</em> contains the core <em>Control</em> game, along with the expansions that were released for it. Like <em>Hello Engineer</em>, players will be able to test it out for 30 minutes before they have to decide whether to pay $40 for a copy. The other game is Ubisoft&#39;s recently released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-riders-republic-release-date-195412051.html"><em>Riders Republic</em></a>, a massively multiplayer extreme sports game, where teams can battle each other on bikes, skis, snowboards and in flying wingsuits. Players will get the chance to try it out for two hours instead of just 30 minutes, perhaps because half an hour might barely be enough to cover tutorials when there are several extreme sports to choose from. Besides, <em>Riders Republic</em> isn&#39;t cheap and costs $60 to purchase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the addition of these two games, we can probably expect Google to make more titles available for free trial in the future. It could be an effective way to get people who&#39;d rather own the titles they play interested in purchasing from Stadia instead of from other gaming platforms.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-free-trials-control-riders-republic-102537840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80facd8b-7d43-4426-895c-6e25ec416689</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 03 Nov 2021 10:25:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635934766</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T10:19:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47f78210-3c86-11ec-bfff-741576379f38" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47f78210-3c86-11ec-bfff-741576379f38" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple sold a record number of MacBooks last quarter, says Strategy Analytics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple got some of its MacBook sales mojo back last quarter thanks to discounts on the MacBook Air, according to the research firm <a href="https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-Notebook-PC-Demand-Remained-Healthy-in-Q3-2021-Growing-8-Year-on-Year/default.aspx"><em>Strategy Analytics</em></a><em>. </em>The company sold a record 6.5 million MacBooks in Q3 2021, up 10 percent over last year — no doubt contributing to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-q3-2021-earnings-financial-results-205158698.html">blockbuster Mac quarter</a>.

That’s according to a new <a href="https://f4d9b9d3-3d32-4f3a-afa6-49f8bf05279a.usrfiles.com/ugd/f4d9b9_16ccca9c25a04445a69dcd0298fd530d.pdf">report</a> from the <a href="https://www.counterhate.com/toxicten">Center for Countering Digital Hate</a> (CCDH). The organization found that ten publishers are responsible for 69 percent of all interactions with climate change denial content on Facebook. Included in the group, which the CCDH titled “The Toxic Ten,” are <em>Breitbart</em>, <em>Russia Today</em> and <em>Media Research Center</em>, which has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/01/10/how-fossil-fuel-industry-got-media-think-climate-change-was-debatable/">ties to the fossil fuel industry</a>.</p><p>The findings broadly mirror that of another report the CCDH published earlier in the year, which found that as much as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html">73 percent of vaccine misinformation</a> on Facebook can be linked to only 12 individuals dubbed the “disinformation dozen.” That study has been widely cited by US lawmakers who have called on social media platforms to do more to address the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">urgent threat</a>” misinformation represents to public health.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it did with the earlier disinformation dozen report, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Meta</a>, Facebook’s parent company, disputed the methodology the CCDH used to compile its latest study. “The 700,000 interactions this report says were on climate denial represent 0.3 percent of the over 200 million interactions on English public climate change content from Pages and public groups over the same time period,” a spokesperson for the company said. It also pointed to the recently announced expansion of features like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-climate-change-000051729.html">Climate Change Information Center</a> as evidence of its commitment to tackling misinformation on the topic.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/02/facebook-climate-change-misinformation-breitbart/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, Imran Ahmed, the chief executive of the CCDH, said the organization looked at approximately 7,000 articles published between October 2020 and October 2021. He called the sample “robust” and said there was enough data “to derive representative finds of trends.”</p><p>Additionally, the report examined the financial incentives involved in publishing climate change denial content. The CCDH estimates eight of the companies included in the Toxic Ten made $5.3 million in Google ad revenue over the last six months, with $1.7 million going to the search giant. &quot;We recently <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321?hl=en">announced a new policy</a> that explicitly prohibits publishers and YouTube Creators from monetizing content that promotes climate change denial. This policy will go into effect on <a href="https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9336650?hl=en">November 8</a> and our enforcement will be as targeted as removing ads from individual pages with violating content,&quot; a spokesperson for Google told Engadget.</p><p>“When you put it all together, you’ve got these two industries, Big Oil and Big Tech, and they are the two industries that pose the greatest threat to the survival of our species,” Ahmed told <em>The Post</em>.</p><p>The timing of The Toxic Ten report comes as delegates from around the world meet at the UN’s COP26 climate summit in Scotland in what’s been described as “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-government-and-politics-china-climate-environment-and-nature-01317e4c6f5630f29024753209b48aef">the world’s last best chance</a>” to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Without dramatic reductions, the planet is currently on track for a “catastrophic” 2.7 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures. With every additional degree of warming beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-major-un-report-climate-change-worse.html">1.5-degree target</a> put forward by the Paris Agreement, there’s a greater risk of the planet passing specific tipping points that could lead to even more dramatic changes to the climate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/climate-change-denial-report-ccdh-205333083.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da9a489c-6a25-4dd1-9ba9-c4951bcaf89b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 20:53:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635886763</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T20:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ea2d9b80-3c15-11ec-b9f7-4763ab09fc55" width="3907" height="2605" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ea2d9b80-3c15-11ec-b9f7-4763ab09fc55" width="3907" height="2605" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. President Joe Biden puts on headphones to listen to speeches during "Action on Forests and Land-Use" event at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 2, 2021.

Amazon now has this versatile Chrome OS laptop at the best price we&#39;ve seen — only $300. That&#39;s $130 off its normal price and an all-time low.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wcZ2W2" id="f335e64448da4c46a7c67e6c52bee178" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $300</a><p>The model on sale runs on a 10th-generation Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. While the latter two are pretty common in entry- to mid-level Chromebooks, the Core i3 processor will help this laptop feel zippier than others. While we initially weren&#39;t thrilled by the 4GB of RAM, we found that the Flex 5 Chromebook was more than capable of running multiple tabs simultaneously. As for storage, 64GB should be enough for most people who do most of their work in the Chrome browser anyway. Even at its normal price, the Flex 5 Chromebook provides a lot of power compared to other similarly priced devices — but at $300, it&#39;s a fantastic value.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most Chrome OS machines in this price range tend to sacrifice on style, and while Lenovo&#39;s laptop isn&#39;t ugly by any means, it&#39;s not the slickest either. It weights about three pounds and measures 0.66-inches thick, but it does have a handy convertible design so you could use it as a tablet or even in tent mode to watch TV shows and movies. It has a decent 1080p touchscreen, too, along with a decent array of ports that includes two USB-C ports and a USB-A port. Lenovo did a good job of combining most key features of a good Chromebook into this laptop, which is why we continue to recommend it both when it&#39;s on sale or at regular price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-is-on-sale-for-300-right-now-183046713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8185a6c0-1029-47d2-8d7f-a117aa6157a9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 18:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635876489</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T18:08:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81be5090-bae2-11ea-9fff-2a17206d93cc" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
