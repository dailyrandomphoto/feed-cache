To start, you’ll find a new version of the Snipping Tool that borrows a handful of features from Microsoft’s Snip &amp; Sketch app. Press the “Win,” “Shift” and “S” keys on your keyboard simultaneously to activate the software and then select the part of your screen you want to capture. Once you’ve snapped a screenshot, you’ll find various tools that allow you to edit and annotate the image. With Windows 11, the Snipping Tool also finally includes a dark mode, and you can set it independent of your system theme.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9bff1710-fb9f-11eb-a997-e56059b630a5" style="height:1001;width:1800;" alt="Windows 11 Snipping Tool" data-uuid="03426793-b5e4-3171-9294-b91fd95a923d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft is also updating the Mail and Calendar apps in Windows 11.

Among them: a new technology that can scan the photos on users’ devices in order to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Though the change was widely praised by some lawmakers and child safety advocates, it prompted immediate pushback from many security and privacy experts, who say the update amounts to Apple walking back its commitment to putting user privacy above all else.</p><p>Apple has disputed that characterization, saying that its approach balances both privacy and the need to do more to protect children by preventing some of the most abhorrent content from spreading more widely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>What did Apple announce?</strong></h2><p>Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">three separate updates</a>, all of which fall under the umbrella of “child safety.” The most significant — and the one that’s gotten the bulk of the attention — is a feature that will scan iCloud Photos for known CSAM. The feature, which is built into iCloud Photos, compares a user’s photos against a database of previously identified material. If a certain number of those images is detected, it triggers a review process. If the images are verified by human reviewers, Apple will suspend that iCloud account and report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</p><p>Apple also previewed new “communication safety” features for the Messages app. That update enables the Messages app to detect when sexually explicit photos are sent or received by children. Importantly, this feature is only available for children who are part of a family account, and it’s up to parents to opt in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d4ff9d40-fb96-11eb-9eef-a4cc2fb18968" style="height:567;width:1030;" alt="Apple&#39;s new Messages feature for children will send warnings when sexually explicit images are sent or received. " data-uuid="4b2162e0-2b79-3ef5-9430-3a26a1a69efa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If parents do opt into the feature, they will be alerted if a child under the age of 13 views one of these photos. For children older than 13, the Messages app will show a warning upon receiving an explicit image, but won’t alert their parents. Though the feature is part of the Messages app, and separate from the CSAM detection, Apple has noted that the feature could still play a role in stopping child exploitation, as it could disrupt predatory messages.</p><p>Finally, Apple is updating Siri and its search capabilities so that it can “intervene” in queries about CSAM. If someone asks how to report abuse material, for example, Siri will provide links to resources to do so. If it detects that someone might be searching <em>for</em> CSAM, it will display a warning and surface resources to provide help.</p><h2><strong>When is this happening and can you opt out?</strong></h2><p>The changes will be part of iOS 15, which will roll out later this year. Users can effectively opt out by disabling iCloud Photos (instructions for doing so can be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204570"><ins>here</ins></a>). However, anyone disabling iCloud Photos should keep in mind that it could affect your ability to access photos across multiple devices.</p><h2><strong>So how does this image scanning work?</strong></h2><p>Apple is far from the only company that scans photos to look for CSAM. Apple’s approach to doing so, however, is unique. The CSAM detection relies on a database of known material, maintained by NCMEC and other safety organizations. These images are “hashed” (Apple’s official name for this is NeuralHash) — a process that converts images to a numerical code that allows them to be identified, even if they are modified in some way, such as cropping or making other visual edits. As previously mentioned, CSAM detection only functions if iCloud Photos is enabled. What’s notable about Apple’s approach is that rather than matching the images once they’ve been sent to the cloud — as most cloud platforms do — Apple has moved that process to users’ devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19d14270-fb97-11eb-85f3-29411f6e1ef6" style="height:319;width:671;" alt="Apple&#39;s CSAM hashing system, NeuralHash." data-uuid="24126b46-5516-3a7b-adf1-782bc779a159"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Here’s how it works: Hashes of the known CSAM are stored on the device, and on-device photos are compared to those hashes. The iOS device then generates an encrypted “safety voucher” that’s sent to iCloud along with the image. If a device reaches a certain threshold of CSAM, Apple can decrypt the safety vouchers and conduct a manual review of those images. Apple isn’t saying what the threshold is, but has made clear a single image wouldn’t result in any action.</p><p>Apple also published a detailed technical explanation of the process <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"><ins>here</ins></a>.</p><h2><strong>Why is this so controversial?</strong></h2><p>Privacy advocates and security researchers have raised a number of concerns. One os these is that this feels like a major reversal for Apple, which five years ago refused the FBI’s request to unlock a phone and has put up <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/"><ins>billboards </ins></a>stating “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.” To many, the fact that Apple created a system that can proactively check your images for illegal material and refer them to law enforcement, feels like a betrayal of that promise.</p><p>In a statement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"><ins>called it</ins></a> “a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company’s leadership in privacy and security.” Likewise, Facebook — which has spent years taking heat from Apple over its privacy missteps — has taken issue with the iPhone maker’s approach to CSAM. WhatsApp chief, Will Cathcart, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-head-apple-child-safety-surveillance-system-201956787.html"><ins>described it</ins></a> as “an Apple built and operated surveillance system.”</p><p>More specifically, there are real concerns that once such a system is created, Apple could be pressured — either by law enforcement or governments — to look for other types of material. While CSAM detection is only going to be in the US to start, Apple has suggested it could  eventually expand to other countries and work with other organizations. It’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where Apple could be pressured to start looking for other types of content that’s illegal in some countries. The company’s concessions in China — where Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-chinese-government-control-data-131343119.html"><ins>“ceded control”</ins></a> of its data centers to the Chinese government — are cited as proof that the company isn’t immune to the demands of less-democratic governments.</p><p>There are other questions too. Like whether it&#39;s possible for someone to abuse this process by maliciously getting CSAM onto someone’s device in order to trigger them losing access to their iCloud account. Or whether there could be a false positive, or some other scenario that results in someone being incorrectly flagged by the company’s algorithms.</p><h2><strong>What does Apple say about this?</strong></h2><p>Apple has strongly denied that it’s degrading privacy or walking back its previous commitments. The company published a second document in which it <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><ins>tries to address</ins></a> many of these claims.</p><p>On the issue of false positives, Apple has repeatedly emphasized that it is only comparing users’ photos against a collection of known child exploitation material, so images of, say, your own children won’t trigger a report. Additionally, Apple has said that the odds of a false positive is around one in a trillion when you factor in the fact that a certain number of images must be detected in order to even trigger a review. Crucially, though, Apple is basically saying we just have to take their word on that. As Facebook’s former security chief Alex Stamos and security researcher Matthew Green wrote in a joint <em>New York Times </em>op-ed, Apple hasn’t provided outside researchers with much visibility into how all this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html"><ins>actually works</ins></a>.</p><p>Apple <a href="http://apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"><ins>further</ins></a> says that its manual review, which relies on human reviewers, would be able to detect if CSAM was on a device as the result of some kind of malicious attack.</p><p>When it comes to pressure from governments or law enforcement agencies, the company has basically said that it would refuse to cooperate with such requests. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands,” it writes. “We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it.” Although, once again, we kind of just have to take Apple at its word here.</p><h2><strong>If it’s so controversial, why is Apple doing it?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is because the company thinks this is finding the right balance between increasing child safety and protecting privacy. CSAM is illegal and, in the US, companies are obligated to report it when they find it. As a result, CSAM detection features have been baked into popular services for years. But unlike other companies, Apple hasn’t checked for CSAM in users’ photos, largely due to its stance on privacy. Unsurprisingly, this has been a major source of frustration for child safety organizations and law enforcement.</p><p>To put this in perspective, in 2019 Facebook reported 65 million instances of CSAM on its platform, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/online-child-sexual-abuse.html"><ins>according to </ins></a><em>The New York Times</em>. Google reported 3.5 million photos and videos, while Twitter and Snap reported “more than 100,000,” Apple, on the other hand, reported 3,000 photos.</p><p>That’s not because child predators don’t use Apple services, but because Apple hasn’t been nearly as aggressive as some other platforms in looking for this material, and its privacy features have made it difficult to do so. What’s changed now is that Apple says it’s come up with a technical means of detecting collections of known CSAM in iCloud Photos libraries that still respects users’ privacy. Obviously, there’s a lot of disagreement over the details and whether any kind of detection system can truly be “private.” But Apple has calculated that the tradeoff is worth it. “If you’re storing a collection of CSAM material, yes, this is bad for you,” Apple’s head of privacy <a href="http://nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html"><ins>told</ins></a><em>The New York Times</em>. “But for the rest of you, this is no different.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1d1e05c6-27fe-4bf5-9e29-0ec9d5605925</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 18:30:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628792867</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T18:27:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shubhashish5 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tokyo, Japan - May 23, 2020 : Apple iPhone during iOS update.

The retailer is reportedly leaning toward licensing tools from a company called <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/">BehavioSec</a>.</p><p>&quot;The software does not rely on personally identifiable information or other static data,&quot; a <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/documents/faq/privacy-faq/">FAQ page</a> from BehavioSec states. Instead, the company claims it uses &quot;behavioral biometrics&quot; to generate a profile of how someone types and uses their computer. Its software then utilizes that profile to verify that a hacker or imposter hasn&#39;t compromised an employee&#39;s device. BehavioSec&#39;s website lists Cisco and Deutsche Telekom as &quot;partners,&quot; suggesting Amazon wouldn&#39;t be the first company to use its software. Amazon reportedly looked at other employee monitoring solutions. However, due to &quot;challenges around collecting keystrokes data,&quot; concluded it was best to turn to more &quot;privacy-aware&quot; models like BehavioSec.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the document, Amazon claims it needs such software to combat various security threats. The company points to at least four cases where its security team identified incidents where someone posed as a service agent to obtain customer data. &quot;We have a security gap as we don&#39;t have a reliable mechanism for verifying that users are who they claim they are,&quot; the company states in the document.&nbsp;</p><p>With more of its employees working remotely due to the pandemic, it&#39;s also worried about a higher risk of &quot;data exfiltration.&quot; Amazon points to several hypothetical scenarios it wants to protect itself against, including one where a customer service employee forgets to lock their computer, and a nosy roommate steals the company&#39;s data.

Android developers who used the company&#39;s software development kit (SDK) were given seven days to remove SafeGraph&#39;s location gathering tools from their apps or face possible ejection from the Play Store, as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5db4ad/google-bans-safegraph-former-saudi-intelligence"><em><ins>Motherboard</ins></em></a> reported.</p><p>Some of the data SafeGraph obtained was from apps that harnessed the SDK. The apps were able to track user locations, though many people many not be aware how companies use their data.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google brought the hammer down on SafeGraph in early June. It&#39;s not clear if any apps are still using the SDK or if Google has taken action against developers who haven&#39;t removed SafeGuard&#39;s plug-ins. Engadget has contacted Google for comment.</p><p>With context, it&#39;s possible to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/priest-outed-grindr-app-highlights-rampant-data-tracking-rcna1493"><ins>find out details about individuals</ins></a> using location data, even when it&#39;s supposedly anonymized. Data <em>Motherboard </em>bought from SafeGraph showed the movement of users between points of interest. The company also sells secondary information from other companies to augment the location data, according to the report. Other datasets are said to include the names of people who own property in the US, which could reveal details about individual users.</p><p>SafeGraph reportedly sells its location data to almost anyone willing to pay for it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is said to be among SafeGraph&#39;s customers, while <em>The New York Times </em>used SafeGraph data for a project that showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-us-reopen.html"><ins>where people were gathering</ins></a> after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were loosened. The publication told <em>Motherboard </em>that it aggregated the location data.</p><p>In February, Google took <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8eba/google-predicio-ban-muslim-prayer-app"><ins>a similar action</ins></a> against Predicio, which is linked to a company named Venntel. Public contracts that emerged last year showed that US Customs and Border Protection <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dhs-investigate-audit-cbp-phone-tracking-no-warrant-163107786.html"><ins>bought data from Venntel</ins></a>, reportedly for warrantless phone tracking.

As <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/08/12/2022-polestar-2-price-cut-fwd-features/">reports</a>, the 2022 &quot;entry-level&quot; EV <a href="https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/637040">will start</a> at $45,900 before incentives, or a cool $14,000 below the original dual-motor version&#39;s price. If you&#39;re in California, that cost after incentives could dip to a relatively low $34,900. That&#39;s no mean feat when it offers the longest range of the bunch at an EPA-estimated 265 miles.</p><p>The long-range dual-motor version starts at a lower $49,900 for 2022 ($38,900 after California incentives), with a longer 249-mile range on top of that. The catch, as you might guess, is that you&#39;ll need to add &quot;packs&quot; to get certain creature comforts, regardless of which car you&#39;re buying.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The promised mechanical heat pump, which extends range in chilly conditions, is part of a $4,000 Plus Pack that also includes a full-length glass roof, a &quot;premium&quot; interior (with Harman Kardon audio), vegan seating and cabin illumination. A $3,200 Pilot Pack  adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings and a 360-degree camera. The dual-motor-only $5,000 Performance Pack adds 20-inch alloy wheels with Brembo brakes, sport tires and gold cosmetic touches.</p><p>Deliveries of single-motor Polestar 2 units are expected by the end of 2021, while the updated dual-motor configurations should arrive in October. The pricing still makes the electric fastback more expensive than its most obvious rival, the $39,900 Tesla Model 3 in Standard Range Plus trim. However, it&#39;s now close enough that you might not mind the extra outlay if Polestar&#39;s design is more appealing — and the claimed range is finally competitive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-single-motor-price-range-151503533.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">57af5703-12e3-4fa0-b34c-a047f6bdee23</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:15:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628781203</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T15:13:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Not Tonight 2' tackles capitalism and political greed in an 'alternative' US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years after taking on Brexit in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-29-not-tonight-post-brexit-bouncer-game.html"><em><ins>Not Tonight</ins></em></a>, publisher No More Robots and developer PanicBarn are working on a sequel to the satirical political RPG. <em>Not Tonight 2 </em>takes place in a supposedly alternate version of the US, where &quot;capitalism and political greed have taken center stage and democracy is a thing of the past.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Not Tonight 2 </em>centers around three intertwined stories written by a group of POC artists and authors.

The carrier has <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-customers-get-amc-plus">launched</a> a promo that gives Fios and wireless subscribers up to a year of &#39;free&#39; AMC+ streaming. Not surprisingly, you&#39;ll only get the full 12 months if you spend the most — you&#39;ll have to either sign up for a Mix &amp; Match Fios plan or activate a new line on one of the network&#39;s better unlimited wireless plans (Play More, Do More or Get More) while buying one of the company&#39;s &quot;best&quot; 5G-capable phones.</p><p>Cellular subscribers who either activate a Start Unlimited plan or upgrade to a top-tier 5G phone on an existing line will get a more modest six months of AMC+ service.

We&#39;d add that this comes just a day after Samsung revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">Flip 3</a> — the bonus AMC+ access could serve as an incentive to update your phone.</p><p>The question, as with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-free-stadia-pro-5g-internet-subscribers-130032328.html">other carrier perks</a>, is whether or not this is really adding value. Verizon already gives all its users at least six months of Disney+, Discovery+, Apple Arcade, Google Play Pass and Apple Music — if you aren&#39;t a hardcore <em>Walking Dead</em> fan, what&#39;s another service you&#39;ll try a few times and cancel? There&#39;s also the question of pricing — what if you were comfortable dropping the freebies in return for a lower rate? While networks like Verizon don&#39;t say how much it costs to offer bonuses like this, there&#39;s a mounting concern that the costs could add up.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-amc-plus-bonus-offer-142542376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">26340469-8772-4da6-8d64-c4d4621b5684</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:25:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628777690</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T14:15:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/73c20cc0-fb73-11eb-bfc3-cc7bc3bdef4c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/73c20cc0-fb73-11eb-bfc3-cc7bc3bdef4c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Josh Stringer/AMC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Norman Reedus as Daryl in 'The Walking Dead' season 11]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Norman Reedus as Daryl in 'The Walking Dead' season 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Hades' is coming to Xbox and PlayStation on August 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zagreus might struggle to escape the Underworld, but he&#39;s no longer bound by the confines of PC and Nintendo Switch. <em>Hades</em>, widely regarded as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-2020-163051873.html">one of the best games of 2020</a>, is <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades-xbox-playstation-coming-soon/">coming to</a> Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and PS5 on August 13th.

Headsets have come a long way since the launch of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive five years ago. Standalone devices like the Oculus Quest 2 let you hop into virtual reality anywhere, while also giving you the flexibility of streaming virtual reality from powerful PCs. And if you don&#39;t care about dealing with a wired headset, there are a plethora of high-end options out there. Most importantly, there are plenty of memorable VR experiences like <em>Vader Immortal</em> and <em>Half-LIfe: Alyx </em>that you can&#39;t experience outside of a headset.</p><h2>So what makes a good VR headset?</h2><p>I tend to judge them on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It&#39;s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto them. But it takes skill to craft something that&#39;s well balanced and doesn&#39;t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a low field of view makes it look like you’re looking through a pair of binoculars, which limits the sense of “presence” you can feel in VR. But a wide field of view can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth.</p><p>And when it comes to controllers, the best options fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has practically adopted the design of Oculus&#39;s excellent touch controllers, but we&#39;re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve&#39;s finger tracking gamepads.</p><h2>Best VR headset for most people: Oculus Quest 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9f7c78c0-fa04-11eb-af24-b0871afa1509" alt="Oculus Quest 2 VR headset"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Almost a year since its release, the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4">Oculus Quest 2</a> remains the best VR option for the vast majority of consumers. It&#39;s completely cordless, relatively inexpensive (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:starting at $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">starting at $299</a>) and it&#39;s comfortable to wear for long sessions. There&#39;s also a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it&#39;s bundled with Oculus&#39;s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.</p><p>The Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution 1832x1920 per eye, the highest we&#39;ve seen from Oculus. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2&#39;s field of view isn&#39;t the best — it&#39;s been measured at just around 90 degrees — but it&#39;s still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also <a href="https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/i-boosted-my-quest-2s-field-of-view-halfway-to-a-valve-index-vrcover-foam-pads-fov-rated/">use different face pads</a> to increase its field of view a bit. And if you want an even more comfortable fit, you can snag <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Oculus&#39;s Elite headstrap for $49" href="https://amzn.to/2U5v8UP">Oculus&#39;s Elite headstrap for $49</a> (or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$129 with a built-in battery and case" href="https://amzn.to/3xCtwQi">$129 with a built-in battery and case</a>).</p><p>Facebook has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html#:~:text=Working%20with%20the%20US%20Consumer,with%20its%20latest%20VR%20headset.&amp;text=Facebook%20is%20also%20halting%20sales,to%20every%20Quest%202%20package.">recalled the foam inserts</a> from the original model and is offering silicone covers to make the headset more comfortable. We didn&#39;t experience any issues during our review, or during the past year of usage, but there have been enough complaints for Facebook to take action. The base $299 Quest 2 will also come with 128GB of storage when it returns to store shelves on August 24th. That&#39;s double the storage of the original model, giving you even more room to cram in games and VR apps.</p><p>The Quest 2 may not offer the best overall VR experience, but it&#39;s certainly the most accessible headset on the market.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299</a></p><h2>Best PC VR headset under $600: HP Reverb G2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/221fc520-fa05-11eb-bf1f-39ee1a30d1b7" alt="HP Reverb G2 VR headset"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don&#39;t care about wireless VR, and you want to invest a bit more in a high-quality PC headset, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2" href="https://fave.co/3jmfJs7">HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2</a> is meant for you. It was developed in cooperation with Valve and has some of the best features from the pricier Index headset, like near-field speakers. The Reverb G2 also has sharp screens, offering 2,160 by 2,160 pixels per eye, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a relatively wide 114-degree field of view.</p><p>It&#39;s also the first Windows Mixed Reality headset to include four tracking sensors, which helps to ensure more accurate VR tracking, especially during fast-paced games. I also give HP  credit for making a headset that’s extremely comfortable thanks to its luxurious amount of cushioning around the eye-piece and rear strap.</p><p>The Reverb G2&#39;s motion controllers weren&#39;t my favorite, but they&#39;re still a big step up from HP&#39;s previous model. You could also upgrade it to use Valve&#39;s finger-tracking controllers, but that involves snagging SteamVR sensors and a lot more setup. Still, it&#39;s nice to have the upgrade path available.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Reverb G2 at HP - $599" href="https://fave.co/3jmfJs7">Buy Reverb G2 at HP - $599</a></p><h2>Best PC VR headset for gamers: Valve Index</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/63597680-fa05-11eb-9f9f-91fe11b5cb03" alt="Valve Index VR headset"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://fave.co/377HC11">Valve&#39;s Index kit</a> remains one of the best high-end VR solutions on the market. For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we&#39;ve seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it&#39;s still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I&#39;d gladly lose a few pixels to get a smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond any other consumer headset.</p><p>As a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it&#39;s wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it&#39;s not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you&#39;ll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.</p><p>Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>feel like a dream. It&#39;s unfortunate that other VR games haven&#39;t fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/377HC11">Buy Index at Valve - $999</a></p><h2>Best VR quality, no matter the cost: HTC Vive Pro 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2</a> is the best-looking PC VR I&#39;ve seen. It has an astoundingly sharp 5K screen and a solid 120Hz refresh rate. Just be prepared: the full kit, which includes the headset, two SteamVR sensors and wand controllers, costs $1,399. You can also buy the headset separately for $799 as an upgrade to the original Vive Pro, or the Valve Index.</p><p>For the price you get a well-balanced and supremely comfortable VR headset. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html#:~:text=The%20HTC%20Vive%20Pro%202,make%20it%20a%20tough%20sell.">Pro 2</a> is a clear sign that Valve has practically perfected the art of making high-end hardware. I&#39;m less impressed with the large wand controllers, which are exactly the same as the ones that came with the original HTC Vive in 2016. They&#39;re functional, but they&#39;re nowhere near as ergonomic as Oculus&#39;s Touch Controllers.</p><p>I&#39;m mainly recommending the Pro 2 here based on the astounding quality of the headset.</p><p>True VR fans may want to just grab that separately along with SteamVR base stations and Valve&#39;s finger-tracking controllers.

While it’s still a very comfortable headset, and it does magic with the PS4’s limited power, it’s not the smartest buy today. That’s particularly true when Sony has been eager to chat up its sequel VR headset for the PS5. We know that device will come with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-vr-controllers-121517263.html">more modern controllers</a> and have hardware similar to PC VR headsets.

The company will also double-check before those older teens enable downloads for their videos.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The social media giant will try to promote healthy usage habits, too. Notifications will turn off for teens under 16 starting at 9PM local time, while 16- and 17-year-olds will receive their alerts until 10PM. This will theoretically help teens wind down, not to mention discourage late-night <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-adds-anti-bullying-comment-controls-130007601.html">bullying</a>.</p><p>TikTok stressed that there was &quot;no finish line&quot; for privacy and safety efforts, and that there would be more to come in the months ahead. The focus is clear, however — TikTok doesn&#39;t want stories of teens facing bullies, creeps and other abusers that found them through public videos and unsolicited messages. In theory, the restrictions provide a gentler introduction to TikTok that helps younger audiences understand the consequences of their actions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-limits-teen-access-130931754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98f73a69-b8f7-407b-bc6c-afb6c077724d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:09:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628773774</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T13:09:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LOIC VENANCE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenager presents a smartphone with the logo of Chinese social network Tik Tok, on January 21, 2021 in Nantes, western France.

But today marks the first time that it is launching a<em> flagship</em> phone to the global market as an independent company. Free from the US sanctions that rocked its former parent, Honor is once again able to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-smartphones-google-apps-50-series-huawei-171758485.html">American software</a> (hello, Android 11) and silicon (hello, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Qualcomm</a>). This then, is the start of Honor’s second life, which is beginning with the launch of the Magic3, its first — well, “<em>first</em>” — flagship.</p><p>Historically, Honor was Huawei’s budget play, offering a surprising level of quality and tech for relatively low prices. The Honor 20, for instance, was the sort of phone that made you forget about the need to buy a flagship handset despite its modest sticker. Now, of course, with the freedom (read: obligation) to create high-end handsets, Honor is shuffling its brands. The high end will now be dominated by Magic-branded handsets, while the numbered line (like the Honor 50) will sit in the middle, and the low end now the domain of the X-Series.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design-wise, Honor’s apple did not fall far from Huawei’s tree. From several angles, the Magic3 looks like a Huawei Mate, and this is not the only time I’ll bring this up. Given the sharing of IP and technology between the two companies before the split, this is not a huge surprise. I’m sure that many of the handsets Honor releases over the next couple of years will have that whiff of shared DNA, and like the Mate this phone has a waterfall display, with an 89-degree curve down both sides of the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f235b700-fb64-11eb-bf75-8b98d187afb5" style="height:690;width:1920;" alt="Honor Magic 3" data-uuid="707cdb14-39c4-3ec8-a293-5e196038fb45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honor</div></figure><p>There are three Magic3 handsets in the range, the vanilla Magic3, Magic3 Pro, and the Magic3 Pro+. Every member of this trio is packing a 6.67-inch, 2,272 x 1,344, always-on flexible OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR 10+. There’s a 94.82 screen-to-body ratio, the ideal fact to wheel out when you need to impress folks in bars, too. The cut-out for imaging plays host to a 13-megapixel, f/2.4 wide camera with a 100-degree wide-angle lens no matter what model you opt for. Although the higher end Pro and Pro+ models are the only ones that pair it with a 3D Time of Flight sensor for face unlocking.&nbsp;</p><p>The real interest, however, is in the lenses on the back of the phone, and Honor is throwing all but the dishwasher at this phone. Arranged in a setup the company is calling &quot;The Eye of Muse,&quot; the regular handsets get a 50-megapixel, f/1.9 lens with Sony&#39;s IMX766 image sensor, a 64-megapixel, f/2.2 monochrome camera and a 13-megapixel, 120-degree f/2.2 ultra-wide camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pro, meanwhile, adds a 64-megapixel, f/3.5 OIS telephoto camera with a 3.5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid zoom and 100x digital zoom. The Pro+, meanwhile, swaps out that IMX766 for the larger, f/1.9 1/1.28-inch IMX700 with OIS. You&#39;ll get that 64-megapixel monochrome camera with an f/1.8 aperture, a 64-megapixel 126-degree, f/2.4 ultra-wide camera and that same telephoto lens. (You&#39;ll also get a TOF sensor and color temperature sensor for more accurate imaging.)</p><p>Honor also said that this IMAX-enhanced camera can be used to shoot your own cinema-quality films, a boast previously used to sell Huawei’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-huawei-s-mate-30-pro-has-quad-camera-array-and-a-vegan-leather-o.html">Mate 30</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-mate-40-123031700.html">Mate 40</a> (told you I’d mention this again). Honor says that, unlike those handsets, it has developed a custom, mobile-friendly version of the filming standard Log, dubbed MagicLog, which is designed to shoot high-quality video.</p><p>Broadly speaking, Log is a way of recording footage that preserves as much of the dynamic range and tone as possible. When viewed straight from the camera, the footage looks weird and it requires a lot of post-processing and grading. In order to save ordinary users from that agony, Honor teamed up with professional colorist <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572972/">Bryan McMahan</a> to create eight pre-set grades which work like Instagram filters.</p><div id="0e366ea5ff4b4fdf9d144fb18d5f3f92"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXhl9gTxz9Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Honor said that one minute of MagicLog footage will take up around 500MB of memory, so if you want to shoot a film with one of these, invest in one with lots of storage. And this is a feature that we’d love to test in depth in future, because if this in some crazy way does turn out to work, it could be a very big deal.</p><p>Beyond imaging, Honor wanted to talk up the various software engines that it has designed to help squeeze better performance out of the Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-snapdragon-888-plus-under-screen-camera-133605155.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G SoC found in the Pro and Pro+. (The regular Magic3 is using Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon 888.) Long story short, Honor (and Huawei before it) uses an AI layer which has been trained to monitor for challenging processes and adjust power to compensate. It says that, for the Magic3, you can expect to see faster and more stable 5G and gaming performance when using the phone. Then there is OS Turbo X (Apple’s lawyers, I’m sure, will be taking notes) which, it’s claimed, will be able to keep the system running at peak performance for longer. Honor’s representatives said that this system alone will ensure that, after using it for 36 months, you’ll only experience a 3.8 percent drop in performance compared to the day you bought the phone.</p><p>And then there’s “Smart RAM,” which sounds like the sort of RAM-doubling scamware that we saw back in the days of Windows 3.1. Honor’s representatives said that, in times of need, the Magic3 can bounce some of the data from its RAM to the phone’s flash memory. Now it’s not clear if the company is trying to pass virtual memory off as some sort of new-fangled innovation or if there’s some clever new implementation here. Honor says that, no matter if you have the 8GB or 12GB variant, you can expect this system to offer you an additional 2GB of headroom when required. I have no idea if file transfer speeds between the SoC and flash memory are fast enough to make this a viable, boastworthy feature for a new flagship handset.</p><p>The company has also offered some smart privacy features, like obscuring message notifications when you cast video to a TV, as well as the ability to strip metadata from images before you share them to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Honor hasn’t said how long this device will last on a single charge, but that 4,600mAh battery should have plenty of staying power. All three variants support 66W wired SuperCharge, and you can get up to 50 percent of your battery re-juiced with just 15 minutes of connection. In addition, the Pro and Pro+ models both support 50W wireless charging, should you feel the need.</p><p>Magic3 is available in four colors: Black, White, &quot;Golden Hour&quot; and &quot;Blue Hour,&quot; the latter pair are a pinkish-orangey hue, and a deep royal blue. The standard colors are available in Honor&#39;s usual coating, while the two hours are available in vegan leather. The 3 Pro+, meanwhile, comes in either a ceramic black or white ceramic body with pinstripe texturing which, at first blush, looks extraordinary. All of the handsets are IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, which is about the minimum you can expect from a phone these days.&nbsp;</p><p>The Honor Magic3 series will make its debut in Mainland China, with news about arrivals in western markets coming in short order. CEO George Zhao did, however, reveal pricing for the handset when it reaches Europe, at the very least. The Magic3, with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, will retail for €899 ($1,054), while the Magic 3 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will set you back €1,099 ($1,289). Flagship-lovers, looking to grab the Magic3 Pro+ with 12GB RAM and 512GB Storage, meanwhile, will have to fork over at least €1,499 ($1,758).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic3-flagship-125020517.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">446c057c-8da6-4714-bf65-4cc096235a6b</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:50:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628772623</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T12:50:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor Magic 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor Magic3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard loses three senior designers amid sexual harassment lawsuit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three senior designers pivotal to <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>World of Warcraft </em>are no longer at Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113"><em>Kotaku</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>confirmed the trio of abrupt departures after initially learning about them from internal sources. They include <em>Diablo 4 </em>game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and<em> World of Warcraft </em>designer Jonathan LeCraft. Insiders told the publication that the three developers names had been removed from Blizzard’s internal directory and Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>News of the shakeup arrives as Activision Blizzard is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">grappling</a> with allegations of systemic gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The incendiary accusations, which were revealed in a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), have already led to damaging repercussions for the publisher. Blizzard is facing an internal outcry, with workers staging walkouts and demanding corrective action. Earlier this month, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">lost its president</a> and was hit with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">lawsuit by investors</a> irked by its handling of the crisis. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has admitted that the publisher&#39;s original response to the DFEH filing was &quot;tone-deaf.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company did not give a specific reason for the latest departures, two of the designers (namely McCree and LeCraft) were reportedly pictured in photos of the infamous &quot;Cosby Suite.&quot; This was the hotel room explicitly mentioned in the DFEH lawsuit where male employees allegedly harassed women at company events. As <em>Overwatch </em>fans may know, the game features a cowboy called Jesse McCree named after the now ex-Blizzard employee. It remains to be seen if the publisher changes the character&#39;s name.</p><p>“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,&quot; a spokesperson for Blizzard told <em>Kotaku</em>. &quot;We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253af6cf-2b1b-405c-b456-5af76d409bce</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:19:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628780369</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T14:59:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook may be forced to sell Giphy following UK regulator findings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK&#39;s competition regulator has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns?=0">found</a> that Facebook&#39;s acquisition of GIF-sharing platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">Giphy</a> will harm competition within social media and digital advertising. As part of its provisional <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d39ce90e0705481fbfb8/Facebook_GIPHY_-_Summary_of_Provisional_Findings.pdf">decision</a>, the watchdog voiced concerns that Facebook could prevent rivals including TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy, a service they already use. It added that Facebook could also require customers of the GIF platform to hand over more data in return for access. If its objections are confirmed as part of the ongoing review, the regulator said it could force Facebook to unwind the deal and to sell off Giphy in its entirety.</p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ultimately determined that the deal stands to increase Facebook&#39;s sizeable market power. Together, its suite of apps — including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram — account for 70 percent of social media activity and are accessed at least once a month by 80 percent of internet users, the CMA said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond social media, the watchdog suggested that the acquisition could remove a potential challenger to Facebook in the $5.5 billion display advertising market. Citing Facebook&#39;s termination of Giphy&#39;s paid ad partnerships following the deal, the regulator said the move had effectively stopped the company&#39;s ad expansion (including to additional countries like the UK) in its tracks. This in turn had an impact on innovation in the broader advertising sector, the CMA explained.</p><p>Facebook&#39;s announcement last May that it was acquiring Giphy, with plans to integrate it with Instagram, for a reported $400 million immediately raised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">alarm bells</a> for regulators. The social network is facing antitrust complaints in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">US</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-facebook-antitrust-probe-105245913.html">EU</a> over its social media and advertising monopolies, respectively. At the same time, the UK has ramped up its scrutiny of Big Tech by creating a dedicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-digital-markets-unit-big-tech-031053255.html">Digital Markets Unit</a> to oversee the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple. The fledgling agency sits within the CMA and is designed to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Today, the CMA echoed those principles in its initial decision. The regulator said that it would &quot;take the necessary actions&quot; to protect users if it concludes that the merger is detrimental to competition. It will now consult on its findings as part of the reviews process. A final decision is slated for October 6th.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson told Engadget<em>&nbsp;</em>that it &quot;disagrees&quot; with the CMA&#39;s preliminary findings. “We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence. As we have demonstrated, this merger is in the best interest of people and businesses in the UK - and around the world - who use GIPHY and our services. We will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”&nbsp;</p><p>It previously argued that Giphy has no operations in the UK, meaning that the CMA has no jurisdiction over the deal. In addition, it has claimed that Giphy&#39;s paid services cannot be classified as display advertising under the regulator&#39;s own market definition.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c68f0768-f104-42a1-8060-3df9ba1fa808</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 11:35:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628769255</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T11:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Erin Scott / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019.

The Flip series seems like the foldable device for now, melding how we use our smartphones in 2021 with foldable screens that are, let’s be honest, still not quite perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung has expanded the external screen so it functions better for checking notifications or using the cameras without opening the Flip 3. Not that I need an excuse to flip open the satisfying hinge on the thing. I’ll wait for Cherlynn Low’s full review on both phones, however, before I start getting into preorders.

What a lot of people had written off as <em>Family Guy</em>- or <em>Rick and Morty</em>-Trek ended up being a wholesome love letter to the history of the franchise.

Luckily, <em>Lower Decks</em> creator and executive producer Mike McMahan was a big fan with deep knowledge of Trek. He is also the creator of the <a href="https://twitter.com/tng_s8?lang=en">@TNG_S8</a> parody Twitter account, as well as a veteran of animated shows like <em>South Park</em>, <em>Axe Cop</em> and, yes, <em>Rick and Morty</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe37c6e0-f945-11eb-bffb-387157ecf4fd" alt="Pictured (L-R): Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler, Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford and No&#xc3;&#xab;l Wells as Ensign Tendi of the CBS All Access series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

(It turned out to be a party in honor of the senior officers, which confused our protagonists even more.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/31e46250-f946-11eb-befa-04fd9e959d20" alt="Pictured Gillian Vigman as Dr. T&#39;ana, Jerry O&#39;Connell as Commander Ransom, Dawnn Lewis as Captain Freeman, Paul Scheer as Lt.

But Star Trek doesn’t have a good track record of sticking to a concept. The majority of shows since <em>TNG</em> have started out as one thing and become something else over the course of their runs. All shows evolve, but the changes in Trek have been obvious and purposeful. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ds9-kingdom-solar-opposites-170043593.html"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a> was intended to be a “frontier outpost” type of show, showing the long-term relationship between the Starfleet and one of the planets it encountered, Bajor. By season three they were given a warship, and season four brought in <em>TNG</em>-veteran Worf and a war with the Klingon Empire.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> operated on the premise of “what if a Starfleet ship was lost far from home?” And it stuck with that, sure, but it also continued to operate like any other Starfleet vessel over seven seasons, and the ship remained in surprisingly good condition despite the lack of spacedocks for repair — something that frustrated writer Ronald D. Moore and later spurred him to create the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/battlestar%20galactica"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a> reboot (the title ship was a wreck by the finale). They also ended up re-establishing contact with the Federation in later seasons, which dampened the whole “alone in a strange quadrant” theme.</p><div id="0f8cede6cc884f58ae30e477e765c3d8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxdKo0eXUKY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Enterprise</em> wasn’t even called Star Trek until its third season. But still, though it was a show that promised to show us the early origins of Starfleet and the Federation, the first two seasons got bogged down in a “Temporal Cold War” and later episodes brought in 24th-century-era baddies like the Borg and Ferengi.</p><p>The latest concept switcheroo was the premiere <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> Trek show, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Discovery</em></a>. The producers touted it as the first series where the captain was not the main character, with the program focusing on Commander Michael Burnham instead. This sounded great in theory, as it could show us a different side of Starfleet. In practice, however, even if Burnham wasn’t the captain the entire universe seemed to revolve around her anyway: the mysterious “Red Angel〞of season two turned out to be her mother (and her). The show ended up jettisoning its 23rd century setting after that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-trailer-040651412.html">traveling to the 32nd century</a> to a galaxy with a Federation in tatters. As of the end of season three Burnham became the captain anyway. So much for any <em>Lower Decks</em>-esque perspective on that show.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8fa67590-f946-11eb-97ef-5abb2fa37bb0" data-uuid="0c37f1dd-e756-3180-865f-81c694a5e3d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Season two of <em>Lower Decks</em> starts off a bit shaky in that regard — after the events of the last few episodes, Mariner is now BFF with the captain (who is also her mother) and Boimler is a bridge officer on the <em>USS Titan</em>. Neither of them feel like the scrappy underdog anymore. At least Tendi and Rutherford are still pretty minor players, though Tendi is alarmed at sudden changes in Rutherford’s personality and worries she may be losing his friendship.</p><p>The premiere finds Mariner having the carte blanche to go on any side missions she wants, and in one of these authorized-unauthorized missions she accidentally turns first officer Jack Ransom into a god-like being set on taking over a planet. The latter event is, at least, a pretty standard plot contrivance for Star Trek. Where <em>Lower Decks</em> stands apart is that as Ransom is threatening the <em>Cerritos</em> and banging away at its shields, the camera cuts to Tendi attacking Rutherford in a corridor, afraid that his new personality traits mean he’s suffering a serious disease, or that he just doesn’t like her anymore. The larger existential threat is background color in this scene (literally, as you can see rainbow beams blasting outside the window) while the show chooses to focus on the individual struggles of these two characters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1119f480-f947-11eb-bb74-ad0191d975c2" data-uuid="e25407be-af10-3c12-9ad6-dfe94b3155b8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>By the end of the episode Rutherford and Tendi sort things out, and even Mariner gets put back in her place, with the partnership between her and her mother dissolved and Beckett back in the brig. The only missing piece of the fabulous four is Boimler and well, he’s not having a great time on the <em>Titan</em>, because maybe things are a bit too exciting up on the bridge. The lower decks of the <em>USS Cerritos</em> are the still place to be, with season two off to a solid start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e070795-f474-4950-b0fe-ebc97b17056a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628539351</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:02:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d3312e0-f945-11eb-a9f5-d304df63cf07" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d3312e0-f945-11eb-a9f5-d304df63cf07" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Strange Energies" -- Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi, Eugene Cordero. as Ensign Rutherford and Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner of the U.S.S.

At the same time, it&#39;s making it more difficult for contributors to join the Partner Program based on follower numbers and other criteria, the platform <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">announced</a> yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>When Medium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-23-mediums-subscription-offers-all-you-can-read-stories-for-5.html">launched</a> its Partner Platform, it used a Netflix-like model that let subscribers access all content for $5 per month of $50 per year. Contributors would then get paid based on how much time members spent reading their content — if a member spent 10 percent of their time on one writer&#39;s work, that writer would get 10 percent of the subscriber&#39;s payments. At the same time, if a reader converted to a paying member within 30 days of reading a writer&#39;s work, the writer would credit for that time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the new model, writers in the Partner Program will have a personalized referral landing page. If a reader purchases a subscription via a writer&#39;s page, the writer will get half the fee for the entire life of the subscription — minus payment processing fees. So, for every 100 members who sign up via a partner&#39;s referral landing page, that partner will make $201 per month.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>You can leverage your landing page however you’d like: share it on social platforms, link to it on Medium post pages, or include it on your profile. Directing your readers to this page is completely optional.</p></blockquote><p>At the same time, when a non-paying reader subscribes to a writer&#39;s email, they&#39;ll automatically be given the option to convert to a Medium member. If they do, that will count toward the writer&#39;s referral earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Medium noted that subscriber referral earnings will be in addition to Partner Program earnings based on member read time. Presumably, however, there would be less money to go around from referred subscribers, since half their revenue would be going to the referring partner.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Medium has made it a bit more difficult to become a partner. Going forward, writers must have at least 100 follower and one published Medium story. Even if you meet all those requirements, you might lose your status if you don&#39;t publish anything within a six month period. Existing partners will retain their status until the end of 2021, and if they haven&#39;t reached the requirements at that point, they&#39;ll be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Medium&#39;s new model appears to be a response to Substack in particular, which pays writers based on their paid subscriber totals. Substack is more generous to individual writers, taking just 10 percent of their revenue compared to the 50 percent for medium, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Unlike Substack, though, Medium readers get access to everything on the platform, not just a single writer&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mediums-partner-program-will-start-paying-writers-for-subscriber-referrals-044932271.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7540bdd1-22cc-4bbb-8864-333abc5ba90b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:49:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628743772</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T04:49:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pheelings Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of black man hands typing on a laptop sitting on a desk at home]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black man hands typing on a laptop at home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[German animal shelter is posting profiles of adoptable pets on Tinder]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Munich Animal Welfare Association has taken <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/purrfect-match-animal-shelter-puts-lonely-pets-tinder-2021-08-11/">a unique approach</a> to matching its resident adoptable pets with their new forever homes: putting their profiles on popular dating app, Tinder.

Penned by Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and co-sponsored by Amy Klobuchar, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amy-klobuchar-antitrust-senate-bill-171401466.html">chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee</a>, the proposed legislation would &quot;prevent app stores from disadvantaging developers.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Open App Markets Act</a> reads like a wishlist of items groups like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-spotify-and-others-form-alliance-against-app-store-dominance-135026221.html">Coalition for App Fairness</a> have advocated for in their fight against Apple and Google. So it should come as no surprise the organization has come out in support of the proposed legislation. One of the most noteworthy provisions included in the bill&#39;s current iteration is a clause that would prohibit app marketplace owners from forcing third-party developers to use a payment system they own. Another provision aimed almost exclusively at Apple would force platform holders to allow consumers to sideload software and install third-party app stores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Payment systems have been one of the issues at the heart of the recent antitrust movement. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">kicked Epic Games off the App Store</a> after the studio implemented a way for <em>Fortnit</em>e players to skirt its 30 percent fee. Google, meanwhile, announced at the end of 2020 that it would give developers until later this year to make their apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">compliant with the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>.</p><p>&quot;The legislation would help create a more competitive app marketplace that will ignite innovation in the digital economy, and provide more options for American consumers,&quot; the Coalition for App Fairness said in a statement.</p><p>Outside of the CAF, organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Internet Accountability Project support the bill. Of course, introducing legislation and passing it are two very different things.
