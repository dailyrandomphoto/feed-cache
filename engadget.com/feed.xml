This year, in addition to launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-2022-blade-lineup-ces-170053808.html">new laptops</a>, it’s also teamed up with smartwatch maker Fossil to launch a special edition wearable. The two companies are announcing the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch at CES 2022 and it’s basically what you think: A themed version of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">existing Wear OS device</a> with straps and faces that reflect the gaming company’s identity.</p><p>But the Razer edition of the Gen 6 has some small differences. It only comes in the 44mm size (while the original is also available in 42mm) and also features some unique interface elements. I’ve had a sample to play with for awhile, and frankly, this feels like most Fossil smartwatches, just with an aesthetic nod to Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fossil Gen 6 was the first to feature Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Snapdragon Wear 4100+</a> chip, and like the original series, the Razer edition will be updated to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">new Wear OS 3</a> later this year. So far, the existing software on the watch felt familiar and performed quickly. I swiped through cards and changed watch faces with no delay, though that’s par for the course for Wear OS watches these days. The three custom watch faces for the Razer-branded wearable were what I expected — that is, they had matching color schemes and displayed the time in &quot;fun&quot; fonts. The Wellness face shows your daily stats, but doesn’t look very Razer-esque.</p><p>There’s not much else different about the device, and most other elements like battery life and system performance require me spending much more time with it to test.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/54996550-6db5-11ec-ae3a-84efc5dfd407" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist and the exclusive Wellness watch face. " data-uuid="e489acd5-c310-35aa-a176-36b87a551ae1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I <em>can</em> say now is that as a person with smaller wrists, the Razer watch is a bit too big for me. Are most Razer fans people more big-boned, or do they prefer a chunky aesthetic? I don’t know, but it sure seems like that assumption is being made.</p><p>One thing I do believe Razer’s loyalists love is the company’s distinct acid green color that permeates their products. The special edition Gen 6 comes in a black finish with a black 22mm band with no pops of green on the case itself. But it does come with a bright green strap that you can swap out. Both silicone bands were pliable and comfortable, though, again, I’d prefer a narrower style.</p><p>The larger size does allow for a roomier screen (though the 42mm Gen 6 has the same display dimensions), and I enjoyed how easy it was to read app titles and notifications.</p><p>Razer and Fossil are only selling 1,337 units of this special edition device, because Leet, get it? Anyway, you can get one for $329. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 6 costs between $299 and $319. With its higher price and limited quantity, the Razer watch is clearly meant to be a collectible for the most loyal of the company’s fans.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/776be2b0-6db5-11ec-b37e-3e69af314d21" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist, showing a list of apps including one called " data-uuid="6e2dedc3-6ab0-3feb-82b2-d427374d62c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don’t manage to get one of the Razer watches or are intrigued by Fossil’s other brands, you could also consider the new Skagen Gen 6. The Skagen Falster is my favorite of Fossil’s smartwatches, and the company is launching an updated version that offers its latest suite of features like the Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, faster battery charging and upgraded sensors. It’ll be available in six styles and cost $295.</p><p>Fossil also told Engadget that the Gen 6 series will be getting Alexa support early this year, so those who use Amazon’s assistant for smart home device control can do that from their wrists.</p><p>The Razer x Fossil watch represents an intriguing expansion of Fossil’s lineup, though we might see the company team up with other brands in future. Fossil told me it’s open to the idea, so who knows? Maybe one day we’ll see collabs with the likes of Tesla, McDonalds or, oh God, White Castle.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-x-fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-hands-on-160052253.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96562190-44ea-4765-89e2-1b11467c1d85</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641354696</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T03:51:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with acid green straps on a wrist.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo's ultrawide 17-inch laptop has an 8-inch screen next to the keyboard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="3ba00dbee7b543e091b5bd5d497ac691"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNK7xDUdhL4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Lenovo always unveils a cornucopia of gadgets at CES and this year is no different. In addition to smart home products and various laptops, the company is showing off an unconventional approach to PCs. Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-e-ink-screen-hands-on.html">introducing the ThinkBook Plus series in 2020</a>, Lenovo has used it as a platform to roll out unusual form factors, like the previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-2-i-e-ink-screen-laptop-170048754.html">iteration with an e-ink screen on its lid</a>.</p><p>Now that the laptop is in its third generation, Lenovo is moving its second panel down to the keyboard deck and making it a full-color LCD instead. Not only is this approach more useful, it’s also potentially more power-intensive. At a recent hands-on in New York (held in accordance with COVID-19 regulations), I checked out the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 and, in spite of some bugs, I’m intrigued by the premise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The laptop’s main screen is a 17.3 inch IPS display that runs at a 3K resolution. It’s accompanied by an 8-inch 800 x 1,280 LCD to the right of the keyboard and features an integrated digitizer layer to enable stylus support. The machine runs an interesting version of Windows 11 that offers several more orientations, in addition to the typical snap shortcuts that you see when you hover over an app’s title bar.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/81a8bb60-6de5-11ec-8fed-a1c22184d118" alt="A close up of the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, focusing on a dialog box showing seven different app layout options. " data-uuid="ede3f749-3fca-3112-b5d9-915215ec3f88"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>On the ThinkBook Plus, when you drag an app, a small dialog box pops up with two suggested layouts (and five more appear when you hover over an arrow here). Windows 11 will just see the 8-inch LCD as an external screen and push out content the way it would to your connected monitors. You can choose to snap a window to take up the whole bottom panel, half of it, cover the entire top display, take up only two thirds of it and more. The most unconventional of these layouts is something Lenovo called “waterfall” where an app can spill over the top screen into the bottom, which could be nifty for extra long lists.</p><p>I dragged a long spreadsheet into waterfall mode, for example, and could see entire columns at a glance. Or say you’re watching a live-changing Ted Talk up top and want to jot down notes by hand. Writing on the demo unit was surprisingly smooth with satisfying latency. I also appreciated the position of the pad because it felt more intuitive than trying to draw on a laptop’s display.</p><p>During my hands-on, the ThinkBook Plus was responsive at snapping apps where I wanted them to go and did so quickly. But it struggled when launching some other functions that Lenovo built into the lower display.</p><p>There’s a whiteboard tool that turns the panel into a notepad, as well as a digital numpad. With supported apps like Adobe Lightroom, you can also have a dedicated dashboard of shortcuts or a magnified view sitting next to the keyboard. Lenovo made a “Magic Launcher,” which is a row of buttons at the bottom of this screen for quick access to the whiteboard, numpad and other specialized software.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ae518840-6de5-11ec-bfff-6cd0fa3ba023" alt="A close up of the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3&#39;s 8-inch screen with the words " data-uuid="2f533302-0555-3368-a23b-b707ab10f5b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>This was the most buggy part of my hands-on experience. Sometimes, tapping the buttons wouldn’t work (or would take more than a few seconds before anything happened). The demo unit crashed at least once, too. But we’re at least a few months away from May, when Lenovo expects to sell these machines, so it has some time to iron out these kinks.</p><p>The rest of the system performed as expected. The main 17.3-inch IPS display runs at 3,072 x 1,440, which is an aspect ratio of 21:10. It’s easy enough to split three apps on that roomy screen, though if you want to use all of it for editing pictures in Lightroom, at least you can keep an eye on Slack or Twitter with the bottom display.</p><p>Keeping all this running is a 12th-generation Intel Core processor with up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM. It uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-xe-gpu-gamers-130000411.html">Intel’s Xe graphics with Unified Memory Architecture</a>, which should be powerful enough for some photo editing. There&#39;s also a Full HD IR camera with a privacy shutter and an array of ports including an HDMI socket, two USB A jacks and a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d188bae0-6de5-11ec-9eef-d288ce2d18eb" alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 sitting on a round white table with a stylus next to it. The laptop shows Adobe Lighthouse taking up the left half of the main display, while an oversized numpad appears on the 8-inch screen to the right of the keyboard." data-uuid="95fb04e2-024a-396e-b1df-dffac3cf4895"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that the battery size here is 69 Whr, which is pretty typical for most laptops this size. But most laptops this size don&#39;t also have a secondary monitor to power, so we&#39;ll have to wait till we can test one out for ourselves to get a sense for real-world endurance. You&#39;ll only be able to get these in May, and they&#39;ll start at $1,399.</p><p>Lenovo also announced a slew of other products in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-13-lenovo-thinkbook-and-thinkpad-x1-extreme.html">ThinkBook</a> and ThinkCentre family of business-minded devices. There’s the updated <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkbook-13x-review-is-this-business-laptop-worth-dollar1200">ThinkBook 13x</a> Gen 2, which can work with a “Wireless Multi-Device Charging Mat” that recharges Qi-compatible gadgets while also powering the laptop itself. The company also debuted a new ThinkCentre Neo line comprising three desktop systems for small and medium businesses. Finally, the new ThinkBook 14 and 16 Gen 4+ i (yes, that’s part of the name, not a stray letter) sport 16:10 screens running at 90Hz and 120Hz respectively, among other updates.</p><p>The ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 is one of the most eye-catching things I&#39;ve seen this CES, though that’s not to say Lenovo is breaking new ground. ASUS has already made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review.html">several dual-screen laptops</a> in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zenbook-duo-review-dual-screen-ultraportable-140045662.html">ZenBook Pro Duo series</a>, and Lenovo itself also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-17-lenovo-yoga-book-review.html">tried before</a> with the ill-fated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-lenovo-yoga-book-c930-review-an-expensive-experiment.html">Yoga Book</a> line. Dell and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-29-intel-dual-screen-laptop-prototype-hands-on.html">Intel</a> have shown off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ori-duet-foldable-dual-screen-pc-hands-on-2020.html">some concepts</a>, too  and I&#39;m very intrigued by the premise here. With Windows 11’s release last year, it seems like more PC makers could be ready to deliver real dual-screen laptops and we could see more of them in 2022. As a taste of what’s to come, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 is tantalizing and I applaud Lenovo for continuing to try and innovate.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-3-dual-screen-laptop-hands-on-price-specs-availability-160028888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">363f2653-2897-4242-b0ff-c02a8bbe79a9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641393765</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T14:43:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/09434f60-6de4-11ec-b79b-ff163956c328" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/09434f60-6de4-11ec-b79b-ff163956c328" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 on a table showing Lightroom on the top screen and the Engadget website on the screen at the bottom next to the keyboard.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM connects your PC to Xbox, Switch and PS4]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM is the next evolution of IOGEAR&#39;s connective hardware for PC and consoles, and it&#39;s due to come out between April and June 2022 for $200. It specifically supports Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 4 consoles, making it possible to play any game on those systems with a keyboard, mouse, monitor and headset connected to a PC.</p><p>The name of the game here is <em>streamlining</em>. The Nexus Gaming KVM brings multiple consoles to a single screen and input system on the PC, while also allowing users to swap among Switch, Xbox One and PS4 controllers. It supports video at 4K and 60Hz, using HDMI 2.1.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now to address the ninth-generation elephant in the room: The Nexus Gaming KVM doesn&#39;t fully support PS5 or the DualSense controllers. This is in line with previous iterations of the KeyMander switches, which also have limited functionality with PS5.</p><p>&quot;We have limited support for PS5, can only play PS4 and non-DualSense PS5 games,&quot; an IOGEAR spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We are looking to launch a dongle in late Q2 that may bring full support.&quot; Q2 ends ends in June 2022, the spokesperson clarified.</p><p>IOGEAR has been talking about that dongle for <a href="http://keymander2.com/thread/606/67">about seven months</a> now, and the use of &quot;may&quot; in that statement isn&#39;t reassuring. Sony&#39;s DualSense controllers for the PS5 include a range of new features, like adaptive triggers and ultra-sensitive haptics, and several titles actually require this gamepad to function. This makes it difficult to translate PS5 games to a standard input method like a keyboard and mouse. However, IOGEAR says it&#39;s still trying.</p><p>There are ways to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/games-with-mouse-and-keyboard-support-on-xbox-one-series-x-series-s">play certain games</a> with a keyboard and mouse plugged directly into consoles, but these titles are limited. Not only does the Nexus Gaming KVM unlock this input method for every game on supported systems, but it keeps things organized by running each console through a single monitor and headset, negating the need to swap screens and controllers. Unless you have a PS5, for now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iogear-keymander-nexus-gaming-kvm-xbox-switch-ps4-keyboard-mouse-160016494.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">028630d6-88b4-4e9d-bf6b-35a45d7da917</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641393996</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T14:46:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1d4cf130-6d91-11ec-baff-03b72b4237a6" width="596" height="367" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1d4cf130-6d91-11ec-baff-03b72b4237a6" width="596" height="367" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IOGEAR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo packs new AMD and Intel CPUs into slimmer Legion gaming laptops]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lenovo is bombarding CES 2022 with a wave of new PCs, and it won&#39;t surprise to hear that gaming laptops play an important role. The company has introduced seventh-generation Legion 5 (shown below) and Legion 5 Pro (above) portables that are cooler and thinner while packing new AMD <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-6000-mobile-cpu-rdna2-gaming-160037129.html">Ryzen 6000</a> and Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html">12th-gen Core</a> CPUs. The AMD-based 5 Pro and Intel-based 5i Pro are sleeker than their predecessors, but offer the latest chips thanks to a revamped cooling system with slimmer fans, a larger exhaust area, a copper block heat sink and a more effective heat pipe layout — hopefully, the thermal issues with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html">last year&#39;s models</a> are no more.</p><p>You can also expect options for the latest GeForce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html">RTX 30 series GPUs</a>, improved WiFi 6e performance and a 16-inch 2,960 x 1,600 IPS panel with a rare 240Hz adaptive refresh rate. You&#39;ll also find up to 1TB of SSD storage, four-zone RGB lighting and up to 300W charging with a proprietary solution (135W through USB-C). The Legion 5i Pro arrives in February starting at $1,570, while the 5 Pro debuts in April for $1,430.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57b2b440-6daa-11ec-bbfb-7e92ed2cea07" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Lenovo Legion 5i gaming laptop (2022)" data-uuid="3b51886a-baab-3393-bdae-d21abbe84ac1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>Cost-conscious gamers won&#39;t have to give up much. The non-Pro Legion 5 and 5i models also use new AMD, Intel and NVIDIA parts, but they&#39;re 15 percent thinner while boasting more powerful fan systems and larger exhaust areas. They should feel better on your lap, too, thanks to an aluminum-magnesium hybrid cover. The 15-inch, 165Hz 1440p screen won&#39;t be quite as impressive as what you&#39;ll find on the Pro models, but it still offers a speedy 165Hz refresh rate and full sRGB color space coverage. Four-zone RGB is optional.</p><p>The regular Legion 5i ships in February starting at $1,200. Wait until April and you can buy the AMD-powered Legion 5 from $1,130.</p><p>This being Lenovo, there&#39;s also a slew of peripherals on deck. The 24.5-inch Legion Y25-30 monitor (due in May for $340) mates a 240Hz refresh rate and DisplayHDR 400 support with a high-accuracy IPS panel, while 24- and 27-inch G24qe-20 and G27qe-20 monitors (both coming in March for $260 and $300) provide the basics. The Legion M600s ($85, May) is a lightweight, ambidextrous wireless gaming mouse with a 19,000DPI sensor, while the M300s wired mouse ($30, May) packs RGB lighting and an 8,000 DPI sensor.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-gaming-laptops-ces-2022-160013358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b980f6b-592a-4940-a29a-f60afa89920f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641335519</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T22:32:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a57faf10-6da6-11ec-bdea-c34b98fc3823" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a57faf10-6da6-11ec-bdea-c34b98fc3823" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lenovo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer and Fossil made a limited edition smartwatch for gamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s now a more affordable way to wear your devotion to gaming on your wrist. <a href="https://press.razer.com/">Razer</a> and Fossil have teamed up to release a limited-edition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Gen 6 smartwatch</a> built with gamers in mind. The new wristwear adds three custom watch faces — yes, including an RGB-inspired &quot;Chroma&quot; face. You&#39;ll also receive two custom silicone straps that include a sober black and Razer&#39;s iconic (if slightly eye-searing) green.</p><p>This is otherwise the Gen 6 you&#39;ve come to know. The 44mm steel case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Snapdragon Wear 4100+</a> chip, 3ATM water resistance, blood oxygen monitoring and 1.28-inch circular display will be familiar if you&#39;ve shopped Fossil&#39;s recent smartwatches. Not these are necessarily bad things — the Razer watch should be a fast, capable timepiece. You won&#39;t get LTE and you&#39;ll have just 8GB of storage, but the very fast charging (80 percent in 30 minutes) should keep the device powered even if you regularly use sleep tracking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Razer x Fossil watch will be available worldwide later in January for a reasonable $329. You&#39;ll need to scramble to get one, though. The two companies are making an appropriately nerdy 1,337 units, so you might have to &#39;settle&#39; for a standard Gen 6.

Today, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-z13-z16-amd-only-laptop-line-160009720.html">Lenovo’s</a> turn, busting out a refreshed range of ThinkPad X1 and Yoga machines with new, 12th-generation Intel Core chips and plenty of razzle-dazzle.</p><p>The flagship X1 range is welcoming a 10th-generation X1 Carbon, seventh-generation X1 Yoga and a second-generation X1 Nano. Those high-end machines are targeted at professionals currently caught between the office and working from home, like so many of us are these days. That means the big focus is making sure you don’t look completely awful while you’re sat in yet another endless Zoom meeting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That’s why these new models all get a redesigned “communications bar,” which is a fancy way of describing the webcam housing. Nestled inside you’ll find a “superior camera,” with a number of options, including a standard HD camera or an FHD + IR camera, paired with quad-array microphones. You can also opt for a Computer Vision bundle that, Lenovo promises, will be able to automatically detect which person is in front of the machine for a faster log-in experience.</p><p>You can also spec these machines with OLED displays, a 2.8k option for the X1 Carbon and a full 4K OLED for the X1 Yoga. Plus, there’s WiFi 6E, options for 4G or 5G modems and support for Tile’s finding features to help you never misplace your machine. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 10) and Yoga (Gen 7) will be available in March, with prices starting at $1,639 and $1,749, respectively. The X1 Nano (Gen 2), meanwhile, will turn up a month later in April, with the base model due to cost $1,659.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ed3fcff0-6e1a-11ec-bbbf-d4772fd5fbdd" style="height:800;width:1280;" alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i" data-uuid="5d392908-5268-363d-8ab5-bd1533f35149"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>At the same time, Lenovo also wants to talk about its not-X line of Yoga machines, including the Yoga 9i, Yoga 71 and Yoga 6. The 9i is the flagship 2-in-1 for the year, which comes with the option of new 12th-generation Intel Core chips paired with Iris Xe graphics — making it an Intel Evo-certified machine. Lenovo says that this new model has vastly-improved (Bowers and Wilkins’) audio which is much louder than before, too. You’ll also be able to get the 9i with a 16:10, 4K OLED IPS touchscreen with 100 percent DCI-P3 color accuracy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 7i gets the option of a 2.8K OLED touchscreen (for the 14-inch) or a 2.5K LCD 60Hz display (for the 16-inch model). Both get the option of a Intel Core i7, paired with Iris Xe graphics, rapid charging and screens optimized for graphics professionals. The Yoga 6, meanwhile, is designed to burnish Lenovo’s environmental credentials, with its recycled aluminum cover or fabric-wrapped cover made with 50 percent recycled plastics.</p><p>You can expect to get your hands on the Yoga 9i at some point in Q2, 2022, with the base model available for $1,399. The 16-inch Yoga 7i will retail for $899, while its smaller sibling will set you back $949 before you’ve started speccing it up, and both arrive in Q2 this year as well. Finally, the Yoga 6 with a Ryzen 5000 will require you to hand over $749, and if you guessed that these would also drop at some point in Q2, you deserve a cookie.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-carbon-x-1-x-1-nano-x1-yoga-i9-2022-update-160002156.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b75c8ab0-1f7a-40ac-944e-5e43ef6ff33a</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641382758</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:39:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a83c4550-6e1a-11ec-b319-22c352cd16f9" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a83c4550-6e1a-11ec-b319-22c352cd16f9" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lenovo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the new ThinkPad.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ring's new Glass Break sensor does exactly what you think]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ring" href="https://amzn.to/34e9fay">Ring</a> is today beefing up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">home</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html">security</a> portfolio with a new Glass Break Sensor which does the job you already guessed it does based on the name.

Amazon and Lockheed Martin have <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-take-me-to-the-moon">revealed</a> NASA will carry Alexa to space aboard the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-i-sls-launch-date-163749274.html">Artemis I mission</a> launching later in 2022. While that flight is uncrewed, the companies are planning a &quot;virtual crew experience&quot; at NASA&#39;s Johnson Space Center that will let people in Mission Control (including students and special guests) simulate conversations between the digital helper and astronauts.</p><p>This is decidedly more sophisticated than the Alexa on your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo speaker</a>. Alexa will have access to the Orion spacecraft&#39;s telemetry data, answer &quot;thousands&quot; of mission-related questions and even control devices like cabin lighting. Amazon has finessed its algorithms to consider Orion&#39;s acoustics. Connectivity in space shouldn&#39;t be an issue, either. The Callisto technology payload carrying Alexa will both allow local voice control (even with no internet access) and access the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-australia-deep-space-station-upgrade-133000935.html">Deep Space Network</a> to provide news from home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initiative isn&#39;t just about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html">bragging rights</a> or bringing a <em>Star Trek</em>-style computer to life. Amazon will use the lessons learned from Artemis I to improve Alexa both for future missions and for everyday users, particularly those who have little to no internet connectivity. The company is also adding new Alexa experiences that will give you access to Artemis I&#39;s telemetry, imagery, video (including the launch livestream) and notifications for key mission milestones.</p><p>Amazon is hoping to foster the next wave of space explorers in the process. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/space">introducing</a> an Alexa for Astronauts program that provides access to the virtual crew experience, digital tours of the Johnson Space Center and a STEM curriculum built withe the help of the National Science Teaching Association and Mobile CSP. The move helps Amazon burnish its reputation, of course, but it could be worthwhile if it encourages more students to pursue space industry careers.</p><div id="b5a686023cea4d79a0675b6a3fd97366"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWv0l4YPS1E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alexa-in-space-nasa-artemis-mission-143518042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54b48d7b-d53b-41e1-911a-b1f8251681de</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 14:35:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641392432</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T14:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b95c2bb0-6e2a-11ec-bbef-7f7b9337a21f" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b95c2bb0-6e2a-11ec-bbef-7f7b9337a21f" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alexa in the Callisto payload aboard NASA's Artemis I mission]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alexa in the Callisto payload aboard NASA's Artemis I mission]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Sony's CES 2022 keynote in under nine minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="c5f8cdb3c3a84c069ce7619e37693a35"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANPka1CpwUg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Sony&#39;s CES 2022 press conference was jammed with information, as it revealed more details on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html">PlayStation VR2</a> and plans to launch an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-vision-s-02-electric-suv-mobility-inc-071335668.html">electric car company</a>.

The sleek machine earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">score of 89</a> from us thanks in part to its fast performance and updated design, and now you can pick up the silver model for less at Amazon. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:24-inch iMac" href="https://amzn.to/3HIHxS1">24-inch iMac M1</a> with an 8-core CPU and a 7-core GPU, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is down to $1,249, or $50 off its normal price. Only the silver model is this low right now, and the last time it saw a similar discount was back in July of last year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HIHxS1" id="b5d8f40c32ad44ec89cfedbe1e9e8b2f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 24-inch iMac M1 at Amazon - $1,249</a><p>Apple&#39;s M1 chipset powers the latest iMacs, delivering noticeable performance improvements over previous models. The desktop can handle video editing, spreadsheet work and even Apple Arcade gaming without breaking a sweat, and wakes almost instantaneously from sleeping and only takes around 25 seconds to boot in a cold start. It also has a stunning 4.5K Retina Display that can show over one billion colors and reach up to 500 nits of brightness, so everything from photos to videos pops on this screen. Plus, the under-10-pound iMac is pretty easy to move around, so while you may just want to park it in one room of your home, you can move it when necessary without much effort.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Our biggest gripes with the iMac are its lack of vertical screen adjustment and its USB-C only port array. The base model, which is the one on sale, only has two USB-C ports — and you&#39;ll have to spring for the $1,499 8-core GPU version in order to get two more. That means that you&#39;ll most certainly be living the dongle life if you invest in this laptop, and that&#39;s an inconvenience that might be too much for some. You do get the color-matching Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard with this desktop, though, and while there are more comfortable combos out there, they will work just fine for most people.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-24-inch-imac-m1-is-cheaper-than-ever-on-amazon-right-now-135540267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66e41088-b24f-4886-80ac-cb66be822c27</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:55:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641390536</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:48:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart's InHome Delivery service will reach up to 30 million households in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/01/05/walmart-to-expand-inhome-delivery-reaching-30-million-u-s-homes-in-2022">big plans</a> for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-07-walmart-delivery-stock-fridge.html">InHome delivery service</a> in 2022, aiming to expand it from 6 million households to 30 million by the end of the year. To achieve that, it will hire more than 3,000 full-time associate delivery drivers and build out a fleet of all-electric delivery vans.&nbsp;</p><p>The InHome service, which handles more than 160,000 items from 3,400 stores, first launched in 2019.

However, Walmart notes that tips for associates are built into the fee.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once signed up, you can order items from the Walmart app and select InHome as the preferred delivery method. Drivers can unlock the customer&#39;s door using a one-time access code, with a vest-worn camera recording the entire delivery. You can use your own smart lock or purchase one from InHome for $50.&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart said that the new associate delivery driver position is full-time and includes benefits like medical, vision and dental insurance, 401K matching, paid time off and free college degrees. Drivers also get paid a $1.50/hour premium compared to other store workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company plans to equip those workers with a fleet of all-electric vans.

If your last one was “I can’t find a USB mic I like,” then 512 Audio might be about to ruin your (procrastinator’s) day. The company is unveiling two USB microphones at CES this year along with a podcast-friendly audio interface.</p><p>If you do (or plan on doing) a lot of vocal work, the $119 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/script">Script</a> microphone might be the one to consider. The vintage styling is based on Warm Audio’s WA-14 studio condenser microphone (512 Audio is a subsidiary of Warm). The Script is dual-pattern (Cardioid/Omni) and the dual 14mm capsules are tuned to vocal work, so the company claims. Thanks to its USB connection, the Script offers zero-latency monitoring via a headphone jack and onboard gain/mute controls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Should you want a microphone that’s a little more versatile, then the $160 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/tempest">Tempest</a> might be a better fit. Like the Script, there are onboard monitoring and volume controls. The Tempest also offers a larger, 34mm capsule, for those that want a more responsive sound. This model, too, is based on one of Warm’s existing microphones – specifically the <a href="https://warmaudio.com/wa47jr/">WA 47Jr</a>. Though we don’t know if these microphones are just USB versions of the ones they mimic or are simply visually inspired by them (at the very least, the WA14 offers more polar patterns than its 512 counterpart).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b55480c0-6e17-11ec-974b-01e8ef54786c" alt="512 Audio announces a new podcast-friendly audio interface." data-uuid="589eb87a-d979-31ab-96fa-008b12666210"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">512 Audio</div></figure><p>With both of the new microphones offering USB connectivity, you won’t need an interface to connect them to your PC, but 512 Audio is unveiling <a href="https://512audio.com/product/audio-interface">one of their own</a> for those that already have XLR microphones and want to plug them into something a little more podcast friendly than a generic interface.</p><p>While there’s no pricing information at this time, the audio interface has two combo ports for the aforementioned XLR mics and or ¼-inch instruments. There’s also a 3.5mm input for phones and other compatible devices. Perfect for introducing a “caller” onto your show or simply for feeding in other audio sources as you see fit. There are two headphone outputs on the front, which is a definite perk for podcasters and even a mute button for the mics which is less common than you might think, and handy in a podcast scenario for talking off-air or avoiding coughs and other unwanted sounds.</p><p>Of all the above, the Tempest will be launching first, slated for March this year. The Script will be available in “spring” and the audio interface will come later this year.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/512-audio-script-tempest-usb-microphones-130018337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9253a5ac-2738-4de3-8e1a-5bde0645b33d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641397685</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T15:48:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Microphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[512 Audio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Sony reveals PlayStation VR2 specs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of course, the year when many media outlets and companies decide to skip on attending CES in person, Sony decides this is the year to make some news at its press conference. While we got more news on its EV plans, and next-gen TVs, Tom Holland was also drafted into the showcase to promote the forthcoming Uncharted feature film.</p><p>Then it hit us with a barrage of specs for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html">next-gen PlayStation VR headset</a>. It will, of course, be compatible with the PS5 and the VR2 Sense controllers we’ve already seen. It will have a display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 pixel per eye, a 110-degree field of view, and be capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates, all while supporting 4K HDR.</p><p>The world of consumer VR has rocketed forward since the original PSVR, so Sony is playing catchup with features like inside-out tracking, which uses multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. There will also be “headset feedback” which sounds like the headset will shake and vibrate like a DualShock/DualSense controller.

The chipmaker has announced that it&#39;s bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html">hybrid 12th-gen CPUs to laptops</a> a few months after they were introduced for desktop computers. These CPUs combine performance cores (P-cores) and efficient cores (E-cores) on a single chip to be able to better handle the demands of various real-world tasks. Their faster cores can power your game, for instance, while the slower cores are taking care of your livestreaming needs. They&#39;ll top out at 14 cores for laptops, which include HP&#39;s updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-elitebook-zbook-january-2022-update-181010578.html">EliteBook and ZBooks</a>, as well as MSI&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-stealth-gs77-ces-2022-annoucement-210010607.html">Stealth GS77 and Stealth GS66</a> gaming laptops. Intel has also revealed that its 12th-gen KS-series chips for desktop, which are arriving this spring, will be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-12th-gen-ks-series-cpu-5-5ghz-181625713.html">reach 5.5GHz</a> on a single core. Plus, it&#39;s adding a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-evo-3rd-edition-foldable-pc-iphone-181039141.html">foldable specification</a> for its premium Evo PC line this year.

Sony says it&#39;s conducting tests in Europe as part of its efforts to release a Level 2+ driver assistance technology on public roads. Inside, there are Time-of-Flight sensors for driver authentication, as well as support for intuitive gesture and voice commands. The vehicle will also have 5G connectivity to enable over-the-air updates and remote operation, which Sony is currently working on with its partners.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Vision-S 02 is just a prototype at the moment, Sony has ambitions to become a player in the electric vehicle industry and sell its cars to the public. It will establish an operating company named &quot;Sony Mobility Inc.&quot; this spring and will explore entry into the EV market. The company didn&#39;t reveal what other steps it&#39;s taking to achieve that goal, and it remains to be seen whether it&#39;ll truly be able to release its Vision-S vehicles. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that Sony has been testing its electric sedan on public roads in Europe since December 2020 and has also started verification tests of the safety and user experience of the vehicle&#39;s imaging and sensing technology.</p><div id="abf27df284b0449d93251bb749937dd2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Innovation of mobility.<br><br>Sony&#39;s Vision-S <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2022</a><a href="https://t.co/lLykDAUapB">pic.twitter.com/lLykDAUapB</a></p>— Sony (@Sony) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sony/status/1478541341764333569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-vision-s-02-electric-suv-mobility-inc-071335668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60de2d9b-559e-4638-a8c4-a03344007281</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 07:13:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641398714</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:05:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/255b9010-6e41-11ec-9fb3-35b3e582df0b" width="3500" height="2044" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/255b9010-6e41-11ec-9fb3-35b3e582df0b" width="3500" height="2044" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Vision-S 02 electric SUV concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Vision-S 02 electric SUV concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrysler's first concept EV could offer up to 400 miles of range]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electrified pickups and SUVs may be all the rage but there&#39;s apparently still plenty of room in the EV market for more battery-powered autos and crossovers.

STLA Brain serves as the vehicle&#39;s central controller, allowing it to receive OTA updates. SmartCockpit, on the other hand, runs the Airflow&#39;s infotainment system, providing navigation and voice control, as well as an on-board app store, for both the driver and passengers. Autodrive will reportedly offer Level 3 self-driving features with the capability for further feature improvements via the those OTA updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Airflow concept is equipped with dual 150kW motors, giving the crossover AWD capabilities and a Chrysler-estimated 350 - 400 mile range. Exterior design details include full-width LED tail lights and 22-inch rims, while the leather-bound interior boasts individual climate control options, separate dash-mounted touchscreens for the driver and front passenger (as well as seat-back mounted screens for both rear passengers), and ambient lighting that shifts based on the passengers’ preferences and what&#39;s playing on the the central displays.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6db67d40-64e4-11ec-afcd-4ee88844483e" alt="Ambient lighting in the Chrysler Airflow Concept reveals itself in direct lines, adding modernity, and syncs to the mood of the interior and changes based on the passengers&#xe2;&#x0020ac;&#x002122; preferences and the content on the displays." data-uuid="14aecd1e-f6a1-3078-b4c0-e962789a2b67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Stellantis</div></figure><p>Being but a concept vehicle, the Airflow that arrives in 2025 could — and likely will — look and perform a bit differently from what was announced today.

As usual, the small black buds take the same completely in canal (CIC) form factor which is what allows them to remain almost entirely out of sight. The &quot;new&quot; stuff is on the inside.</p><p>The flagship feature with the Eargo 6 is called &quot;Sound Adjust.&quot; No prizes for guessing what this does, but the company claims its proprietary algorithm can automatically sense your surroundings and the hearing aids will automatically optimize themselves to give you the best settings for it. Profiles are a fairly standard feature on most hearing aids, but automatic switching is usually something reserved for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/head-to-head-with-two-of-the-most-techenabled-hearing-aids-133039853.html">pricier models</a>, and they all do it with different levels of success, in my experience at least.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The difference here is that the Eargo 6 is much smaller than most of the other products that offer similar technologies. Being tiny is great, and the main selling point here, but it also means there&#39;s much less real estate to fill with sensors and chips. Regardless, Eargo seems to be figuring out clever ways to bring their offerings up to feature parity with their (physically and metaphorically) larger competition.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be CES 2022 without a few COVID-related influences. For the last two years, those with hearing loss have faced a new challenge: Conversing with people who are wearing a mask. Not only does this remove any visual feedback, it also muffles sound — a double blow for those struggling to understand you. As such, the company has introduced a &quot;mask mode&quot; that aims to resolve some of the changes in sound that face coverings create.</p><p>Other tweaks this time around include revised noise reduction with the company claims further reduces background noise allowing the voice to punch through. The Eargo 6 is also rated IPX7 for water resistance. This means they can be submerged for 30 minutes at a depth of one meter without water damage. In practical terms, this means you can probably leave them in while you shower or go for a quick swim. Or, more logically, you can get them a bit when while cleaning them.</p><p>As we&#39;re not physically at CES this year, we haven&#39;t been able to test them like we normally do, but if previous years are anything to go by the plucky little hearing aid is only getting smarter and more useful. As usual, the Eargo 6 is being sold direct to consumers and will retail for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,950" href="https://fave.co/3qTz9rZ">$2,950</a>. In hearing aid terms that&#39;s about the going rate for higher-end models, though the company does offer financing options too.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eargo-6-hearing-aid-030036492.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df3f6e1b-c6da-4b05-8a4c-ded3cc4d8a6d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 03:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641391031</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:57:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9d090aa0-6e2a-11ec-bbf9-833445ffdce1" width="5517" height="3706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9d090aa0-6e2a-11ec-bbf9-833445ffdce1" width="5517" height="3706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eargo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Eargo 6 hearing aides and charging case.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eargo 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro bone-conduction headphones bump up the bass]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">avid user</a> of bone-conduction headphones for years and can attest to the lackluster low-end in this form factor. Luckily, things are improving. Along with recently changing its name to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Shokz" href="https://fave.co/3FZb89e">Shokz</a> (formerly Aftershokz), the company has delivered on this long-desired feature upgrade to its line of bone-conduction headphones. The new product is called <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:OpenRun Pro" href="https://fave.co/3JUe9do">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) and there is a significant boost in bass with this Bluetooth 5.1 headset. In addition, Shokz is renaming its existing product line to tie things together with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">Aeropex</a> becoming OpenRun and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-aftershokz-xtrainerz-optishokz-revvez-bone-conduction-sunglasses.html">Xtrainerz</a> now called OpenSwim.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1cf4e2dd-7362-4a61-a99b-5930e66a9645"/><p>For those new to bone-conduction headphones, let me clarify a few things. These still don’t <em>quite</em> measure up to over-ear or in-ear models, since they have an open-ear design. The transducers rest against your cheeks in <em>front</em> of your ears and deliver sound to your inner ear via the bone. It’s a different delivery system for sound that leaves your ears open to the world, which can be a double-edged sword. They’re not great on the subway or in generally noisy environments. Don’t be disheartened, though, as this same design lets you walk, run or bike around and listen to music while still being able to hear the world around you. And with the upgrades we&#39;re seeing, the audio experience is better than ever.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, diminished low-end has long been a problem for this form factor. The OpenRun (Aeropex) have good volume levels and a decent frequency response compared to previous models. But now that I’ve tested the OpenRun pro, there’s been a noticeable improvement in the low-end spectrum. I don’t mean that they’re so loud they’re literally bouncing off your cheeks (like the old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-18-aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html">Titanium model</a> did). These deliver a good sub-frequency to give your tunes more depth without excessive tactile reverberation. My standard listening is techno and electronic music (<a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/jon-turi/jonturi-2021-series-02/">like this</a>) and it holds up pretty well. The decibel and frequency response specs are the same as before, but acoustic tweaks have born fruit. For bone conduction headphones, the OpenRun Pro sounds great.</p><p>Other desirable enhancements in this new model include the fit and charging capability. The over-the-ear curve is more rounded and the side enclosures are 20-percent smaller than before. This makes them feel light and comfortable. The battery life has been bumped up from 8 to 10 hours of listening and you can charge fully in one hour (a whole hour less than before). On top of that, we’re told you can get 1.5 hours worth of listening in five minutes of charging. A great feature when you’re settling in for a workout and hear the headset exclaim “charge me”.</p><p>If you’ve just gotten Aeropex headphones over the holidays, don’t fret. I’ve been using these for a long while and have enjoyed the experience. I even feel that while there’s not as much bass, these could be a <em>touch</em> louder in the mid to high range than the new model.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the OpenRun Pro has traded complete waterproofing for better sound. A fine mesh grate covers two vents in front of and below the cheek-based delivery system, changing it to IP55 water-resistant (still more than adequate). The OpenRun (Aeropex) retains its IP67 rating due to its sealed enclosure. If you want to wear these in the shower, then you’re in a good place (but maybe consider OpenSwim if this is a habit).</p><p>As of today, the <a href="https://shokz.com/">entire line</a> is available for purchase including the new <a href="https://shokz.com/">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) with a few new colors (although only available in black at launch).

The new headset will be compatible with the PS5 and with the new VR2 Sense controllers. It has a display resolution of 2000 x 2040 pixel per eye, has a 110-degree field of view, is capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates and supports 4K HDR.</p><p>The PS VR2 features inside-out tracking, which means it has multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. Sony has also introduced a new sensory feature for the device called &quot;headset feedback&quot; that can make games and experiences even more immersive. Headset feedback uses a built-in motor with vibrations to simulate in-game events — it can, for instance, mimic the feel of a character&#39;s elevated pulse rate while they&#39;re hiding from a threat or the feel of objects passing close to a character&#39;s head.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>3D audio and eye tracking are a couple of other features that create immersion. The headset can detect the motion of your eyes, allowing you to interact with the game environment like you&#39;d interact with the real world. As for the PS VR2 Sense controllers, they&#39;ll have key features from the DualSense controllers, particularly haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. While Sony has yet to reveal the headset&#39;s availability, the company announced one of the first games arriving on the platform. <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain, </em>a VR experience in the Horizon universe, is apparently being built for the PS VR2 and will be an exclusive title for the platform.</p><div id="ecb98f40768347fb96332f0a082201fe"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPNn-jwAC9c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4b5c898-f664-4387-8787-f19506432534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 02:31:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641349876</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
