That will make it easier to pair with and switch from Xbox One consoles to different systems including Windows 10, iOS 15 and Android devices, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-controller/">announced</a>. Microsoft has also introduced DLI (Dynamic Latency Input) to reduce console input latency on older controllers.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of Microsoft&#39;s existing Xbox One controllers, including the latest low-latency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-microsoft-xbox-series-x-controller-details.html">Xbox Series X model</a>, use Bluetooth for PCs or smartphones, and the Xbox Wireless protocol for Xbox consoles. Up to now, switching between them has been clunky, but with the new firmware, controllers will remember your phone or PC and let you quickly switch over to them from a console. To do that, you&#39;ll simply need to double tap the &quot;pair&quot; button.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another key update is DLI, designed to cut the input latency on controllers paired with the latest Xbox Series X/S consoles. The new firmware means that older controller will react as quickly as the latest models that ship with consoles, making gaming more responsive. &quot;We believe it’s important to maintain backward compatibility with Xbox accessories people already have in their collection and to ensure we deliver the best gaming experience no matter how you choose to play,&quot; the Xbox team wrote in a blog post.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft is testing this feature with Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Xbox Insiders today, but it should come to all users in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xbox-controller-update-makes-it-easier-to-pair-with-and-switch-between-devices-104553946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e7ae37cc-a785-4f98-843a-1999547cf92e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 10:45:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631184255</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T10:44:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/38657bb0-1155-11ec-beff-6c02b3bf4a49" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/38657bb0-1155-11ec-beff-6c02b3bf4a49" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox Controller update makes it easier to pair with and switch between devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox Controller update makes it easier to pair with and switch between devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon complains Elon Musk's companies don't play by the rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s response to SpaceX&#39;s FCC filing, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-amazon-fcc-delay-195245682.html">accused</a> the e-commerce giant of trying to delay proposals for its Starlink internet service on purpose, is just as <a href="http://www.reuters.com/technology/amazoncom-goes-jugular-fcc-spat-with-spacexs-musk-2021-09-08/">scathing</a>. In an <a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-471532&amp;f_number=SATAMD2021081800105">FCC filing of its own</a>, Amazon told the regulator that SpaceX chief Elon Musk tends to ignore rules and government-imposed regulations. The company also said that SpaceX often accuses any company &quot;that dares point out its flouting of laws and regulations&quot; as &quot;anticompetitive.&quot;</p><p>Part of Amazon&#39;s filing reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Try to hold a Musk-led company to flight rules? You&quot;re &quot;fundamentally broken.&quot; Try to hold a Musk-led company to health and safety rules? You&#39;re &quot;unelected &amp; ignorant.&quot; Try to hold a Musk-led company to US securities laws? You&#39;ll be called many names, some too crude to repeat...</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/amazon-slams-spacex-tells-fcc-that-musk-led-companies-are-rule-breakers/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, Amazon urged the FCC a couple of weeks ago to reject a proposal from SpaceX regarding the future of its Starlink internet service. Back then, Amazon claimed that SpaceX was proposing &quot;two mutually exclusive configurations&quot; with &quot;very different orbital parameters,&quot; which goes against regulations. SpaceX responded that it only proposed two possible configurations in case the one it actually prefers doesn&#39;t work out. The Elon Musk-led company then told the FCC that the move is &quot;only the latest in [Amazon&#39;s] continuing efforts to slow down competition.&quot;</p><p>If you&#39;ll recall, Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-lunar-lander-on-hold-blue-origin-lawsuit-120527376.html">filed a complaint</a> against NASA with the US Court of Federal Claims over the lunar lander contract it awarded to SpaceX. Blue Origin expected the space agency to award two contracts instead of just one and argued that the selection process was unfair, because it wasn&#39;t given the opportunity to revise its bid in the face of a smaller budget than expected. The litigation forced the space agency to put the $2.9 billion project on hold for the second time.&nbsp;</p><p>When Amazon asked the FCC to reject SpaceX&#39;s Starlink proposal, the latter suggested that Amazon, &quot;as it falls behind competitors ... is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving [it] even further behind.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-elon-musk-rules-are-for-other-people-fcc-filing-084518762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b67c86e-1d08-4e0d-8e25-37cbb9ea8e8e</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 08:45:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631176616</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T08:36:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/3f2af2f0-3923-11eb-bbf2-281acc991d49" width="4513" height="3180" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/3f2af2f0-3923-11eb-bbf2-281acc991d49" width="4513" height="3180" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRITTA PEDERSEN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk (R) gestures as he arrives on the red carpet for the Axel Springer Awards ceremony, in Berlin, on December 1, 2020.

Ghaleb Alaumary from Mississauga, Ontario pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit money laundering. According to the US Department of Justice, Alaumary used spoofed emails to trick a university in Canada in the first case. The emails, which looked like they were from a construction company working on a major building project for the university, asked for payment amounting to US$9.4 million.&nbsp;</p><p>After the university wired the money to accounts controlled by Alaumary and his co-conspirators, he worked with various people across the US and elsewhere to launder the funds through various financial institutions. He also had people impersonating wealthy bankers go to Texas to get personally identifiable information from victims and then use that to steal hundreds of thousands of dollars from their accounts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second case is wider in scope and involves receiving funds from cyber-heists and fraud schemes. Those funds include money from a North Korean-perpetrated cyber-heist on a Maltese bank in 2019. He also received funds stolen from banks in India and Pakistan, companies in the United States and the UK, individuals in the US and a professional soccer club in the UK. Alaumary laundered the funds he received via cash withdrawals, wire transfers and cryptocurrency purchases.</p><p>Acting US Attorney David H. Estes for the Southern District of Georgia said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This defendant served as an integral conduit in a network of cybercriminals who siphoned tens of millions of dollars from multiple entities and institutions across the globe. He laundered money for a rogue nation and some of the world’s worst cybercriminals, and he managed a team of co-conspirators who helped to line the pockets and digital wallets of thieves.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to being sentenced for more than 11 years in prison, Alaumary was also ordered to pay $30 million in restitution to victims.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-canadian-11-years-laundering-money-north-korean-hacking-group-070135000.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">096ada83-50b1-431a-84fa-ec245889edab</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 07:01:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631170943</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T07:02:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d500670-1136-11ec-bff7-062845c8587b" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d500670-1136-11ec-bff7-062845c8587b" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[akinbostanci via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3d rendering of US Dollar, Money, Stack, Finance Background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US Dollar, Money, Stack, Finance Background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Animation makes Star Trek finally feel like a lived-in universe]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains spoilers for season two, episode five of &#39;</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.&#39;</em></p><p>For a franchise that’s ostensibly about exploring, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek">Star Trek</a> has always been limited in how much of the galaxy it could actually show.

Captain Freeman hopes to attend with her senior staff, but first they have to finish delivering a Doopler delegate with an annoying tendency to duplicate when he’s upset. Because this is the <em>USS Cerritos</em>, things get out of control and he ends up overrunning the ship with clones. It’s the kind of cartoonish scenario that’s easier done in animated form, instead of having to build a phalanx of CG models to interact with live actors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cef07f40-10dc-11ec-afed-cc5a3afe27b3" alt="205: &#x000153;An Embarrassment of Dooplers&#x9d; -- Fred Tatasciore as Lieutenant Shaxs, Jerry O&#39;Connell as Commander, Dawnn Lewis as Captain Carol Freeman and Gillian Vigman as Dr. T&#39;Ana of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

If that wasn’t enough, Mariner even adds a bit of local color to a few of the locations, mentioning going on a date there once, and describing the location of a Quark’s Bar as a former empty lot where teens used to make bad choices.

It took the special editions and the prequels to add a bit of cultural texture to that galaxy far, far away. <em>The Next Generation</em> added children to the ship for a little bit of family drama, but there was still a sense that there wasn’t much beyond Starfleet. Even as newer shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Discovery</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-two-trailer-213316039.html"><em>Picard</em></a> can show more thanks to bigger budgets and better CG, everything still feels rather isolated: Picard retired to his vineyard, Riker’s family lives in a cabin in the woods and Michael Burnham ends up at an Orion work camp. Contrast that to our view of the Orion home planet in “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-tom-paris-voyager-070055176.html">We’ll Always Have Tom Paris</a>,” where we get a little tour of the city and learn some things about Tendi in the process.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/32a94160-10de-11ec-bcce-60d0e9011a31" alt="205: &#x000153;An Embarrassment of Dooplers&#x9d; -- Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler and Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

It will require companies to give government agencies detailed descriptions of the targets workers are expected to meet, along with the repercussions of missing them. If it becomes law, it would also prohibit quotas that force workers to skip safety techniques or anything that prevents them from having state-mandated meal or toilet breaks. While AB-701 covers all warehouse owners, its proponents targeted Amazon, in particular.&nbsp;</p><p>The bill&#39;s author, California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/08/1034776936/amazon-warehouse-workers-speed-quotas-california-bill">said</a> that she and the bill&#39;s other backers are &quot;absolutely targeting the practices of Amazon that are being picked up... by other retailers. Amazon drew flak after workers spoke out about the enormous productivity expectations they have to meet, forcing them to skip breaks to be able to keep up. Further, because they&#39;re expected to move as fast as the machines they&#39;re working with, repetitive strain injuries are a huge issue.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3375e47d-107c-4a50-9cec-3b7b7dbd820c"><em>Financial Times</em></a> notes, Amazon&#39;s rate of injury is more than double that of the national warehousing industry average, based on figures submitted to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Eric Frumin, director of health and safety for the Strategic Organizing Center, told the publication: &quot;If Amazon complies with the law, workers will now have an unparalleled ability to fight back against abusive workloads.&quot;</p><p>AB-701 passed despite fierce opposition from business and trade groups. Rachel Michelin, the president of the California Retailers Association, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-09-08/california-bill-ab701-passes-senate-warehouse-work-metrics-algorithims-regulation">warned</a> that consumers will pay the price if it becomes a law, as it would apparently increase manufacturing, storage and distribution costs. Meanwhile, the bill&#39;s supporters believe there&#39;s more to be done, especially since they had to remove some provisions to get those on the fence to vote for it. One of the provisions they killed would require Cal/OSHA to create a rule aiming to minimize musculoskeletal injuries among workers.</p><p>The bill is pending final approval this week in the Assembly, which is usually just a formality. After that, it&#39;s in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom, who can either sign it into law or veto it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-passes-ab-701-054011017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f0210e1-4ac7-4c34-b77a-4936fd7c2a6f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 05:40:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631166059</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T05:41:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcecee40-1129-11ec-b7b5-1ce414681bdb" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcecee40-1129-11ec-b7b5-1ce414681bdb" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chokii Ns via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Inventory.

Now with the $849 Roomba j7+, the company is ready to take on its greatest challenge yet: Pet poop. It&#39;s iRobot&#39;s first vacuum that can recognize and avoid obstacles, like cables or a pile of clothes, in real-time. And for pet owners, that could finally be reason to adopt a robot vacuum.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b06260e8-b950-4a1c-8596-6295b327203b"/><p>After all, you can&#39;t exactly trust your bot to clean up while you&#39;re away if they could run into surprises from your furry friends. That&#39;s a disaster that could lead to poop being spread around your home, not to mention gumming up your expensive bot. To alleviate that concern, iRobot is making a Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.): If your j7+ runs into poop within your first year of ownership, the company will replace your vacuum. That should go a long way towards making pet parents feel more comfortable with a Roomba. (It would be nice to see that offer extended beyond just one year, though.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the j7+ is technically the smartest Roomba yet, it&#39;s not the company&#39;s most powerful cleaner. That honor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-29-irobot-roomba-s9-bravaa-jet-m6.html">still belongs to the $1,299 s9+</a>. This new model is basically <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-05-roomba-i7-plus-review.html">the Roomba i7+</a> with a more powerful camera, better sensors and far more processing power. It can also automatically empty its bin into a redesigned Clean Base, which is shorter and sleeker than the previous models we&#39;ve seen.  Now you should be able tuck it into an inobtrusive corner, or under a table, instead of dedicating floorspace to a tall iRobot monolith.</p><p>With its &quot;PrecisionVision Navigation&quot; — iRobot&#39;s marketing term for AI-driven computer vision — the j7+ can detect specific objects, as well as alert you to obstalces in the iRobot app after a cleaning job. You can label them as permanent or temporary obstructions, which helps the vacuum learn how to deal with similar issues in the future. If there&#39;s a pile of cords that will always be in one corner, the j7+ will just stop cleaning around that area for good. But if it&#39;s just a headphone cord that you&#39;ve dropped onto the floor, the robot can give that area another go on future jobs. And since it can actually see and interpret your rooms, the j7+ will also be able to clean more gently along walls and furniture.</p><p>As it&#39;s relying on computer vision, iRobot had to train new models to help the j7+ recognize objects from floor level (there aren&#39;t too many other devices with a camera down there). At this point, CEO Colin Angle tells us that it can recognize and a pair of corded headphones on the ground, but eventually it&#39;ll handle shoes and socks as well. When it comes to recognizing pet poop, the company captured photos using playdough models, as well as images from employees, to build what&#39;s surely one of the most unique machine learning models around.</p><p>iRobot plans to bring the j7+&#39;s sensors  to future models, Angle says, but it wanted to introduce them in something more people could buy. As much as I like the pricey s9+, it&#39;s not a wise purchase when there are cheaper self-cleaning Roombas around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" style="height:1621;width:2048;" alt="iRobot Roomba j7+" data-uuid="c971680f-9456-31c2-a233-caf710a9692f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">iRobot</div></figure><p>The j7+ is powered by iRobot&#39;s new Genius 3.0 software, which will also roll out to the rest of the company&#39;s connected vacuums. That builds on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">features introduced last year</a> — which includes a better mobile app, smarter scheduling and routine triggers — by adding cleaning time estimates, as well as the ability to automatically clean while you&#39;re away. The new OS smarts will also let Roombas automatically suggest room labels as they map out your home. And if you send you intrepid bot to clean one room, it&#39;ll be able to move throughout your home quietly until it reaches the work zone.</p><p>While I haven&#39;t tried out the j7+ yet, it&#39;s clear that iRobot is targeting a persistent issue with robot vacuums: trust. Early Roombas required plenty of babysitting, otherwise they could easily get stuck or jammed. These days, I habitually clear out my floors before I start a vacuum run, because even newer models can get into trouble. If iRobot can actually develop a vacuum bot that can deal with obstacles on its own, it may finally have the ideal device for people who hate cleaning. At the very least, it&#39;d be nice to have something I can trust to avoid my cat&#39;s poop.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8ad2ea9-9482-4868-95cf-b40280d5c0fd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 04:01:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631128836</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T19:20:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a5bbd0-10d7-11ec-b6d6-cc025fdbd8b2" width="2047" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a5bbd0-10d7-11ec-b6d6-cc025fdbd8b2" width="2047" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Star Trek: Picard' takes us to an alternate reality in February 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html"><em>Picard</em></a> picked up many years after the destruction of Romulus with a much darker, more depressing Federation.

The streaming service has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SL9aJcqrtnw">posted</a> a teaser trailer for <em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em>, a satire where &quot;star-studded cast&quot; is an understatement.

The company is now starting to test <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/testing-communities">Communities</a>, “a more intimate space for conversations” on the platform.</p><p>Communities, which the company first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-test-communities-tipping-super-follows-183101868.html">teased</a> back in February, are sort of like Twitter’s version of a subreddit or a public-facing group on Facebook. Communities are dedicated to specific topics, and members can post tweets to a dedicated group timeline. Each community has its own moderators who set rules for the group, and users must be invited by an existing member or moderator to participate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature is meant to address what’s been a long-running issue for the platform: that it can be incredibly difficult for new users to wade through the noise and find the corner of Twitter that speaks to their interests. The company has tried to address this with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-twitter-topics-live.html">Topics</a>, which injects tweets into your timeline based on your interests, but Communities takes the idea a step further.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/313b9be0-10c3-11ec-9edf-1b6598f373da" alt="Communities are for more " data-uuid="c78014fd-c07e-3b9b-9d25-b64dfa907a54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Twitter notes that some of its first Communities will focus on popular topics like skincare, astrology, sneakers and dogs, but that over time it expects the groups to reflect the more “niche discussions” that happen on the platform. For now, Twitter is starting with just a handful of Communities, though moderators and members are able to invite anyone to join. The company says it plans to open up the feature for more users to create Communities in the “coming months.”</p><p>Notably, Twitter seems to be trying to avoid some of the issues that have plagued <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html">Facebook’s Groups</a>. All Communities are publicly accessible and viewable by anyone on the platform —there’s no such thing as a private or “secret” Community — though only members can participate in the discussion directly. Like Reddit and Facebook, Twitter will also rely on admins and moderators to steer the day-to-day conversations and keep members in check. The company is also working on new reporting and detection features to weed out “potentially problematic” groups that may spring up.</p><p>Though the company is calling the feature a test, Twitter seems to be quite serious about its potential. Communities is getting its own tab in the center of Twitter’s app, between explore and notifications, which suggests the company plans for Communities to be a prominent feature of its platform for the long term.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-communities-170039437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">720f6ee3-4170-41e0-b6eb-ca1fda5a5f79</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631124918</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T18:15:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91f14a10-106a-11ec-bffc-068d261ccca1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is testing communities, its new subreddit like feature for groups.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter communities]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fake pro-China accounts tried to push Americans to attend anti-racism protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, security researchers from Google and cybersecurity firm Mandiant disclosed that a network of fake pro-China social media accounts tried to mobilize Americans to attend anti-racism protests in response to the coronavirus pandemic. According to a <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2021/09/pro-prc-influence-campaign-social-media-websites-forums.html"><ins>report the two organizations published</ins></a>, the network “did not appear to achieve any success,” but in one instance it tried to push Asian-Americans to attend an April 24th protest that sought to “fight back” against claims the virus was engineered in a Chinese lab.</p><p>They did not directly attribute the campaign to the Chinese government.

At the very least, the scope of the activity is far broader than previous efforts this network has conducted.

Instead, they cast a wide net, creating accounts across more than 30 social media platforms and 40 additional websites and “niche” forums, including places like LiveJournal and Vimeo.

Firesprite, which is behind <em>The Playroom </em>and <em>The Playroom VR</em>, has become the company&#39;s 14th studio.</p><p>&quot;Firesprite is a creative and ambitious studio that is exceptional at building incredible experiences that truly showcase the potential of our hardware,&quot; PlayStation Studios chief Hermen Hulst <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/08/welcoming-firesprite-to-the-playstation-studios-family/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>. &quot;The team’s technical and creative capabilities will be paramount to growing our stellar catalogue of exclusive games, and I think you’ll be excited for what’s to come.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Several developers will be returning to Sony as part of the deal. Hulst noted that &quot;quite a few members of Firesprite,&quot; including all of the founding team, came from Wipeout developer Studio Liverpool. Sony bought that studio in 1993, when it was known as Psygnosis, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-08-23-sony-killing-liverpool-studio-psygnosis.html"><ins>shut it down in 2012</ins></a>.</p><p>Sony and Firesprite have been working together more or less since the latter was formed that same year. Firssprite teamed up with Team Asobi on <em>The Playroom</em>, a 2013 collection of augmented reality minigames designed to show off the PlayStation Camera&#39;s capabilities. Its most recent game is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-13-the-persistence.html"><em><ins>The Persistence</ins></em></a>, a survival horror title that hit consoles and PC last year after debuting on PlayStation VR.</p><p>The Firesprite team is working on <em>something</em> new, but it&#39;s not entirely clear what. Other than <em>The Playroom</em> and Vita and mobile title <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-05-run-sackboy-run-starts-an-endless-stitch-hunt-on-vita-mobile.html"><em><ins>Run Sackboy!

Given Hulst&#39;s comments and that Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr-has-a-future-144001582.html"><ins>working on a second-gen PS VR headset</ins></a>, it wouldn&#39;t be a huge surprise to learn Firesprite&#39;s next game is for that platform.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-studios-firesprite-155501578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">401fb0c8-bf0e-472d-ae01-fb89860cef54</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 15:55:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631116503</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:55:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9ab271b0-10ba-11ec-bffd-57d563ddfaf3" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9ab271b0-10ba-11ec-bffd-57d563ddfaf3" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios x Firesprite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation Studios x Firesprite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eufy’s SpaceView baby monitor is 22 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re in the market for a baby monitor, now would be a good time to snap up a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Eufy Spaceview" href="https://amzn.to/38UuQDW">Eufy Spaceview</a> set.

However, items that promote misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines are still appearing in search results on the Amazon storefront, according to Senator Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>The senator&#39;s staff found that searches for terms including “COVID-19,” “COVID,” “vaccine,” “COVID-19 vaccine” and “pandemic” led to results such as books peddling &quot;falsehoods about COVID-19 vaccines and cures,&quot; including at least one that Amazon tagged as a best seller.

She called on Jassy to, within 14 days, detail a plan to modify the algorithms so they no longer turn up products that include COVID-19 misinformation, and to release a public report on &quot;the extent to which Amazon’s algorithms are directing consumers&quot; to such items at the moment.</p><p>In addition, Warren sought clarification on Amazon&#39;s current policies about those products and what the company has done to tackle the spread of false information. She also wants to know more details about the best-seller tag, and why books containing COVID-19 misinformation are being awarded the label.</p><p>Warren acknowledged that Amazon has provided its users with resources for accurate information about COVID-19, including prominent links to the Food and Drug Administration website.

The agency now <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-readies-james-webb-space-telescope-for-december-launch">plans to launch</a> the telescope on December 18th, 2021, just a few months after testing completed in late August. The hardware will reach orbit aboard an ESA-supplied Ariane 5 rocket lifting off from French Guiana. NASA still has to ship the telescope to the launchpad, although much of the rocket has already arrived.&nbsp;</p><p>The JWST was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">deemed complete</a> in 2016 ahead of an expected 2018 launch, but faced a number of delays due to its elaborate construction. It wasn&#39;t assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">until 2019</a>, and factors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coronavirus-delays-launch-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-161528305.html">like the COVID-19 pandemic</a> further hindered NASA&#39;s efforts. That&#39;s not including earlier setbacks — development started in 1996 with an expected 2007 deployment, but the team scrapped much of its work and redesigned the equipment in 2005.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The telescope&#39;s importance hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s considered the successor to the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html"> Hubble Space Telescope</a>. It includes a much larger mirror along with a focus on lower-frequency observations (particularly mid-infrared) that will help it detect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-07-sounds-of-oldest-stars-in-milky-way-galaxy.html">early galaxies</a> that even Hubble can&#39;t find. That priority also helps explain some of its technical challenges. The JWST&#39;s instruments will need to stay extremely cold (-370F) to avoid interference with infrared measurements, requiring both a large sunshield and an insertion near a Sun-Earth Lagrange point.</p><p>The mission will be relatively short. As the JWST needs propellant to maintain orbit, it can&#39;t last indefinitely like a telescope circling Earth. NASA would consider a five-year lifespan &quot;nominal,&quot; although it&#39;s hoping for 10 years.</p><p>All the effort might just pay off. In addition to shedding more light on the early Universe, the JWST should also help astronomers and astrophysicists fill gaps in studies where Hubble wasn&#39;t enough. Infrared waves are more likely to cut through cosmic dust, and they&#39;re the primary radiation from cooler celestial bodies like brown dwarfs and planets. There&#39;s a very real chance the JWST will help solve a string of cosmic mysteries during its brief lifetime.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f8502fd-99d2-4800-b26d-9b97534e2e63</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 14:51:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631114021</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T15:13:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alex-mit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
