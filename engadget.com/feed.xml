With the release, it has now filled in the blanks for key specifications <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-confirms-development-eos-r3-mirrorless-camera-082035304.html">not yet revealed</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r3-race-car-tracking-125059799.html">earlier teases</a>, like resolution, ISO range and video capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The EOS R3 was never likely to be a high-resolution camera as some folks hoped, but the 24.1-megapixel, back-side illuminated (BSI), stacked sensor (a first for Canon) is a significant upgrade over the 1DX Mark III&#39;s 20-megapixel sensor. Canon says it &quot;achieves resolution performance exceeding that of the 30.1-megapixel EOS 5D Mark IV,&quot; despite having a lower pixel count.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the BSI/stacked sensor and latest DIGIC X image processor, the R3 can shoot at 30 fps in electronic shutter mode (down to 1/64,000th of a second) or 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, with full AF tracking and auto-exposure. Better still, it offers blackout-free shooting in electronic mode and the high readout speeds deliver minimal rolling shutter distortion — making it feasible to shoot sports or action with the electronic shutter.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3b7c97c0-146b-11ec-8f7e-91d97a29c50a" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="bf695619-0ab5-32bb-b04e-1d3309f7784c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The EOS R3 is Canon&#39;s first EOS model to support flash photography in electronic shutter mode. That allows for blackout-free flash shooting at up to 15 fps (at 1/180th of a second), which would probably look pretty wild in person. It also offers a silent shutter mode that turns off the artificial shutter and AF acquisition sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The EOS R3 has a number of new autofocus features, too. The flashiest is Eye Control AF that locks onto focus wherever your eye is looking when you half-press the shutter button. It can be used in combination with flexible zone and subject AF tracking, so it&#39;s &quot;possible to quickly shift the target between multiple subjects,&quot; Canon says. It notes that the feature can be calibrated differently if you have glasses or contacts, and that &quot;some glasses/contacts may prevent calibration.&quot;</p><p>Faster calculation speeds give the EOS R3 some new autofocus powers, too. The Dual Pixel AF system can now track in spot, single-point and flexible zone AF, and in lower light (-7.5 EV) than any other model. It can also acquire a subject just by getting close to it, so it will track an animal or human&#39;s head, face or eye if you place the AF point near their body, for example.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5bc005d0-146b-11ec-bbdd-8988aaa62391" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="5f5e7fc4-57b0-3a83-8b18-5ba0f56fb326"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>On top of body, face, head and eye detection for humans, the R3 offers a new &quot;Vehicle Priority&quot; tracking system for open cockpit, GT and rally cars, along with on-road and off-road motorcycles. If the AI detects a helmet (on a motorcycle or open cockpit car), it will automatically lock onto that.</p><p>The new sensor delivers improved low-light performance too, with the EOS R3 having a normal range of ISO 100-102,400 for stills (expandable to ISO 50-204,800). Canon also promises improved automatic and manual white balance via new AI skills.</p><p>The 5-axis in-body stabilizer is the the same as the excellent system on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">EOS R5</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">R6</a>. As with those models, it delivers up to 8 stops of stabilization with compatible lenses, down to a minimum of 6 stops (still beating most other brands) with other lenses. It also comes with dual card slots, supporting SD and CFexpress type B cards.</p><p>The R3 comes with a new 5.76 million dot, 120 FPS OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF) developed by Canon. This is a key feature for the sports photographers who might buy it, as many haven&#39;t switched to mirrorless because they prefer an optical viewfinder. Canon said it provides a level of clarity and field of view similar to an optical viewfinder &quot;thanks to the HDR technology and high brightness performance.&quot; Like the R6 and R5, it also offers a fully-articulating, 4.15 million dot flip-out touchscreen — ideal for video shooters.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/81d3cb80-146b-11ec-9f3a-21ded624b0d7" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="f7afac2a-9202-3d98-b882-c3137bc564e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>In fact, the R3 is also a highly competent video camera, too. While it can&#39;t shoot 8K video like the R5, it can capture RAW 12-bit 6K widescreen (6,000 x 3,164) video at up to 60 fps to a CFexpress B card, besting Panasonic&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-panasonic-s1h-review.html">video-centric S1H</a>. Canon has yet to say if 6K RAW over HDMI will be supported, however.</p><p>It also offers 4K recording at up to 120 fps, albeit in a cropped 1:1 pixel mode to a CFexpress card. Still, you can capture 4K 60p or 30p video using the full width of the sensor, which should make for some crisp video. Again, for the best quality, you&#39;ll need a fast SD UHS II or CFexpress card. 10-bit 4:2:2 video will be available for all 4K modes in either HDR PQ or Canon Log 3 modes, with both All-I and long-GOP file options.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual with Canon cameras, the Dual Pixel autofocus should be a strong point for video, as it can lock in to a subject quickly without any hunting. The extra tracking features should be a bonus too, but we&#39;ll need to test the R3 to verify that. As you&#39;d well expect, it has microphone, headphone and HDMI ports — though the latter is a micro and not a full-sized HDMI connector, unfortunately.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3a92430-146b-11ec-b8fd-2bea7b37f951" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="845db65c-573d-39ed-aa6d-3d24bae3f10b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>What about heating, the bugbear of the R5? Again, Canon has significantly improved the R3 here. It now offers two temperature options for auto power off: standard and high. The latter will let you shoot 6K RAW or 4K All-I at 60 fps for 60 minutes or more, though the camera might get a bit hot to the touch. 4K 120p All-I is limited to 12 minutes in either mode. Canon promises that you&#39;ll be ready to shoot again after just five minutes, though shooting times afterward will be limited in 6K 60p and 4K 120p modes. Normal 4K 30fps shooting (down-sampled or otherwise) has no heat limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include network streaming functions and wired or wireless transfer to a 5G or LTE smartphone. It uses the 1DX Mark III&#39;s LP-E19 battery that delivers 440 shots with the electronic viewfinder and comes with a new electronic hot shoe that supports more accessories, including a smartphone link adapter. Finally, the EOS R1 offers dust and drip resistance equal to the EOS-1DX series DSLRs, and weighs in at 1015 grams (2.24 pounds) including a memory card and battery.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/777df650-146c-11ec-bf0b-f66fe072cc79" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="ed241d80-ab8d-3628-8e1b-155dc7752734"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>Along with the EOS R3, Canon unveiled two new lenses, the compact RF16mm F/2.8 STM ultra wide angle model priced at $300 (left) and the RF100-400mm f/5.6-8 IS USM model priced at $650. Both of those should be decent budget full-frame RF-mount options if you&#39;re looking for an ultra wide-angle or tele zoom lens.&nbsp;</p><p>With the EOS R3, Canon has built a supercharged flagship that should appeal to both the serious photographers and videographers who have the bucks to afford one. It arrives at the end of November for $6,000 (body only).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canons-24-megapixel-eos-r-3-can-shoot-raw-photos-at-30-fps-100003365.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8277a5e4-d651-4342-831c-872dc61fca6f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 10:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631603451</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T07:11:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1b86fb90-146b-11ec-b5df-6c319d40b3a0" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1b86fb90-146b-11ec-b5df-6c319d40b3a0" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's palm-reading tech is heading to sports stadiums and music venues]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has been using its palm-scanning technology to allow customers to pay for purchases at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">Whole Foods</a> and its own cashierless stores.

The device won&#39;t only be capable of taking photos, but also of displaying messages and notifications, making calls, providing navigation and translating text right in real time in front of your eyes. Like Facebook, Xiaomi is also putting emphasis on the device&#39;s lightness despite its features. At 51 grams, though, it&#39;s a bit heavier than the social network&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a>. In addition, the glasses also has an indicator light that shows when the 5-megapixel camera is in use.</p><div id="3e6dd2c0ff254c74aa8033a15b7e647d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9bnmES7O74?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Xiaomi&#39;s Smart Glasses are powered by a quad-core ARM processor and run on Android. They also use MicroLED imaging technology, which is known for having a higher brightness and longer lifespan than OLED. The company says the technology has a simpler structure that enabled it to create a compact display with individual pixels sized at 4μm. You won&#39;t be able to view the images you take in color, though — Xiaomi says it opted to use a monochrome display solution &quot;to allow sufficient light to pass through complicated optical structures.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company explains:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The grating structure etched onto the inner surface of the lens allows light to be refracted in a unique way, directing it safely into the human eye. The refraction process involves bouncing light beams countless times, allowing the human eye to see a complete image, and greatly increasing usability while wearing. All this is done inside a single lens, instead of using complicated multiples lens systems, mirrors, or half mirrors as some other products do.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Its smart glasses won&#39;t be just a second screen for your phone, according to Xiaomi. It&#39;s independently capable of many things, such as selecting the most important notifications to show you, including smart home alarms and messages from important contacts. The device&#39;s navigation capability can display maps and directions in front of your eyes.

The company says that existing research shows that “social media is not a primary driver of harmful polarization.” But in their report, NYU’s researchers write that “research focused more narrowly on the years since 2016 suggests that widespread use of the major platforms has exacerbated partisan hatred.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make their case, the authors highlight numerous studies examining the links between polarization and social media. They also interviewed dozens of researchers, and at least one Facebook executive, Yann Le Cun, Facebook’s top AI scientist.</p><p>While the report is careful to point out that social media is not the &quot;original cause&quot; of polarization, the authors say that Facebook and others have “intensified” it. They also note that Facebook’s own attempts to reduce divisiveness, such as de-emphasizing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html"><ins>political content</ins></a> in News Feed, show the company is well aware of its role. “The introspection on polarization probably would be more productive if the company’s top executives were not publicly casting doubt on whether there is any connection between social media and political divisiveness,” the report says.</p><p>“Research shows that social media is not a primary driver of harmful polarization, but we want to help find solutions to address it,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “That is why we continually and proactively detect and remove content (like hate speech) that violates our Community Standards and we work to stop the spread of misinformation. We reduce the reach of content from Pages and Groups that repeatedly violate our policies, and connect people with trusted, credible sources for information about issues such as elections, the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.”</p><p>The report also raises the issue that these problems are difficult to address “because the companies refuse to disclose how their platforms work.” Among the researchers recommendations is that Congress force “Facebook and Google/YouTube, to share data on how algorithms rank, recommend, and remove content.” Platforms releasing the data, and independent researchers who study it, should be legally protected as part of that work, they write.</p><p>Additionally, Congress should “empower the Federal Trade Commission to draft and enforce an industry code of conduct,” and “provide research funding” for alternative business models for social media platforms. The researchers also raise several changes that Facebook and other platforms could implement directly, including adjusting their internal algorithms to further de-emphasize polarizing content, and make these changes more transparent to the public. The platforms should also “double the number of human content moderators” and make them all full employees, in order to make decisions more consistent.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/social-media-political-polarization-nyu-report-223945859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11390a81-445d-4c47-bb61-eb8622d3e148</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 22:39:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631572785</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T22:39:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/be6ce8b0-14d9-11ec-bfaf-2f7745f633a8" width="4545" height="3030" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/be6ce8b0-14d9-11ec-bfaf-2f7745f633a8" width="4545" height="3030" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2020/12/30: In this photo illustration a Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone with fireworks in the background.

The company has several models under its belt, and the current lineup spans from <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/cx-true-wireless">basic and affordable</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-review.html">premium and pricey</a>. Today, Sennheiser is introducing its latest earbuds with the CX Plus True Wireless. This newest entry offers active noise cancellation (ANC), ambient sound and the ability to customize both the on-board controls and the EQ. It also costs less than the company&#39;s previous ANC model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html">Momentum True Wireless 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The CX Plus has a similar design to the CX and CX 400BT true wireless earbuds Sennheiser currently sells. The outer touch panel is a rounded rectangle compared to the circular exterior of the Momentum buds. On-board touch controls give you everything you need to play music, take calls and use a voice assistant without reaching for your phone. As the name implies, the CX Plus has features that aren&#39;t on the CX True Wireless. That includes a Smart Pause feature, which is basically just automatic pausing when you remove an earbud from your ear, but Sennheiser has given it a fancy name. Smart Pause was previously reserved for the pricier Momentum True Wireless 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bd26e810-14c1-11ec-bfdf-38c806c18b7b" alt="Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless" data-uuid="4bf3fe9f-45c6-31eb-bf6f-2b26587dbe64"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sennheiser</div></figure><p>Another key addition for the CX Plus is ANC. The two preceding CX models only offer passive noise isolation. The CX Plus also offers ambient sound mode, or as Sennheiser calls it, Transparent Hearing. That feature was also not available on the CX series earbuds before now. Both active noise cancellation and Transparent Hearing were only on the Momentum True Wireless 2. The company&#39;s Bass Boost preset from some previous models and the IPX4 splash-proof rating from the CX True Wireless both made the leap to the CX Plus.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of sound quality, Sennheiser says the CX Plus offers &quot;audiophile technology&quot; in &quot;everyday&quot; earbuds thanks to its TrueResponse transducer. The acoustic setup was built for much more expensive earphones and designed for &quot;high-fidelity stereo sound&quot; that offers &quot;deep basses, natural mids and clear, detailed treble.&quot; The company has a solid track record when it comes to sound, but we&#39;ll still need to check those claims ourselves to make sure they hold up this time around. Sennhesier is promising up to 24 hours of total listening time: eight hours on the buds with two additional charges in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>The CX Plus will be available September 28th in black and white color options for $179.95</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sennheiser-cx-plus-true-wireless-announced-price-specs-availability-220032850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3461967-941b-4bc3-8f0f-ec6c9e8719bb</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 22:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631569523</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T21:45:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2824da40-1491-11ec-aafc-4fb1061f9a57" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2824da40-1491-11ec-aafc-4fb1061f9a57" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sennheiser]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram is internally testing a feature that'll show some people higher in its feed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is working on a tool that could give people more control over its famously obtuse feed algorithm.

The cross check program meant that if one of these accounts broke its rules, the violation was sent to a separate team so that it could be reviewed by Facebook employees, rather than its non-employee moderators who typically review rule-breaking content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook had previously disclosed the existence <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"><ins>of cross check</ins></a>, which had also been reported on by other outlets. But <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> report revealed that “most of the content flagged by the XCheck system faced no subsequent review.” This effectively allowed celebrities, politicians and other high profile users to break rules without consequences.</p><p>In one incident described in the report, Brazilian soccer star Neymar posted nude photos of a woman who had accused him of sexual assault. Such a post is a violation of Facebook’s rule around non-consensual nudity, and rule breakers are typically banned from the platform. But the cross check system “blocked Facebook’s moderators from removing the video,” and the post was viewed nearly 60 million times before it was eventually removed. His account faced no other consequences.</p><p>Last year alone, the cross check system enabled rule-breaking content to be viewed more than 16 billion times before being removed, according to internal Facebook documents cited by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The report also says Facebook ‘misled’ its Oversight Board, which pressed the company on its cross check system <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>in June</ins></a> when weighing in on how the company should handle Donald Trump’s “indefinite suspension.” The company told the board at the time that the system only affected “a small number” of its decisions and that it was “not feasible” to share more data.</p><p>“The Oversight Board has expressed on multiple occasions its concern about the lack of transparency in Facebook’s content moderation processes, especially relating to the company’s inconsistent management of high-profile accounts,” the Oversight Board said in a statement shared <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1437434013153640455"><ins>on Twitter</ins></a>. “The Board has repeatedly made recommendations that Facebook be far more transparent in general, including about its management of high-profile accounts, while ensuring that its policies treat all users fairly.”</p><p>Facebook told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that its reporting was based on “outdated information” and that the company has been trying to improve the cross check system. “In the end, at the center of this story is Facebook&#39;s own analysis that we need to improve the program,” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1437463427103002624"><ins>wrote</ins></a> in a statement. “We know our enforcement is not perfect and there are tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.”</p><p>The revelations could prompt new investigations into Facebook’s content moderation policies. Some information related to cross check has been “turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to Congress by a person seeking federal whistleblower protection,” according to <em>The Wall Street Journa</em>l.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf0a5f45-64c4-46bc-b477-04346c7df26a</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:17:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631557040</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T18:17:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/692e4680-a42f-11ea-bb5c-a249495bbdb1" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/692e4680-a42f-11ea-bb5c-a249495bbdb1" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JIM WATSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2018 in Washington, DC.

There are almost too many enhancements to count, but some of the more notable ones have the potential to change how you use the service.</p><p>The first of those is an expansion of Zoom&#39;s automated closed captioning system. At the start of the year, Zoom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-automatic-closed-captions-all-users-fall-081631869.html">announced</a>&nbsp;it was making the feature available to all of its users by the fall of 2021. Now, the company plans to make it work in a total of 30 languages. It’s also adding live translation support for 12 languages. Both expansions will occur over the next year and come after the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-kites-real-time-machine-translation-184824115.html">bought a startup</a>&nbsp;that specializes in real-time translation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoom is also working on an expanded&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whiteboard/">Whiteboard experience</a>&nbsp;that will make the feature available on the web and outside of meetings and calls. To that end, you’ll find a separate Whiteboard tab once the experience rolls out in beta later this year. Then, sometime next year, Zoom plans to work with Facebook to bring its video conferencing software and Whiteboard feature to the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>&nbsp;to allow you to access them both in virtual reality.</p><p>Zoom is also working on several smaller but still notable features. For instance, support for end-to-end encryption is coming to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/e2ee-byok-verified-identity">Zoom Phone</a>, which will allow you to keep phone calls you make over Zoom secure.

He accused Amazon of strong-arming wholesalers that provide it with products into anti-competitive agreements and making them subsidize lower prices. Engadget has contacted Amazon for comment.</p><p>The AG contends that Amazon requires a guarantee from wholesalers that it will make a minimum profit when it buys and resells their products. Those deals enable Amazon to undercut competitors&#39; pricing and force wholesalers to pay the difference for lost profit margins, according to <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/a2fdda29-9dc1-46d8-8bd9-37071ac49c7c/note/0a5b3272-9ceb-4e2d-bef2-34d06480a870.#page=1">court documents</a> obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/13/dc-attorney-general-targets-amazons-wholesale-biz-expanded-antitrust-suit/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Racine claims that Amazon&#39;s Minimum Margin Agreement (MMA) prompts wholesalers to charge more for goods elsewhere to cover those costs, making it more difficult for other e-commerce platforms to compete against Amazon&#39;s prices. The MMA leads to higher prices and less choice for consumers, according to Racine, as well as reduced levels of competition and innovation among online marketplaces.</p><p>“Amazon has continued to use its dominant position as an online marketplace to rig the system, leading to higher prices for consumers and less competition among online marketplaces,&quot; Racine told Engadget in a statement. &quot;As we further investigated Amazon’s anti-competitive practices that harm consumers and further entrench Amazon’s monopoly, we learned it was also engaging in anti-competitive agreements with first party sellers, or wholesalers – in addition to third-party sellers. I filed this antitrust lawsuit to stand up for consumers, hold Amazon accountable for its anti-competitive practices, and protect competition. We’re continuing to do just that with this amended complaint that adds more of Amazon’s misconduct.”</p><p>Others have accused Amazon of adopting such tactics. PopSockets CEO David Barnett <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anticompetitive-complaints-against-google-apple-amazon-facebook-2020-1#amazon-hosts-counterfeits-and-bullies-its-third-party-sellers-according-to-popsockets-ceo-barnett-3">previously testified</a> that Amazon demanded payment from the company to make up for lost profits after it slashed prices.</p><p>In the initial version of his suit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-lawsui-washington-dc-attorney-general-155235736.html">which was filed in May</a>, Racine claimed Amazon blocks third-party sellers from offering their wares at lower prices on other platforms. Amazon is facing antitrust scrutiny elsewhere, including from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-five-antitrust-bills-apple-google-facebook-amazon-205114170.html">House of Representatives</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-amazon-antitrust-third-party-data-114513778.html">European Commission</a>.

Yes, it&#39;s been nearly two years since then, but the AirPods Pro remain the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds</a> for those with iPhones. That&#39;s due in part to how easily they pair and switch between Apple devices thanks to the H1 chip inside the buds, a piece of tech that also enables hands-free Siri access. Connecting the AirPods Pro to your iPhone for the first time is a quick and seamless process, and after that, you can go from listening to music on your Mac to taking a call on your iPhone with little hassle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AirPods Pro also have a better fitting design than standard AirPods, although that could change if Apple announces an updated model of its standard buds tomorrow.

That may not sound like much, considering plenty of escape rooms are cheesy monuments to corporate team-building exercises and gentrification, but I mean it as a compliment. <em>Deathloop</em> uses the fundamentals of old-school locked-room mysteries to deliver a rich and stylish universe driven by intrigue, action and strategy. The main difference between <em>Deathloop</em> and an actual escape room is, well, all the death.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a fair amount of dying in <em>Deathloop</em>. Dying is a core mechanic of the game, and it’s the first thing players actually do in the campaign, called Break the Loop. The opening scene has Colt, the main character, on his back with a murderous woman called Julianna sitting on top of him, pressing a massive blade to his chest. After some banter, she plunges the knife into Colt’s heart, and he sputters and dies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d13d10-1434-11ec-bff7-06051b7056a0" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="e0984436-4fdd-3a6d-a3a1-1e024fe47e1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>And then the game begins. Colt awakens on a cold, empty beach littered with bottles, and he makes his way to a compound built into the side of the sea wall. As he walks, glowing words appear around the environment, as if a loved one is leaving words of encouragement and warning for him. Colt is confused — he doesn’t even know his own name at this point, let alone how he got here or who’s trying to talk to him.</p><p>The identity of the message-writer is just one of a dozen or so core mysteries in <em>Deathloop</em>, and these are the driving force of the campaign. Colt’s job is to explore Blackreef, the island where he’s been trapped in an infinite respawn cycle, and learn as much about its leaders and technology as possible, in order to burn it all down. Blackreef is a retrofuturistic bubble populated by residents who split their time between partying and violently defending their consequence-free way of life, and Colt can either sneak or shoot his way through their ranks.</p><p>In action, <em>Deathloop</em> feels a lot like Dishonored<em>&nbsp;</em>(of course), with a chaser of <em>We Happy Few </em>and <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>. It’s mechanically mature and narratively dense, but best of all, it doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d0eef0-1434-11ec-9cd4-676d4be2cfbb" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="cf74e826-efdd-3266-9e4e-c34d5a095237"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p><em>Deathloop</em> is one of the few first-person action games that I can successfully play in stealth mode, silently taking down enemies, hacking turrets and sniping from the rooftops in order to stay alive. Usually with games like this — I’m thinking Deus Ex and Far Cry — I intend to play stealthily, but it doesn’t work out. I get too close to an enemy, or miss my headshot, or forget about that security camera, and I end up just throwing a grenade and emptying my magazine, recklessly running into danger.</p><p><em>Deathloop</em> invites the kind of stealth that I can sustain. The environments are endlessly climbable, offering plenty of vantage points for Colt to survey and mark his enemies, tracking their movements and revealing the kinds of weapons they’re carrying. If something in <em>Deathloop</em> looks scalable, it likely is, opening up the game world in all directions. Additionally, if I accidentally alert the enemies in one location, I don’t feel like I have to abandon my plans and roll in guns blazing. Generally speaking, I can find some cover, pick off the folks that follow me, and return to the rest of the mission in stealth mode. My favorite weapons in these moments are the Tribunal and the PT-6 Spiker, both of which are silent and deliver instant-kill headshots.</p><p>I’d like to blame the success of <em>Deathloop</em>’s stealth mechanics on my own skills or the masterful sense of level design coming out of Arkane Studios, but it might just be the game’s hit-or-miss AI. There are times it feels too easy to sneak up on enemies, and moments when they fail to react appropriately to Colt’s presence, standing still for seconds too long, piling up in hallways or ignoring nearby scuffles. It’s not every encounter, and there are still plenty of moments when I’m bested by the NPCs, but it’s enough that I’d classify the enemy AI in <em>Deathloop</em> as OK, rather than good.</p><section data-eng-breakout="968d877fc48b4fb1b23afcb02afe727e" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e722df80-1434-11ec-bffd-c86b67797a0b" alt="Deathloop"></section><p>Along his way, Colt picks up a variety of weapons and ultra-high-tech artifacts that grant him special abilities and perks. There are Trinkets, which are small glowing items that enhance whatever gun they’re attached to, and Slabs, which give Colt — and his enemies — superhuman powers like invisibility, telekinesis and short-distance teleportation. Once collected, the Slabs are swappable in Colt&#39;s loadout, and they tend to be tons of fun.</p><p>Blackreef is controlled by eight Visionaries of the AEON Program, one of whom is Julianna, and the only way to escape the island is for Colt to kill them all in a single day, breaking the loop. However, it’s not as simple as speedrunning through Blackreef in order to take them all out. Colt has deep ties to the AEON Program and the Visionaries all keep their own schedules, meaning a successful assassination run will require hours of information-gathering and strategizing. And, it turns out, dying.</p><p>Once he gets going, Colt is able to die twice during any playthrough with few consequences; he’s simply transported to a previous location and allowed to keep going, health restored. On the third death, however, he’s sent back to that bottle-lined beach, resources depleted.</p><p>He also loses his gear after a full day of activity, regardless of progress. <em>Deathloop</em> is divided into four times — morning, noon, afternoon and night — and after each complete sequence, Colt is beached. Certain missions can only be completed at specific times of day, so players have to plan their attacks accordingly, either shifting time forward or simply delaying until the next loop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d8de30-1434-11ec-b6f5-92e17974b8ad" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="ee8dff1b-e694-31a1-a31b-c4a7a4e649e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Eventually, Colt gains the ability to carry some slabs, trinkets and weapons with him between loops, though he has to infuse the items he wants to keep with a resource called Residiuum. Colt can harvest Residiuum from the shiny, glitched-out objects in Blackreef, or by killing visionaries and absorbing their energy. Residiuum can then be applied to specific items in Colt&#39;s kit, holding them for good.</p><p>With all of these trinkets, slabs, weapons, Residiuum, visionaries and loops, there’s a lot to keep tabs on in <em>Deathlooop</em>. The amount of <em>stuff </em>in the game is overwhelming at times, and it’s complicated by an intense plot filled with overlapping, time-bending mysteries. Small scraps of paper and brief audio recordings often contain crucial bits of information, rewarding players who obsessively explore every bookshelf, desk and dead-end with reams of notes and leads. The game does a good job of organizing all of these details in the resource-management screen, but overall, <em>Deathloop</em> demands full and complete attention, lest you completely lose the plot.</p><p>For those who pay attention, the story and environment of Blackreef unravels beautifully, with important secrets hidden in plain view, and new parts of the world opening and closing depending on the time of day. From this perspective, the density of things to collect, use and learn in <em>Deathloop </em>makes perfect sense. This game is built on the idea of replaying the same four maps again and again — Colt needs something new to do every time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef820610-1439-11ec-b4fb-23dd125413cc" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="313780e8-54ee-3412-9f8e-83d8e58f8223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Julianna is a charming constant in <em>Deathloop</em>, generally talking shit and fleshing out the background of Blackreef. She’s also the star of the game’s second mode, Protect the Loop. Here, players are able to invade the games of friends or strangers, playing as Julianna and hunting down Colt as he tries to complete a mission. She has her own loadout, trinkets and slabs, including a masquerade ability that lets her trade appearances with allied NPCs — meaning, everyone except Colt.</p><p>Protect the Loop is marked by long periods of silence and inactivity, followed by furious gunfire and death. Colt can take any route he wants through the various maps, and Julianna has to actively hunt him down or wait for him to appear near the objective. She may be able to disguise herself, but she only has one life, while Colt has to die three times to make it final. This results in a delicious cat-and-mouse game that’s different with each new player.</p><p>That said, Protect the Loop is also where I’ve encountered the most technical issues. I played on PS5, and one round crashed fully right after launching, while two more were completely unplayable from my end, repeatedly setting my Julianna back a few frames until Colt finally showed up and shot her. That’s in comparison with four glitch-free rounds. My recommendation here is to use an ethernet cable, rather than Wi-Fi, and make sure your friends do, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cb4015996930402d9c4ab7abb95233e6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef8d29a0-1439-11ec-8af7-a33e54a825d6" alt="Deathloop"></section><p><em>Deathloop</em> is incredibly dense, but it’s also inherently forgiving. Relying on death as a mechanic in Break the Loop takes the sting out of failing a cycle or two, since retrying is built into the narrative. Colt uncovers helpful information in most of his runs, even when he ends up dead — like, <em>dead</em> dead — and it feels like there’s always something new to uncover in Blackreef, no matter how many times he returns to the same location. If it does ever get old, there’s always the option to Protect the Loop.</p><p>And then Break the Loop. And then Protect the Loop. And then Break the Loop.</p><p>You get the idea.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7b92d17-9157-482a-950e-51626057c3ea</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:01:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631526903</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T09:55:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bethesda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo significantly cuts Switch price in Europe]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has officially lowered the suggested retail price of the base Switch model in Europe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/nintendo_switch_base_model_price_officially_reduced_to_p259e269_across_europe"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> has reported, hopefully telegraphing a similar drop in the US.

After carefully weighing up a variety of factors, including currency exchange rates in Europe and the upcoming launch of Nintendo Switch - OLED Model, we decided that now was the appropriate time to change the European trade price of Nintendo Switch.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A US price drop for the base unit has been <a href="https://screenrant.com/nintendo-switch-price-drop-rumor-leak-250/">rumored</a> with the OLED Switch set to arrive on October 8th. The new model has a larger 7-inch, 720p OLED display with smaller bezels, a new kickstand, an ethernet port and speaker improvements, though no other upgraded parts. With everything else unchanged, the lower pricing makes the base model a relatively good deal.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We made the price change before the launch of Nintendo Switch - OLED Model so that the price differences between each model in Nintendo&#39;s own retail channel, My Nintendo Store, would be what Nintendo judges to be appropriate for its own store,&quot; Nintendo said.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch base model is still showing at $300 in the US at Amazon and Nintendo&#39;s official store, so hopefully that will change in the near future.

It’s hard to describe either side as an out-and-out loser or winner;  Apple must allow App Store developers to direct users to other payment systems, which would let them bypass the 30 percent cut of in-app payments that Apple takes.

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#39;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p><p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &quot;high delta-V&quot; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#39;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p><p>While the request didn&#39;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#39;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#39;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/defense-department-nuclear-spacecraft-propulsion-211213947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20e61779-f603-4b41-8a82-24af2a98d4a2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 21:12:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631535881</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T12:24:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic appeals ruling in lawsuit against Apple over App Store rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">scored a notable victory</a> in its lawsuit against Apple, but it&#39;s dissatisfied enough to keep the legal battle going. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle">reports</a> Epic has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal">filed an appeal</a> against the ruling. The initial notice didn&#39;t explain how the <em>Fortnite</em> developer was challenging the decision, but there were a number of areas that left the company unhappy.</p><p>Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers&#39; ruling determined Epic had to pay $3.65 million in damages for violating Apple&#39;s rules barring third-party in-app payment systems, plus 30 percent of whatever Epic earned through its in-house payment system from November 2020 onward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More importantly, Rogers found Epic&#39;s monopoly allegations didn&#39;t hold up under scrutiny. While Epic did succeed in forcing Apple to allow links to third-party purchasing systems, it didn&#39;t receive concessions on allowing third-party app stores or obtaining &quot;fair competition&quot; for in-app purchasing. Apple largely gets to preserve its existing business model, preventing access to the Epic Games Store or similar App Store alternatives.</p><p>Apple isn&#39;t completely satisfied, either, and is expected to appeal Epic&#39;s one win in the case.  This fight isn&#39;t likely to end any time soon, regardless of how courts rule in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epic-appeals-apple-lawsuit-ruiling-193324451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5546d078-8d25-4222-9918-e3387106515a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 19:33:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631475207</ingested><modified>2021-09-12T19:33:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/75b67c30-13fd-11ec-bbfe-8a08e5d23974" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/75b67c30-13fd-11ec-bbfe-8a08e5d23974" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Epic Games logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on May 3, 2021.

As the company often releases polished public releases at the same time as AOSP, that hints <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel owners</a> may get their upgrade starting that day.</p><p>If the timing holds up, this also sets expectations for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> launch. Google can&#39;t really ship its new range-topping phones without Android 12, so it&#39;s unlikely to formally debut the Pixel 6 before that date. We wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the hardware only surfaced sometime later in October.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Be prepared to wait if you aren&#39;t using a Pixel.

As much as Google has done to shorten update delays with efforts like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-12-google-eliminates-android-update-roadblock-with-new-framework.html">Project Treble</a>, it still takes time for companies to both adapt Android to heavily-customized interfaces and test the software with customers and carriers.</p><div id="527dc6ad190945cdb0c24eaa5bf5b180"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Android 12 stable update may be released on October 4, as that&#39;s when Google plans to release to AOSP.
