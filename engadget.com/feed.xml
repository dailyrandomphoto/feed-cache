It&#39;s the company&#39;s first large-scale expansion, after promising <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-foxcoon-scooter-expansion-132555775.html">earlier this year</a> to bring its scooters and tech outside of Taiwan.</p><p>In May, the company <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/18/gogoro-expansion-grows-with-major-deal-to-build-battery-swap-stations-and-e-scooters-for-china/">announced</a> a partnership with China&#39;s Yadea, the largest electric two-wheel manufacturer in the world, and DJC, another Chinese scooter giant. &quot;Today’s launch in China, the world’s largest two-wheel market with more than 300 million riders, is a key milestone for all cities,&quot;  said Gogoro founder and CEO, Horace Luke.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yesterday, both companies unveiled electric scooters designed to work with Gogoro&#39;s hot-swappable batteries, branded &quot;Huan Huan&quot; in China. Yadea announced two vehicles that will be &quot;part of a larger portfolio of Gogoro-powered vehicles, while DJC took the wraps off its own prototype, Gogoro-powered scooter.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/05571ad0-2a69-11ec-bffb-5b7740a3df38" style="height:1326;width:1981;" alt="Gogoro launches its battery-swapping tech in China" data-uuid="5568ee21-5270-3501-b330-d11c35b06f97"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Gogoro</div></figure><p>Gogoro is the largest scooter company in Taiwan, but is best known for its unique swappable battery tech that lets users avoid the usual wait for a charge. The system allows users to buy scooters without a battery, making the initial purchase cheaper. Users then &quot;rent&quot; batteries via a subscription and are charged per Ah of electricity used. When their battery gets low, they can head to a &quot;GoStation&quot; and swap for a freshly charged one in as little as six seconds. The company uses cloud tech to ensure users can find batteries easily and that they don&#39;t overload energy grids.</p><p>The scooters come at a good time in China, which enacted legislation to retire up to 250 million gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. The launch could also act as a test of Gogoro&#39;s battery swapping tech for future expansions around the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06c785d3-4184-4df3-9052-d68b0a16ec6d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:03:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633939443</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T08:04:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93c1a380-2a64-11ec-bdff-d3bb45ecbb6a" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93c1a380-2a64-11ec-bdff-d3bb45ecbb6a" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gogoro]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gogoro battery-swapping expansion to China]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Gogoro battery-swapping expansion to China]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will encourage teens to 'take a break']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is trying to mend its reputation in the wake of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whisleblower Frances Haugen&#39;s testimony</a>, and that includes promises of features lessening the potential harm for teens. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"><em>CNN</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-will-try-nudge-teens-away-harmful-content-2021-10-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a> report that Facebook Global Affairs VP Nick Clegg promised Instagram would introduce a &quot;take a break&quot; feature that encouraged teens to simply stop using the social network for a while. Clegg didn&#39;t say when it would be ready, but this was clearly meant to reduce addiction and other unhealthy behavior.</p><p>The social media exec also said Facebook would &quot;nudge&quot; teens away from material in its apps that &quot;may not be conducive to their well-being.&quot; He didn&#39;t provide specifics for this new approach. He did, however, suggest that Facebook&#39;s algorithms should be &quot;held to account,&quot; including by regulation if needed, to be sure real-world results matched intentions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new methods might address some of Haugen&#39;s concerns. She claimed Facebook was aware its algorithms were destructive, leading children to harmful material and removing only a fraction of hate speech. Haugen also felt Congress should reform the Communications Decency Act&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-s230-repeal.html">Section 230</a> to increase Facebook&#39;s liability for algorithm-chosen content, and that Facebook should add friction to reduce the virality of content and force users to think about posts rather than share them reflexively.</p><p>At the same time, this might not satisfy Haugen and fellow critics. Breaks and nudges may reduce exposure to harmful content, but they won&#39;t remove the content in question. Clegg&#39;s statements also reflect a familiar strategy at Facebook. It likes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-11-facebook-says-it-needs-more-regulation-not-a-breakup.html">invite regulation</a>, but only the regulation it&#39;s comfortable with. While the proposed changes could help, politicians may demand more — in part to prevent Facebook from dictating its own regulation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-take-a-break-205617444.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50051b60-2318-4246-a5e2-19708efe493c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 20:56:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633899381</ingested><modified>2021-10-10T20:56:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/52fc75d0-a26e-11e9-bff3-c16845324959" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/52fc75d0-a26e-11e9-bff3-c16845324959" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[rilueda via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Teenage girl texting on the phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Teenage girl texting on the phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Pixel Pass' might be Google's answer to the Apple One bundle]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> might be notable for how you buy it, not just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-five-years-android-updates-134435892.html">what it offers</a>.

The <em>AP</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/dubai-middle-east-united-arab-emirates-eb2461eda153f3bc6ec281e7d1039db9">reports</a> FaceTime calls were suddenly working in the UAE as of October 10th, letting those with the app (not available on Apple gear sold in the UAE) make high-quality video and voice calls. The feature worked when speaking to people both inside and outside of the country.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain if this is a permanent or intentional change. Dubai kicked off Expo 2020 (yes, the city knows it&#39;s 2021) on October 1st, and will keep it running until the end of March 2022 — a gesture like this could encourage visitors who want to keep in touch and show what they&#39;ve seen.

Some have suspected it was a simple effort to protect state-run telecoms&#39; profits, particularly in early years when FaceTime would have consumed a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth. Others, meanwhile, have suspected security concerns. The UAE is believed to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-30-uae-surveillance-iphone-hacking.html">hacked dissidents&#39; iPhones</a> to spy on their activities, and live video chats might make that surveillance difficult.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on this reprieve lasting long as a result.

It&#39;ll help you keep track of your baby&#39;s heart rate, blood oxygen levels and hours slept, with warnings if there&#39;s an unusual spike. While the sock won&#39;t fully replace in-person checks, it could set your mind at ease and let you focus on those moments when you&#39;re truly needed. The third-generation footwear provides quicker, more accurate readings as well as considerably easier charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that said, there are no guarantees of a flawless experience. We found the Smart Sock 3 didn&#39;t fit quite as well as its predecessor and was more prone to disconnection alerts. Your circumstances may vary, but don&#39;t be surprised if you get the occasional false alarm. And babies will be babies — there&#39;s the chance your young one will kick the sensor off in the middle of the night.

TSMC would have majority control, according to the insiders, but the plant would operate on Sony land near that company&#39;s image sensor factory. The Japanese government would reportedly cover up to half of the $7 billion investment.</p><p>The plant would provide chips for cameras, cars and other purposes. Accordingly, car parts giant Denso is supposedly interested in the project. If the project moves forward, the factory would be up and running by 2024. Sony and TSMC have declined to comment, although TSMC previously said it was &quot;actively reviewing&quot; plans for an effort like this.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A joint plant wouldn&#39;t be surprising.

This would help Sony, TSMC and the larger Japanese tech industry bounce back from the shortage, not to mention add greater stability. It could also serve as a hedge — Japan, Sony and TSMC wouldn&#39;t have to worry about China-US tensions threatening production in Taiwan.</p><p>The factory might be ready at just the right time.

The 120Hz refresh rate is a major improvement and she says you won’t want to revert back to 60Hz even if it helps save a bit of battery life. She also appreciated the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Slim Pen 2" href="https://fave.co/3hZdvPr">Slim Pen 2</a>, which has a haptic motor that made it fun to use. However, she admits that the higher price point makes the Surface Pro 8 even more of a niche item.</p><h2>The Surface Go 3 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-review-130025822.html">still isn’t powerful enough</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4ea60e80-286b-11ec-a4ee-30d98f2cf213" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="f9fa1122-790c-370f-96ed-0bd2657c258b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham likes many of the features of the<a href="https://fave.co/2YrJdOv"> Surface Go 3</a>: it’s well-built, has a lovely and responsive touchscreen, a strong kickstand and is extremely light and portable. However, like the Surface Pro 8, it doesn’t come with a keyboard and you’ll definitely need one as Windows 11 still doesn’t offer up a stellar tablet experience. The bigger issue for him was the underpowered specs and average battery life. The model he reviewed came with a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p><p>That makes for a mostly capable machine for basic tasks, but Nathan experienced occasional music stutters and had to reload tabs during his workday. He noticed lag while working in Adobe Lightroom, and had issues during video calls while jumping into other programs. During his normal work routine, the battery lasted five hours, which detracts from the device’s portability. However, he liked the 10.5-inch, 1,920 x 1,280 touchscreen and the 3:2 aspect ratio as well as the infinitely adjustable kickstand. While Nathan says he can see the Surface Go 3 working as a secondary machine for travel, it’s hard to recommend as a daily driver because of its performance and battery life issues.</p><h2>The Surface Laptop Studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-studio-review-better-surface-book-130019425.html">could use more cores</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4aa466f0-286c-11ec-9fff-f65cace9fa40" alt="Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="9862263e-101e-382c-aae3-19d69e443753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the first Windows 11 PCs, the <a href="https://fave.co/3FhRGVg">Surface Laptop Studio</a> has a 14.4-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate and weighs around four pounds. Devindra Hardawar says while it’s clearly not trying to be an ultraportable, it is ultra-adjustable thanks to the display that tilts it into various angles. The display itself entranced him with its flexible hinge, fantastic Dolby Vision support and refresh rate, though it is surrounded by chunkier bezels. He said the speakers are surprisingly powerful thanks to the two subwoofers on the sides and the tweeters blasting through the keyboard.</p><p>While Devindra found the Laptop Studio to be a solid performer for everyday computing tasks — and fast enough to play <em>Overwatch</em> at 90 and 100fps — it has only a quad-core chip, and that makes it hard to recommend when so many similar machines feature more powerful six- or eight-core CPUs. He was also annoyed by the anemic port situation: two USB-C ports, which support ThunderBolt 4, and a proprietary Surface Connect slot, but there’s no longer an SD card slot, which would have been an opportunity to outdo the competition. At least Microsoft included the excellent keyboard from the Book 3 and the new Surface Slim Pen 2. While Devindra genuinely liked using the Surface Laptop Studio, he said he still wanted more power overall.</p><h2>Windows 11 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">polished and secure — but frustrating</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13245fe0-286d-11ec-bfda-764440259319" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Windows 11" data-uuid="d86ca40d-7507-32c4-9347-3ffa3b42dfee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar doesn’t think that Microsoft is trying to fix much with Windows 11. Although the new operating system is more of a coat of paint over Windows 10, he doesn’t feel that’s a problem. Devindra says the more he uses the OS, the easier it is to see how far the small design tweaks have taken the software. The taskbar now has centered icons, the Start menu has a redesigned look with pinned apps, windows have rounded corners and the icons, Explorer and Settings apps look sharp making for a more refined feel overall.</p><p>The system requirements are a bit more rigid: compatible Intel, AMD or Qualcomm processor, 4GB RAM, at least 64GB storage and you’ll have to enable Secure Boot and Trust Platform Module 2.0 which make it harder for spyware and malware to attack. This means there are some additional complications if you’ve got older hardware or if you’ve built your own PC. Windows 11 will also be the only way to use Microsoft’s DirectStorage technology, which Devindra says should dramatically speed up load times when it’s available. He says that the combination of a refreshed look, additional security and faster performance is a step forward — just not a momentous one.</p><h2>The 2021 iPad is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">an incremental update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75ca8b70-286c-11ec-baff-1457a41f10fa" alt="Apple iPad 2021" data-uuid="873f6c01-1868-3129-a513-aabc5ad3c062"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/3iM9nm2">2021 refreshed iPad</a> isn’t for early adopters like Nathan Ingraham. The updated tablet now includes a 12-megapixel front camera with Center Stage support, double the base amount of storage, the new A13 Bionic chip and iPad OS 15. However, the hardware is largely unchanged from the previous two versions. It has basically the same size and weight and still includes a 10.2-inch, 2,160 x 1,620 touchscreen, an 8-megapixel rear camera and a Lightning port for charging.</p><p>That means that this is an iPad meant for those who want a tablet that’s fast, lightweight, easy to carry around and (relatively) cheap. For most standard iPad users — those who use a tablet primarily for things like playing games or browsing the web — the new chipset will provide more than enough power. Nathan didn’t notice any slowdowns while multitasking with several open apps, though he did notice that some apps needed to refresh more frequently during those periods. Also, while the screen was serviceable for watching videos and playing games, it can’t compare to the screens on the other iPads in the lineup. But for $330, as Nathan says, who cares? If your iPad is more than a few years old, you&#39;ll find some significant improvements in this one.</p><h2>The Fitbit Charge 5 has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html">slick full-color display</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9af3ca10-286c-11ec-bf7d-e5cc1c8b2f03" alt="Fitbit Charge 5" data-uuid="8ce5c1b6-c6cb-32ec-aa63-3aa4fd799cda"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino/Engadget</div></figure><p>Though the first thing you’ll notice about the new <a href="https://amzn.to/2WYwK4m">Fitbit Charge 5</a> is the 1.04-inch color AMOLED touchscreen. Valentina Palladino says that the changes made to the wearable — rounded edges and a 10-percent thinner body — made it more comfortable to wear as well. The fitness band also now has some more advanced features like ECG measurements and EDA monitoring for stress levels. The ECG measuring is coming soon and Valentina said that the EDA monitoring wasn’t intuitive and left her frustrated. She had better luck with the built-in GPS, which immediately picked up her location and accurately mapped her running route.</p><p>Valentina also liked the alarm and timer apps, which she found helpful throughout the day. However, she was disappointed that Fitbit removed some of the music-focused features, which meant she had to pull out her phone to skip a track or control playback. She was also a bit irked to see that some of the Charge 5’s more advanced metrics, like select sleep and exercise data, were part of Fitbit’s subscription service that costs $10 per month. But she did applaud the battery life and the inclusion of Fitbit Pay with NFC. She says if what you’re looking for is a low-profile wearable with a focus on fitness and a multi-day battery life, then the Charge 5 will fit the bill.</p><h2>The updated Sonos Beam has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html">immersive Dolby Atmos sound</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c71a6ea0-286c-11ec-b6ff-879f089ddfc3" alt="Sonos Beam Gen 2" data-uuid="3fac218a-62e0-3cb3-8868-75b9b57a9ae7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says there was plenty to like about the first-gen Sonos Beam. When it comes to the <a href="https://fave.co/3Dot5MJ">Beam Gen 2</a>, he says the addition of Dolby Atmos means the device can deliver a wider, more immersive soundscape. With largely the same hardware — a center tweeter, four mid-woofers and three passive radiators — this soundbar relies on more processing power to simulate the Dolby Atmos experience. Devindra says it worked surprisingly well during his testing, but wasn’t a replacement for having actual speakers dedicated to blasting height channels.</p><p>He liked that the Beam Gen 2 was still surprisingly compact at 25.6 inches wide and weighing six pounds, and that it has the same Ethernet, HDMI and power ports on the rear. And he appreciated how easy the set up was via Sonos’s app. In testing, the new Beam excelled during action movies: while watching <em>Baby Driver, </em>Devindra said it was a richer experience and even the dialog sounded clearer, too. However, music playback wasn’t as dramatically different and Dolby Atmos support for Amazon Music will come later this year. Sonos also makes it easy to synchronize audio throughout your home and the Alexa integration works well. Devindra says it’s a solid sub-$500 soundbar to take your movie-watching up a notch.</p><h2>The Uno Synth Pro can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uno-synth-pro-review-ik-multimedia-shows-its-serious-about-hardware-120008688.html">produce glorious sounds</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e92703f0-286c-11ec-ac9f-494818b47de2" alt="Uno Synth Pro" data-uuid="06734cf2-7839-34dc-82ce-ccbf55520830"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>With three oscillators, two envelopes, two LFOs, two filters, an analog overdrive and twelve digital effects, the <a href="https://fave.co/3BXOAmF">Uno Synth Pro</a> offers plenty of options for sound design. Terrence O’Brien tested the smaller $400 Desktop model, which features a set of touch keys and an all-plastic body (the synth also comes in a standard $650 Pro model with a 37-key Fatar keybed and a partially metal chassis). He said that the overall construction feels solid enough, the buttons are decent, the knobs offer good resistance and the screen, while small, provides all the information you need.</p><p>However, the gray, black and red color scheme made it difficult to quickly spot the controls, especially in darker environments. He also didn’t like the four top knobs that change all the parameters. But Terrence said his biggest issue was with the touch keys and strips — they felt unresponsive and would occasionally fail to detect touches, which was worse in three-voice paraphone mode. The pitch and mod strips behaved similarly. But his frustrations were largely forgotten once the synth started making noise: Terrence said the oscillators have body and grit and the saw wave just rips. Overall, he was impressed enough with the wealth of sound design tools and the quality of the oscillators and filters to call himself a convert.</p><h2>Owlet’s Smart Sock Plus can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/owlet-smart-sock-plus-review-130525360.html">keep monitoring older kids</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3c986790-286d-11ec-bffd-b624ae98f5a6" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus" data-uuid="115f4cc6-fb5b-3320-ab0a-94a79692406b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>After using both the second- and third-generation Smart Socks on my twins, I’d grown accustomed to being able to check in on their stats anytime from my phone. When they aged out of their socks, it was an uncomfortable transition — for me. Owlet says I’m not alone: 72 percent of the users they polled indicated they’d like to keep using the device to measure their children’s heart rate and pulse ox levels. In response the company updated its algorithm and made the <a href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Smart Sock Plus</a>, which can accommodate children up to five years old or 55 pounds.</p><p>Aside from the larger sock and better algorithm, the Smart Sock Plus is much the same as the standard, third-gen device. In testing, the Plus seemed to fit better but I had to employ work-arounds to keep my kids from taking them off. I also noticed fewer alerts about a misaligned sock, which was a welcome update. At $359 the Smart Sock Plus is pretty pricey for new users, but the <a href="https://fave.co/3kOe1ld">$69 expansion pack</a> available for existing customers is likely to do well as it extends the life time of the sock considerably.</p><h2>The Nintendo Switch OLED edition is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-review-130025998.html">nice, but not necessary</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/683e4360-286d-11ec-b7ef-dae243876eb6" alt="Nintendo Switch OLED" data-uuid="893aa67c-5edb-3872-a6f8-bd413dfd716a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus/Engadget</div></figure><p>Kris Naudus is plain: the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/3FoGKVX">Nintendo Switch OLED</a>, while lovely, isn’t a must-have. Though the refreshed handheld system features a brighter, 7-inch OLED screen, a new stand ideal for tabletop mode, an Ethernet port and a new coating which feels good in hand, not much has changed under the hood. The CPU and GPU remain the same, ensuring the future game titles will be compatible with existing Switch and Switch Light devices, and the infamous Joy-Cons haven’t been redesigned (though hopefully the drift issues have been solved).</p><p>Kris was impressed by the new stand, which is a Surface-style panel that stretches the length of the entire unit and can be left in any angle you prefer. However, because the USB-C port is still on the bottom which means it can’t be charged while set in tabletop mode. She also liked the slimmer bezels and coating on the frame and said the new buttons look sleeker and feel better. It’s the same height and width as the original Switch, too, so it will fit with all existing accessories. And though the battery is the same, it appears to be more power-efficient thanks to the new OLED screen. Despite that, Kris says unless you’ve given up your original or really need the OLED screen, you’ll be fine sticking with your current system.</p><h2>The Carol smart exercise bike is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carol-rehiit-smart-exercise-bike-142103038.html">for big pocketbooks</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Image of the CAROL REHIIT Smart Bike." data-uuid="886b3efd-bd45-333e-b035-a17e441db8b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Daniel Cooper would tell you that he enjoyed his time with the pricey <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Carol smart exercise bike" href="https://fave.co/3mzUvZl">Carol smart exercise bike</a>, a machine intended to be used in short workouts of eight minutes and 40 seconds. Using the methods employed by Reduced Exertion, High Intensity Interval Training (REHIIT), the bike features exercise videos that you can follow via the 10.1-inch color touchscreen if you subscribe to the company’s service. Because the screen is a Lenovo tablet, you can run third-party apps through it like Peloton’s so you could take classes from there, to. Daniel says the Carol app is clean and colorful: the UI flashes when you hit a high intensity phase and power output visualizations were particularly great.</p><p>The bike itself looks like any at-home exercise bike with a large, real-slung flywheel and a drive unit to house the system to electronically control the resistance. The short handles contain heart rate-monitoring electrodes and the height of the handlebars and seat height and distance are all adjustable. After spending time with it, Daniel admits he feels like his fitness and mood both improved, but the $2,400 price tag is especially hard to swallow.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-microsofts-new-surface-devices-160051290.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96d5919d-183e-461c-b33d-a73d604ee5f0</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 16:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633725557</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T20:39:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8cc17e1-2574-11ec-9deb-e92802e50499" width="2000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8cc17e1-2574-11ec-9deb-e92802e50499" width="2000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Perserverance rover pinpoints its best chances of finding ancient Mars life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA landed the Perseverance rover in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mars-perseverance-rover-sample-water-presence-173031732.html">Mars&#39; Jezero Crater</a> knowing it had the potential for signs of ancient life, but now it&#39;s clearer where the rover should be looking.

Since the opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway in 1940, have proven vital to the region but their construction has not come without significant social costs — neighborhoods razed, residents displaced, entire communities cleaved in twain by the sprawling transportation infrastructure. In his latest book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0937GP617/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><em>Freewaytopia: How Freeways Shaped Los Angeles</em></a><em>, </em>author Paul Haddad takes readers on a whirlwind tour through the history and lore of Los Angeles&#39; sprawling highway system. In the excerpt below, we take a look at the 110 Harbor Freeway where the first live traffic updates via helicopter took place.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1dfd0ff0-2617-11ec-adef-f5945614de49" alt="Freewaytopia cover" data-uuid="be8ca971-0806-3545-b2d0-54dc00ac59e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Santa Monica Press</div></figure><p>©2021 Santa Monica Press</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Over the next four years, the Harbor Freeway began to coalesce. Press alerts went out with each new off-ramp as they came online: Olympic. Washington. Slauson. Almost all were accompanied by the kind of theatricality that defined the era. One of the dedications featured a shapely model named Ann Bradford, who wore a sash emblazoned with the words “Miss Freeway Link”—certainly one of the clunkier female honorifics dreamed up by a Chamber of Commerce. Even the freeway’s old nemesis, Kenneth Hahn, couldn’t resist attending the 124th Street opening. At the ribbon-cutting on September 25, 1958, Hahn boasted that the freeway—now stretching ten miles—was already L.A.’s second-busiest after the Hollywood Freeway. When it’s completed, he said, it will carry more traffic than “any street, highway, or freeway in the world.”</p><p>The Harbor Freeway’s immense popularity—even in unfinished form—did come with some growing pains for motorists. The Downtown section proved to be a confusing lattice of bridges and ramps that required quick lane changes and sudden start-stops. As anyone who has merged from the Hollywood Freeway onto the southbound Harbor Freeway can attest, the maneuver requires a “Frogger”-like thread of the needle through three lanes of traffic within a quarter of a mile, lest you find yourself involuntarily exiting one of the Downtown ramps. The nerve-racking exercise is compounded by incoming motorists from the Arroyo Seco crossing the same three lanes from the other direction—left to right—who are seeking the very exits you’re trying to avoid.</p><p>Pulling off either move is nothing less than a navigational baptism for newbie drivers. Some drivers can’t pull it off at all. Such was the case for Greg Morton, a thirty-four-year-old management consultant whose ordeal made him briefly famous. In March of 1958, just south of the Four Level, Morton attempted to weave to the right from the fast lane. Suddenly, a car veered into his lane and Morton panicked. He wedged the wheel leftward and found himself marooned on the center median, which, in those days, was simply a raised concrete strip with planters spaced every twenty feet. These planters posed a problem for Morton. He didn’t feel he could get a “running start” to rejoin the stream of whizzing cars. So, he waited for a break in traffic. And waited. And waited. As he was stranded, he tried to flag down eighteen passing police vehicles for help. Only one stopped. “You got yourself up there, didn’t you?” the officer chided. “Just start your engine and drive off.” Which is exactly what the cop did.</p><p>Things got so bad, Morton finally said to hell with it. He took a beach towel out of his trunk and started to sunbathe right there on the median. Perhaps this odd spectacle is what finally made a Good Samaritan assist this clearly delirious individual. The stranger was a civilian on a motorcycle who promised to make a call from a phone booth for help. Sure enough, a sympathetic officer arrived within minutes and stopped traffic long enough for Morton to escape the median. All told, the Highland Park resident had been stranded for an hour and fifteen minutes.</p><p>When asked about it later, Morton was shaken but took it all in stride. “I’d have given twenty bucks if, as there should be, there’d been a telephone out there I could’ve used to summon help,” he said.</p><p>Perhaps Kenneth Hahn was listening. Four years later, Hahn—by then a county supervisor—was the driving force behind the installation of roadside call boxes. Hahn posed for a photo at one, placing an emergency call. It was on the Harbor Freeway.</p><p>While call boxes would have to wait a few more years, 1958 did see the first routine traffic reports from helicopters. Prior to this, freeway conditions were conducted by roving cars or sporadic airplane flights. Radio station KABC was first out of the gate with <em>Operation Airwatch</em>. Every weekday morning and afternoon, traffic jockey Donn Reed delivered rush-hour updates from the cockpit of a Bell whirlybird. It was an instant hit with motorists, and Reed had proof. One morning, he asked any drivers who saw his copter to flash their headlights. Six out of ten cars did.</p><p>The fact that so many commuters tuned in may have saved the life of a three-year-old girl toddling through traffic on the Harbor Freeway. Reed got his studio to cut into programming so he could warn drivers about her presence. As cars slowed and paused, she wandered off the thoroughfare, no worse for the wear.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the Harbor Freeway saw the bulk of traffic updates. By 1958, more than 318,000 vehicles per day were passing through The Stack. That same year, the Dodgers kicked off their inaugural season in Los Angeles after relocating from Brooklyn. Home games were played at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the team awaited their permanent field in Chavez Ravine. Built for the 1932 Olympics, the Coliseum’s football-length field was not designed for baseball, just as its dense Exposition Park neighborhood was not suited for battalions of cars jamming its streets from spring until fall. Parking lots around the Coliseum could accommodate only 3,400 vehicles, forcing most motorists to pay to park on people’s lawns or find street parking. One fan from Phoenix who flew in to catch the game had to walk twenty-four blocks afterward to find a taxi to his hotel—a longer journey than his plane ride.</p><p>Crushing traffic around the Coliseum backed up on the Harbor Freeway for a mile or more in each direction. The delays led to a Dodger fan stereotype that persists to this day: “Fans have been arriving as late as the third inning,” pointed out sportswriter Rob Shafer of the <em>Pasadena Star-News</em>. Mostly, though, Angelenos were so enamored by their Boys in Blue, any inconveniences were met with wry wit. “The one thing the Dodgers forgot to bring with them when they moved to Los Angeles was the New York subway,” quipped one newspaper. When Liberace had the gall to perform at the neighboring Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena during a Dodger game, Rob Shafer swore that traffic on the Harbor Freeway created “some kind of human record for collective blood pressure.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-freewaytopia-paul-haddad-santa-monica-press-153036975.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f65f4dd9-e32d-4539-a370-547dde69e96f</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 15:30:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633538620</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T16:43:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/09763fc0-2626-11ec-a3ff-5e7a938b5d9e" width="5400" height="3587" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/09763fc0-2626-11ec-a3ff-5e7a938b5d9e" width="5400" height="3587" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Proehl via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Los Angeles Freeway at the intersection of Interstate 110 & 105.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Los Angeles Freeway]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recommended Reading: Restaurants vs. food delivery apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/q-and-a/the-fight-to-rein-in-delivery-apps">The fight to rein in delivery apps</a></h2><p><strong>Helen Rosner, </strong><strong><em>The New Yorker</em></strong></p><p>The pandemic has intensified the fight between food delivery apps and restaurants.

Well-known leaker Evan Blass has <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446818179636924419">spotted</a> teaser <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html">pages</a> on Carphone Warehouse that shed more light on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, including their software. In a confirmation of past rumors, Google is promising &quot;at least&quot; five years of security updates — that&#39;s longer than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html">Samsung&#39;s four years</a>, and suggests your Pixel 6 will have up-to-date protection as late as 2026.</p><p>The teasers tend to cover officially-released details beyond that, although they do provide a few more details. Not surprisingly, Google is interested in camera tricks — Magic Eraser eliminates photobombers, Face Unblur keeps subjects in focus, and an ultra-wide front camera helps with group selfies. The Pixel 6 will have a 50MP main sensor (up from 12MP) and a 12MP ultra-wide, while the 6 Pro will add a 48MP telephoto lens to the mix.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The product pages also hint at battery life past 24 hours &quot;even on 5G,&quot; with fast 30W wired charging and reverse charging through Battery Share. There&#39;s a new &quot;twice as powerful&quot; Pixel Stand for wireless charging, too. The 6.4-inch Pixel 6 and 6.7-inch 6 Pro will both tout <a href="https://www.engadget.com/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-152221345.html">Gorilla Glass Victus</a> as well as IP68 dust and water resistance, although you&#39;ll have to spring for the 6 Pro if you want an adaptive 120Hz display — you&#39;ll have to &#39;settle&#39; for a Smooth Display (likely 90Hz) on the smaller model.</p><p>Carphone&#39;s listings don&#39;t dive much further into specs. All the same, it&#39;s evident Google is determined to treat the Pixel 6 as a flagship in terms of support, not just performance. Other Android vendors might have a harder time following suit (they&#39;re often tied to policies from chipmakers like Qualcomm), but this could give you at least one option if you want iPhone-like security updates without being tied to Apple&#39;s ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-five-years-android-updates-134435892.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">72ab667c-9e09-467c-83b5-17a5e03fc96b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 13:44:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633799807</ingested><modified>2021-10-09T17:16:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f97a7120-2901-11ec-beff-363b8c82d878" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f97a7120-2901-11ec-beff-363b8c82d878" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google/Carphone Warehouse]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 Pro security graphic]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 Pro security graphic]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple files appeal to delay change in App Store payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The judge who presided over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-appeals-apple-lawsuit-ruiling-193324451.html">Apple vs. Epic</a> case largely sided with the tech giant, except in one area: She <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">ruled</a> that Apple must allow developers to direct users to other payment systems within their apps. Any changes the company has to make to App Store rules to accommodate for that must be in effect by December 9th, or so the judge originally ruled. But now, Apple has <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.821.0_1.pdf">filed a notice of appeal</a> (PDF via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/apple-files-appeal-in-epic-games-case-that-could-delay-changes-.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>) asking for a stay on the injunction, which could push back developers&#39; ability to offer alternative means of payment by one more year.</p><p>In its appeal, Apple wrote that it &quot;has already taken concrete, specific steps in the direction indicated by the Court’s opinion — including by agreeing to eliminate the prohibition on targeted out-of-app communications.&quot; The tech giant argued that it &quot;would be a poor use of resources&quot; to require it to comply with the injunction due to the &quot;near-inevitable litigation&quot; from Epic regarding the scope of its compliance. &quot;There is no reason to expend resources,&quot;it said, adding that &quot;a stay would maintain the status quo while the appellate process progresses to completion.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Trystan Kosmynka, Apple&#39;s senior director of App Review, also said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At a high level, it is my judgment that, without thoughtful restrictions in place to protect consumers, developers, and the iOS platform, this change will harm users, developers, and the iOS platform more generally.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Allowing developers to add in-app links to external payment options would be a major shift for the company. It originally yanked <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store when Epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">offered</a> buyers discounts and freebies if they make their purchases directly from the developer. Shortly after that, the tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-fortnite-apple-lawsuit-developer-tools-190559744.html">removed</a> Epic&#39;s developer tools, as well. Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html">shared</a> communications between the two parties back in September, wherein the tech giant said it wouldn&#39;t allow <em>Fortnite</em> back in the App Store until all court appeals are exhausted. The process could take five years.</p><p>According to a previous analysis by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-small-business-program-15-percent-112259064.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the App Store had gross sales of around $64 billion in 2020. Apple typically takes a 30 percent cut from app purchases, though it recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-small-business-program-15-percent-112259064.html">lowered</a> that to 15 percent for all apps that earn less than $1 million a year. Giving developers the means to accept alternative modes of payment could cost the company billions. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/apple-to-appeal-epic-ruling-loosening-its-grip-on-app-store?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, however, the judge that issued the injunction didn&#39;t specifically mention that the company can&#39;t charge developers a commission for payments made outside the App Store. Whether Apple would still ask developers for a cut remains to be seen, though it would be a complex undertaking if it decides to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>A hearing has been set for Apple&#39;s request to stay the injunction on November 16th, but it&#39;s looking to move the proceeding to November 2nd.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-files-appeal-app-store-injunction-101556698.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">81afe903-5bb7-429b-8d52-1340aaf50cdb</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 10:15:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633775093</ingested><modified>2021-10-09T10:24:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43b5c0b0-e937-11eb-bfef-7247e8383bfc" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43b5c0b0-e937-11eb-bfef-7247e8383bfc" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Emma McIntyre via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WEST HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - JULY 15: Apple CEO Tim Cook attends Apple's "Ted Lasso" season two premiere at Pacific Design Center on July 15, 2021 in West Hollywood, California.

It&#39;s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aston-martin-valhalla-plug-in-hybrid-144200646.html">Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, a 937hp beast of a plug-in hybrid, and it&#39;s just sitting there, with nowhere to go. If you&#39;ve seen a Bond film before, you can imagine it&#39;s holding a slew of killer gadgets (though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32kXCBCoo0Q">hopefully not invisibility</a>). Surely it would appear later in the film, perhaps just in time to save our hero before he sips a martini from a built-in fridge. But no—nobody drives the car throughout the film&#39;s 163-minute runtime. We never even see it in motion. (Though that&#39;s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-bond-007-aston-martin-valhalla-rocket-league-170014713.html">stopping </a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-bond-007-aston-martin-valhalla-rocket-league-170014713.html"><em>Rocket League</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from pitching it as a Bond vehicle.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6bf4e1d1-27b4-11ec-bf7e-3d899cf99d3f" alt="No Time to Die" data-uuid="59634b11-2157-36f9-b387-25a549522aec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicola Dove/DANJAQ, MGM</div></figure><p>That undriven Chekhov&#39;s car makes one thing clear: <em>No Time to Die, </em>directed by Cary Joji-Fukunaga (<em>True Detective, Beasts of No Nation)</em>, isn&#39;t your usual Bond movie. And as I watched the film, a momentous occasion after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Time_to_Die#Release_date_and_postponements">years of delays</a>, I was struck by how few gadgets there were. Sure, Bond gets a cool watch, a classic bulletproof (and gun-equipped) Aston Martin and he rides in something called a gravity plane, but they come few and far in between. Instead, the film focuses on Bond&#39;s human drama: His inability to trust; his persistent death-wish; the danger he brings to others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d57b958eeac448dab09f60b040461cfa"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIhNsAtPbPI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Craig&#39;s Bond was different from the beginning. In 2006&#39;s <em>Casino Royale</em>, he was a fledgling agent he hadn&#39;t yet earned his 00 status. He was gruff and dirty, more used to getting into <em>Bourne-</em>esque fights instead of wearing a tux. But the Bond writer&#39;s and producers could never quite settle on how they wanted to transform the character. 2008&#39;s <em>Quantum of Solace</em> was a disaster mired by the Hollywood writer&#39;s strike (not to mentioned completely incomprehensible action). <em>Skyfall</em> was a return to form, elevating the franchise with Roger Deakin&#39;s Oscar-nominated cinematography. But the series hit a new low with 2015&#39;s <em>Spectre</em>, a boring and regressive film I haven&#39;t had the heart to revisit.</p><p>Strangely, even though <em>No Time to Die</em> is Craig&#39;s final entry, it never tries to one-up the set pieces of its predecessors. There&#39;s a thrilling motorcycle chase early on, which features an astounding practical jump up a flight of stairs, a balletic shoot-out in Cuba, and a few smaller sequences later on. But the film cares less about spectacle than it does setting a mood. That may make it a divisive entry for some, but as someone fascinated by emotional action movies, like Michael Mann&#39;s much-maligned <em>Miami Vice</em> reboot, I found it endlessly compelling. (It helps that <em>No Time to Die</em>, like <em>Casino Royale</em> before it, actually makes you care about Bond and everyone in his orbit.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="835841017bec42db9540a498822dd939" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b69160-27b5-11ec-bbfe-5a58e596c8ef" alt="No Time to Die"></section><p>When I chatted with <em>No Time to Die&#39;s</em> VFX supervisor, Charlie Noble, he had a hard time pointing to a specific whiz-bang set-piece. Unlike Tom Cruise&#39;s latest <em>Mission Impossible </em>movies, this Bond outing isn&#39;t built around a specific stunt or gadget. And after the emptiness of <em>Spectre</em>, I&#39;m all for that. Noble says he&#39;s more concerned with subtle VFX work, like adding additional cars to the background of a chase, or removing wires from a dangerous stunt. Sometimes the best visual effects are the ones you don&#39;t even notice.</p><p>There&#39;s something genuinely refreshing about <em>No Time to Die&#39;s</em> practically lo-fi approach to action, especially after living through more than a decade of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-24-black-panther-vfx-models.html">Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s often weightless CG</a>. Even something that&#39;s genuinely high-tech in the film, like a series of magnets the villains use to jump down an elevator shaft, aren&#39;t dwelled upon. Instead, the focus is on what that action means (in this case, it&#39;s a group of baddies stealing a potentially world-ending nanovirus from a high-security research facility.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6bf4e1d0-27b4-11ec-b8f7-4c7b13083f3d" alt="No Time to Die" data-uuid="ad1552c3-a048-3b24-92a1-bd723b8a7110"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicola Dove/DANJAQ, MGM</div></figure><p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBlOc79L0So">love a good Bond gadget</a> or two. But for an aging franchise that seriously needs to reckon with its sexist and colonialist origins, I&#39;m glad that <em>No Time to Die</em> decided to focus more on its characters. That includes Lashana Lynch&#39;s Nomi, who wastes no time taking up the 007 mantle when Bond disappears, as well as Paloma, a fresh spy recruit who joins for an action romp in Cuba.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Craig may no longer be Bond, but this is a fitting end for his tenure. And the toys aren&#39;t going anywhere—now anyone can use them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/no-time-to-die-review-james-bond-gadget-150053429.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc6884cd-ca9d-484a-9cc5-11788a729d56</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 15:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633704490</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T14:48:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b8db50-27b5-11ec-b5f3-618ade982530" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b8db50-27b5-11ec-b5f3-618ade982530" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MGM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[No Time to Die]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[No Time to Die]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Carol smart exercise bike is a $2,400 paradox]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you had the opportunity, would you pay more in order to use an exercise bike less frequently?

In this example, Carol says that its standard sub-nine-minute workout gives you the equivalent workout to a 45-minute jog.

And <a href="https://carolbike.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Beneficial-effects-of-REHIT.pdf">studies</a> have shown that, at least in male participants, a six-week <a href="https://carolbike.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Beneficial-effects-of-REHIT.pdf">REHIIT program</a> can improve their insulin resistance and oxygen consumption.</p><p>“One of the things I like about REHIIT is the long length of the recovery periods,” says Stuart Moore, trainer and owner of <a href="http://www.wheelfitness.co.uk/">Wheel Fitness</a>, a specialist cycling practice. “This enables people without a lot of experience to recover properly between bouts of hard work and then go again with another round.” He added that “all interval training can be useful,” but stressed that would-be adopters “should get the important checks with your doctor” before trying this sort of thing. “I’d prefer complete beginners to interval training try something more mild than modified versions of HIIT,” he said, “this could help with developing a base before delving into the more intense exercise later.”</p><p>Andrea Speir, co-founder and lead trainer at <a href="https://www.speirpilates.com/">Speir Pilates</a>, added that the psychological benefits on neophyte exercisers were crucial. “Because it spikes the heart rate and improves VO2 Max, cardiac output and boosts the metabolism [...] without being too strenuous,” she said. “It’s not as daunting to commit to it three-to-five times a week, which is where you really see great results,” she added.</p><h2><strong>History</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b37d51e0-281d-11ec-b4b7-bb0910ec149e" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="14fdecbc-f0ab-3236-a442-99e1247ce258"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It’s not often that a company founder announces that their product exists because of a BBC documentary, but Carol isn’t exactly a standard Silicon Valley story. Co-founder Ulrich Dempfle was a management consultant working with the UK’s National Health Service on behalf of firms like McKinsey and PWC. Part of his role was to look for ways to encourage people to exercise more, despite the fact they would often say they didn’t have enough time to become gym bunnies. It wasn’t until he watched 2012’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cywtq"><em>The Truth About Exercise</em></a> that he became a convert to REHIIT.</p><p>The documentary was fronted by Dr. Michael Mosely, who is chiefly responsible for making intermittent fasting mainstream in the UK. One of Mosely’s gimmicks has always been to look for more efficient ways to feel healthy, and this was a love letter to REHIIT. Dempfle and his team contacted the academics whose research was featured in order to get a look at their equipment. Dempfle explained that the bikes featured had their intensity controlled by one of the academics while a person exercised on them, and that the price was astronomical. It was here that the idea of building an affordable REHIIT bike was more or less born. In fact, Carol would wind up being featured in a Mosley’s 2018 follow-up documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09qjl7d/the-truth-about-15-getting-fit"><em>The Truth About Getting Fit</em></a>, albeit not named because of the BBC’s rules against product placement.</p><h2><strong>Bike</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b38e1ac0-281d-11ec-9bbf-97517386540d" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="d9187649-82cc-3a51-9daa-a6ac19e0d7b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>At first glance, Carol could be mistaken for pretty much any at-home exercise bike. It has a very large, rear-slung flywheel and a beefy drive unit, which houses the system to electronically control the resistance, the secret sauce behind the REHIIT program. A pair of short handles with the customary heart rate-monitoring electrodes sit below the display housing, which holds a 10.1-inch screen. The seat height and distance is adjustable, as well as the height of the handlebars, and there are toe cages and clips on the pedals, for pro cyclists.</p><p>After you’ve registered, you can then log in to the bike, which is a process you’ll have to do every time you want to use it. After the first attempt, you can just tap on your initials on a list of stored users, but there’s no way to stay logged in by default. Given how beefy the bike is, and that it’s designed for both at-home and professional use, I feel as if this makes it well-suited to offices and gyms, more so than people’s homes. You could easily see this in the corner of a small business, with staff members getting their 10 minutes each day as they take a break from their work.</p><h2><strong>Display</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b38df3b0-281d-11ec-ad94-fb837fbfb6fb" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="13f19990-1bb5-3901-a63c-3d122ec36715"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>When it comes to screens, there are two schools of thought dominating the at-home fitness market. Peloton’s ubiquity means that consumers may soon expect all machines to have a glossy, massive HD display as the default. Companies like Wattbike, Concept2 and others, however, are happy pushing out machines that still leverage old-school LCD head units. (On a personal note, the Polar View offered by the Wattbike PMB is one of the best training tools I’ve ever encountered).</p><p>Carol splits this difference by offering a 10.1-inch color touchscreen that offers the same sort of data you’d find on an LCD set, but cleaner and more colorful. The UI flashes an angry red when you hit the high intensity phase, and the visualizations showing your power output are great. A software update, too, came through during my review that has made the UI a lot cleaner and smoother than it was before. And, even better, you can use the display to live stream classes from Peloton’s own app, although you’ll need to subscribe to them separately.</p><p>Boot the bike up for the first time and you’ll be greeted by a Lenovo splash screen because Carol’s display is quite literally a Lenovo tablet in a housing. On paper, this is genius: An Android tablet should last longer, is more affordable and should be easier to replace than a custom solution. Plus, you can (and Carol does) leverage Google’s pre-built accessibility features for adjusting screen fonts and voice overs that it would take time and money to copy for little-to-no upside.</p><p>Not to mention that, because it is an Android tablet, you can run third-party apps through the Play Store, albeit only ones that have been sanctioned by Carol’s makers. So far, that’s just Peloton, but there’s no technical reason that your favorite fitness, or entertainment, app couldn’t wind up on this screen as well. But, for all of those positives, slamming an Android tablet onto a bike and calling it quits still feels a bit lackluster for a bike costing <em>two thousand four hundred dollars</em>.</p><h2><strong>In use</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b397dec0-281d-11ec-bfd5-ee1fd9ad9221" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="b521abd9-909d-35ee-bc18-12f43e2b2c4e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Once you’ve answered the medical questionnaire, you have to go through six taster sessions for the bike to gauge your overall fitness level. After that point, you’re free to sample the delights that the bike has to offer, including four different REHIIT workouts. I pretty much stuck to the standard program — the reason anyone would buy a Carol bike — but there are other options available. This includes an Energiser ride, which offers shorter, 10-second sprints, as well as  15-minute or 25 minute Fat Burn program, with 30 or 60 sprints, respectively. You also get the option for a Free Ride, with power controlled by yourself, or an Endurance ride with the resistance slowly ramping up beyond your ability to cope with it.</p><p>Once you’ve chosen a program, you’re asked to choose from a series of generic audio options but, again, I was advised by the company’s representatives to stick with the default. (This was probably for the best, because the other options are essentially musak.) In it, a calm voiceover talks about how neanderthal man never jogged, they either walked slowly, or ran like their lives depended on it. At the same time, the on-screen coaching tells you to breathe in for four seconds, hold for a beat, and then exhale over six seconds, which is hard to coordinate if you’re bad at multitasking. All the while you’re asked to cycle at a very low level, never exceeding an output of 20 watts or so.</p><p>There’s a countdown timer on screen (and a timeline), so it’s not as if you’re not told when the sprints are about to begin. But the narration treats it more like a surprise, talking about the vista when, suddenly, she tells you that there’s a tiger leaping out at you!, and you have to pedal for your life. The screen turns red three seconds before the sprint begins, letting you spool up as you prepare to go hell for leather to escape your predator. Because the resistance is calibrated to your fitness level, it continues to go up after your initial burst of energy to ensure that you’re nicely wiped out by the end of the sprint. Hell, I found that I was flagging at the 10-second mark, and could never get back to my first output peak no matter what I tried.</p><p>You may scoff at the idea that biking for just 20 seconds can wipe you out and make any positive impact on your fitness. You begin to feel your legs go as your body suddenly starts to wuss out, and the final quarter of the sprints have you running on fumes. As effective exercises go, the system makes good upon its promises, and you need that long recovery time to restore any sense of humanity you may have had. The screen will graph your output (and compare it to your output on the second sprint, when you hit it) and let you see how far you’ve dropped between runs. Although the on-screen display’s promise that you won’t sweat is mostly true, it’s not entirely fair for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bosch-freshup-clothes-refreshing-ionizing-wand-140044262.html">sweaty, sweaty</a> boys like me.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b39805d0-281d-11ec-a7fb-09ae8e411682" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="be0a9a3f-86f9-3479-8915-dad110ae8fd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>In the period in which I was using Carol, I think my fitness did improve, as did my mood when I was trying to complete one of these more or less every single day. (The bike repeatedly advises you, as does its representatives, to only do a single sprint session in a 24 hour period and only three times a week to avoid injury.) You certainly start the day feeling more energized, and I can’t complain that this has eaten a big chunk of my day when it hasn’t.</p><p>But I’m finding myself hamstrung by the price, especially given the fact that it’s designed to do one job, one fitness program, to the exclusion of most others. Do I want to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:spend $2,399" href="https://fave.co/3oKmJD6">spend $2,399</a> plus an additional $12 a month on an appliance I’d use for 30 or 40 minutes a week? Yes, that’s less than you can spend on a <a href="https://wattbike.com/us/product/atom-2017">Wattbike Atom</a> or Peloton Bike+, but it’s still a lot. In that philistinic sense of knowing the cost of something but not its value, the numbers make my eyes water.</p><p>It’s a bike that does one thing, really, and it does it well, but I feel in my gut that I’d have an easier time singing this thing’s praises if its price was<em> just</em> below the $2,000 mark. It’s a weird psychological barrier for sure, and maybe you’re scoffing at my imaginary parsimony. But as much as this thing is designed for a mainstream audience, right now, it’s priced at the level where only enthusiasts can buy it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/carol-rehiit-smart-exercise-bike-142103038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a8fcf49-003a-46da-9460-23aeecf99914</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633716783</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T18:13:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the CAROL REHIIT Smart Bike.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Carol Bike ]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
