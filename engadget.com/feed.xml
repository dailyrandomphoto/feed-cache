According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>, the company has been briefing security researchers on the “neuralMatch” system, which would “continuously scan photos that are stored on a US user’s iPhone and have also been uploaded to its iCloud back-up system.”</p><p>The system would “proactively alert a team of human reviewers if it believes illegal imagery is detected” and human reviewers would alert law enforcement if the images were verified. The neuralMatch system, which was trained using a database from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, will be limited to iPhones in the United States to start, the report says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move would be somewhat of an about face for Apple, which has previously stood up to law enforcement to defend users’ privacy. The company famously clashed with the FBI in 2016 after it refused to unlock an iPhone belonging to the man behind the San Bernardino terror attack. CEO Tim Cook said at the time that the government’s request <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html"><ins>was “chilling”</ins></a> and would have far-reaching consequences that could effectively create a backdoor for more government  surveillance. (The FBI ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html"><ins>turned</ins></a> to an outside security firm to unlock the phone.)</p><p>Now, security researchers are raising similar concerns. Though there’s broad support for increasing efforts to fight child abuse, researchers who spoke to the <em>FT </em>said that it could open the door for authoritarian regimes to spy on their citizens, since a system designed to detect one type of imagery could be expanded to other types of content, like terrorism or other content perceived as “anti-government.”</p><p>At the same time, Apple and other companies have faced mounting pressure to find ways to cooperate with law enforcement. As the report points out, social media platforms and cloud storage providers like iCloud already have systems to detect child sexual abuse imagery, but extending such efforts to images on a device would be a significant shift for the company.</p><p>Apple declined to comment to <em>FT,</em> but the company could release more details about its plans  “as soon as this week.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5deec0b-f18e-41e8-8c2e-fa433aa7ec36</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 18:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628189410</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T18:50:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Apple logo hangs inside the glass entrance to the Apple Store on 5th Avenue in New York City, April 4, 2013.

It wasn&#39;t a shock to read about male executives groping their female colleagues, or loudly joking about rape in the office, or completely ignoring women for promotions. What <em>was </em>surprising was that California wanted to investigate Activision Blizzard at all, considering these issues have seemingly been present since its founding in 1979.</p><div id="40fa9112e007484f841c3e3c5f14e835"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/we5QWDLHwXE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Activision Blizzard is a multibillion-dollar publisher with 9,500 employees and a roster of legendary franchises, including Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo and World of Warcraft. On July 20th, California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/YJw">filed a lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard, alleging executives had fostered an environment of misogyny and frat-boy rule for years, violating equal pay laws and labor codes along the way. This is about more than dirty jokes in the break room — the lawsuit highlights clear disparities in hiring, compensation and professional growth between men and women at Activision Blizzard, and it paints a picture of pervasive sexism and outright abuse in the workplace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here’s a rundown of some of the allegations:</p><ul><li><p>Just 20 percent of all Activision Blizzard employees are women.</p></li><li><p>Top leadership roles are filled solely by white men.</p></li><li><p>Across the company, women are paid less, promoted slower and fired faster than men.</p></li><li><p>HR and executives fail to take complaints of harassment seriously.</p></li><li><p>Women of color in particular are micromanaged and overlooked for promotions.</p></li><li><p>A pervasive frat-boy culture encourages behavior like “cube crawls,” where male employees grope and sexually harass female co-workers at their desks.</p></li></ul><p>It’s been a few weeks since the lawsuit was filed, and employees, executives and players have all had a chance to respond. Meanwhile, additional reports of longstanding harassment and sexism at Activision Blizzard have continued to roll out, including photos and stories of the “Cosby Suite,” which was specifically named in the filing. According to the lawsuit, this was a hotel room where male employees would gather to harass women at company events, named after the rapist Bill Cosby.&nbsp;</p><p>Days after the filing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"><em>Kotaku </em>published photos</a> of the supposed Cosby Suite, showing male Activision Blizzard developers posing on a bed with a framed photo of Bill Cosby at BlizzCon 2013. Screenshots of conversations among the developers discussed gathering “hot chixx for the Coz” and other insulting, immature things (especially when you remember these are middle-aged men, not middle-schoolers).</p><p>One of the only executives actually named in the suit was Blizzard head J. Allen Brack, and it alleges he routinely ignored systemic harassment and failed to punish abusers. Brack called the allegations “extremely troubling,” but this line was thrown back in his face on Twitter when independent developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Nelsormensch/status/1418618755437924357">Nels Anderson</a> compared it to <a href="https://youtu.be/Fi5dQzZp3f0?t=264">a video</a> out of BlizzCon 2010, featuring Brack on the far left.&nbsp;</p><div id="e6cdfb096d3841a6839a7823f4ad5e4c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fi5dQzZp3f0?rel=0&amp;start=264" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the video, a young woman asks the panel of <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers, all six of whom are white men, whether they&#39;ll ever create a female character that <em>doesn&#39;t </em>look like she just stepped out of a<em>&nbsp;</em>Victoria&#39;s Secret catalog. The panelists laugh and one responds, &quot;Which catalog would you like them to step out of?&quot; They proceed to essentially dismiss her question. At the end of the exchange, Brack piles on and makes a joke about one of the new characters coming from a sexy cow catalog.</p><p>On August 3rd, just two weeks after California filed its lawsuit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html?src=rss">Brack stepped down</a> from his role as the president of Blizzard. In his place will be GM Mike Ybarra and executive development VP Jen Oneal. Oneal will be the first woman in a president role since Activision’s founding in 1979; the lawsuit notes that there has never been a non-white president or CEO of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s initial response to the lawsuit was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-executives-cant-decide-whether-allegations-of-abuse-are-disturbing-or-meritless/">tragic</a>, with one leader calling the allegations meritless and distorted. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who regularly gets into fights with shareholders over the ridiculous fortune he’s amassed, published <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees">his own response</a> to the lawsuit, where he essentially promised to listen better. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t alleviate many employees’ concerns. A petition in support of the lawsuit ended up gathering more than 2,000 employee signatures, and workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-activision-blizzard-walkout-toxicity-123032466.html">organized a walk-out</a> just eight days after the filing, calling for systemic change at the studio.</p><div id="580ee883838541929e11d7aaef866f6b"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/gDdCyZz" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Shareholders weren&#39;t bolstered by Kotick&#39;s response, either. Investors filed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">an additional class-action lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard on August 3rd, alleging the company failed to raise potential regulatory issues stemming from its discriminatory culture. Blizzard&#39;s head of HR, Jesse Meschuk, also left the company in the weeks following the initial lawsuit.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-29-ubisoft-staff-back-activision-blizzard-protestors-call-for-industry-wide-change">other</a> major <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-maker-weighs-in-on-activision-blizzard-allega-1847349156">game developers</a> have rallied behind the suit, and former Activision Blizzard leaders have <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-co-creator-chris-metzen-on-blizzard-lawsuit-we-1847361133">shared their support</a> for employees, <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp1ie">apologizing</a> for their parts in sustaining a toxic company culture.</p><div id="4981dff1c93c4fd09e7022e5442d8743"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is later than it should have been.

As evidenced by the photos, videos, stats and personal stories flowing out of Activision Blizzard, the company has operated on a bro-first basis for decades, and honestly, it’s been sustained by an industry that largely functions the same way.</p><p>In 2019, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-gamergate-sexual-abuse-twitter-developers-zoe-quinn.html">wave of accusations</a> against prominent male developers crashed over the industry, and AAA studios like Ubisoft and Riot Games made headlines for fostering toxic workplace environments. California is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">currently suing Riot</a> over allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in hiring and pay practices.</p><p>But even that’s not new. Women, non-binary people and marginalized folks in the video game industry have been speaking up about systemic harassment and discrimination for literal decades. Sexism is apparent in the hiring and pay habits of many major studios, and it’s also clear in the games themselves, which feature an overabundance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-17-gender-video-games-e3-feminist-frequency-numbers.html">straight, white, male protagonists</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>surprising, this time around, is that the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard kind of came out of nowhere. It took a blockbuster media report to make California sue Riot in 2020, but the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard appeared on its own, after years of quiet investigation by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. If sexism is systemic in the video game industry, it feels like the system is finally fighting back.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7da88755-aa94-4059-818d-d5bae49cbff5</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628181712</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T16:42:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in , in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paramount+ will launch in Europe in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbsclick=156VUfX8XxyLWbxyAT2WyRb6UkBRUkynXS9TWc0&amp;vndid=2055067&amp;clickid=2055067&amp;sharedid=&amp;ftag=PPM-09-10aag1f&amp;dclid=CjkKEQjwmK6IBhCI4fOn_rvo3bIBEiQACJT-gqeO4ooyS2GQLhrzBMAZ3cTxTUxCG7UZjd54WV_o1Ynw_wcB">Paramount+</a> is finally expanding into Europe — with a little help.

This could be the most significant expansion to date, though. Europe is a major market for streaming, and Sky&#39;s influence in the region could put the service in front of people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise have considered it. This won&#39;t bring Paramount+ to the level of heavyweights like Netflix or Prime Video,  but it could help competition against narrowly focused rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">HBO Max</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-europe-launch-145633779.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac7f168-63ea-4255-9d03-d82b85c66663</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628177326</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T15:29:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/29: In this photo illustration, Paramount+ (Paramount Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone against its website in the background.

If you&#39;re on the lookout for an upgrade, it may be worth considering the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wifi-router-canada-europe-availability-145751787.html"><ins>Google WiFi mesh system</ins></a>. A three-pack of nodes currently costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Wifi-System-Router-Replacement/dp/B08GG9CMLR?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=a28ac540f250a97d6669cd054110c7ca&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><ins>$149</ins></a> on Amazon.

Google WiFi supports speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, the company says. It claims a single point can support multiple simultaneous 4K video streams, though the size of your home, building materials and layout can impact signal strength.</p><p>The system uses WPA3 encryption and dual-band connectivity, as well as security updates and parental controls. You can manage the network using the Google Home app.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting Google WiFi isn&#39;t quite as fast as the Nest WiFi system. Each node can cover up to 1,500 square feet, compared with 2,200 square feet for the Nest WiFi router and 1,600 square feet for each additional point. The latter also has a built-in Google Assistant smart speaker. A Nest WiFi three-pack costs <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US">$350</a>, though. If you&#39;re in the market for a solid mesh system that won&#39;t break the bank, Google WiFi might do the trick.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wifi-mesh-system-deal-amazon-143831298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">538a75a7-e157-4dbf-9566-a6469b575750</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:38:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628174314</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T14:38:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden wants half of new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden is throwing more of his weight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">behind electric cars</a>.

The move is meant to not only promote clean transportation and limit climate change, but help the US &quot;outcompete&quot; a Chinese car industry that&#39;s quickly shifting toward electrified vehicles.</p><p>In sync with the order, the EPA and NHTSA will outline how they plan to undo the Trump administration&#39;s rollbacks of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-16-states-sue-to-prevent-epa-from-revoking-state-emissions-powers.html">emissions</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-31-epa-safe-rule.html">fuel efficiency</a> standards.

The EPA&#39;s proposed rules would take effect in the 2023 model year, while the NHTSA&#39;s would arrive in the 2024 model year.

Among the newcomers are Google’s first battery-powered Nest Cam and Doorbell, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-leak-nest-cameras-doorbell-035732377.html">as a recent leak indicated</a>. You’ll be able to install them just about anywhere around your home, and connect them to a wired power source, if you prefer.</p><p>The battery life depends on how many recorded events the devices detect and factors like the temperature and settings. Google says the Doorbell’s battery will run for up to six months on a single charge, while the Nest Cam can run for up to seven months before you need to juice it up. You can recharge the Doorbell over USB-C, and the camera using an included USB-A adaptor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27fea8a0-f558-11eb-9ddd-6e79762844f3" alt="Battery-powered Google Nest Doorbell" data-uuid="59bbf247-1cd3-39e8-93c6-908b01c24e23"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The Doorbell captures video at a resolution of 989 x 1280 pixels at up to 30 frames per second. It has a 6x digital zoom, 145-degree diagonal field of view and can see up to 10 feet away in the dark thanks to its night vision capabilities. It also has a 3:4 field of view so you can get a full head-to-toe look at whoever shows up at your door.</p><p>As for the Nest Cam, it can capture video in 1080p at up to 30 fps. The device has a 130-degree diagonal field of view, 6x digital zoom and night vision that can see objects up to 20 feet away. It has an IP54 rating for weather resistance too. As well as mounting it outside, you can set up the camera indoors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3df2edb0-f558-11eb-b9ff-8d889682a497" alt="Battery-powered Google Nest Cam" data-uuid="1fdbd755-b45f-3d4e-aae7-9dc80a48ba1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Both products, which are designed with recycled materials, offer up to three hours of event video history. You can increase that with a Nest Aware subscription. Like some other Nest cameras, the battery-powered Nest Cam offers around-the-clock video recording with a Nest Aware Plus subscription, though you&#39;ll need to hook it up to a continuous power source.</p><p>In addition, the company is offering a Nest Cam with an integrated floodlight for the first time. One thing that all four devices have in common is that they&#39;re designed to only alert you to important events. They all have on-device machine learning capabilities to recognize and alert you to people, animals and vehicles. The Doorbell can detect and recognize packages placed as close as eight inches to your door. Google says don&#39;t need a subscription to use these features and that it trained the machine learning model on 40 million images to account for a variety of environments and lighting conditions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/504cf500-f558-11eb-9fbe-81e0b5583eaa" alt="Google Nest Cam with floodlight" data-uuid="c85b35eb-49dc-3bab-8ef6-3de3c03031f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The devices also offer a familiar-face detection feature for Nest Aware subscribers.

In a statement, the Amazon says that it is launching two programs for businesses that use the retail giant’s infrastructure.

They can connect with Amazon’s bulk resale partners and try to, in the words of the company&#39;s corporate parlance, “recover a portion of their inventory cost.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement comes shortly after the controversial report from <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds"><em>ITV News</em></a>, which claimed that truckloads of brand new products were marked for destruction.

As <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/566403-amazon-working-to-cut-waste-after-report-found-unsold-stock-was-destroyed"><em>The Hill</em></a> explained, the consequences of that report have raised hackles in the UK, with Labour MPs <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/559804-british-lawmakers-demand-meeting-with-amazon-after-video-shows-products">demanding</a> an explanation for the evidence presented. At the time, Amazon said that “no items are sent to landfill,” but as a last resort, some are sent to “energy recovery.”</p><p>Libby Johnson McKee, director of Amazon Returns, ReCommerce and Sustainability, said that the new initiatives are one example of how Amazon is trying to &quot;ensure that products sold on Amazon […] go to good use and don&#39;t become waste.” McKee added that the policies will help reduce costs and help companies who use Amazon&#39;s fulfillment platform will be able to grow their businesses. FBA Grade and Resell is available in the UK now, with other European nations coming online across next year. FBA Liquidations, meanwhile, is available in the US and other European nations, but is coming to the UK in August.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fba-grading-returns-wholesale-policy-changes-114014902.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c73fef0-131c-43aa-a391-de4bc5b6831d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628162064</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T11:14:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Stirk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LEEDS, ENGLAND - MAY 27: A general view outside an Amazon UK Services Ltd Warehouse at Leeds Distribution Park on May 27, 2021 in Leeds, England.

This is the “problem” that Nintendo is currently dealing with as it publishes its most recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805e.pdf">quarterly report</a>, reflecting the fact that the world has changed once again. In the three months to June 30th, the company posted an operating profit of 119 billion yen, which works out to roughly $1.1 billion. That is, however, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-hardware-software-sales-double-year-over-year-075033312.html">17.3 percent drop compared to the 144 billion yen</a> ($1.3 billion) posted this time last year, when people were mandated to spend much more time indoors.</p><p>The other difference compared to last year is a lack of a brand-name Nintendo title to draw in users like it had in 2020. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-16-animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-switch.html"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a> was (according to some analysts) the third-biggest selling game of the year, which also drove sales of new Switch consoles to buyers looking to get in on the action. In fact, <em>New Horizons</em> is still a big selling title, with 1.26 million units sold in this quarter, a year after it was originally launched. And Nintendo’s software sales in total were only 10.2 percent smaller than the trade it did across the same period last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rather amusingly, Nintendo broke out a graph in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210805_3e.pdf">financial report</a> showing that, if you remove the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-video-game-sales-diablo-ii-virtual-economies-131547613.html"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> spike, its software sales have constantly increased since at least 2018. The fact that investors are still apparently nervous about Nintendo’s future — to the point where <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/nintendo-buying-back-shares-after-profit-misses-estimates?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> is reporting that the company will issue stock buybacks to cover the gap in fallen sales — shows the disconnect between Wall Street and the world the rest of us are living in. But the company hasn’t altered its sales forecast or plans for the rest of the year, such is its confidence about its business.</p><p>Nintendo’s financial health is going to look a lot rosier in the back half of 2021 anyway, with a number of big titles out, and soon to be released. The HD remake of <em>Zelda: Skyward Sword</em> isn’t covered in this report, and <em>WarioWare: Get It Together</em> drops in September. October sees the launch of <em>Metroid Dread</em> and <em>Mario Party Superstars</em>, while November sees the launch of <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl</em>. Plus, you know, there’s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">OLED Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">Zelda Game and Watch</a> coming to boost hardware sales.</p><p>Not to mention that next year is likely to feature a third <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splatoon-3-nintendo-switch-announcement-2022-232415600.html"><em>Splatoon</em></a> game, a sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-164912773.html"><em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and a new entry in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mario-rabbids-sparks-of-hope-nintendo-switch-ubisoft-2022-201632962.html"><em>Mario+Rabbids</em></a> series. And what investors are forgetting, it seems, is that if we’re all asked to start traveling to work again, it’s more likely that we’ll be tempted to bring along those Switch consoles some folks panic-bought at the start of last year. Which will require a steady stream of new games to keep their fingers entertained while sat on the bus or subway.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-2021-q1-financial-post-animal-crossing-slump-100125720.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d61e0e5-4341-4315-8acf-5fb255dee938</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 10:01:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628157687</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T10:01:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8998500-f5d2-11eb-acf7-5fcf7979aacc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8998500-f5d2-11eb-acf7-5fcf7979aacc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zhang Peng via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TIANJIN, CHINA - 2021/07/20: A cartoon figurine of Super Mario Bros. stands in front of a Nintendo Switch store in a shopping market.

It also gives you access to Amazon Originals made especially for the platform, including the crime drama <em>Leverage: Redemption</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fabbad10-f5a3-11eb-adfd-65dd18f3e473" style="height:855;width:800;" alt="IMDb" data-uuid="354d3f81-df1e-3552-9d85-78c9d1006c11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IMDb</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/imdb-tv-standalone-apps-android-ios-053142618.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fe1ff85-7f09-465e-8396-b787305b6ff3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 05:31:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628137129</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T04:19:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/10a76670-25a1-11ea-b6df-fc9d18776d99" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/10a76670-25a1-11ea-b6df-fc9d18776d99" width="8688" height="5792" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EMS-FORSTER-PRODUCTIONS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Relaxed man sitting on sofa using cell phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony reportedly showed off its next-generation PSVR at a developer's conference]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-vr-ps5-details-142756612.html">already hinted</a> that it&#39;s working on a new PlayStation VR headset, promising &quot;dramatic leaps&quot; in performance, higher resolution, a wider field of view, better tracking and a new controller. On Tuesday, Sony reportedly revealed more specifics about the headset at a developer&#39;s summit, according to the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnAOWbzBEco">PSVR Without Parole</a> (below) and <a href="https://uploadvr.com/ps5-vr-headset-hdr-oled-aaa"><em>UploadVR</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.</p><div id="845e4e5bc6a341ee8a4662b3c1e742e1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnAOWbzBEco?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The device is reportedly codenamed next-gen VR (NGVR) and features controllers with capacitive touch sensors that can detect when you&#39;re holding the controller or touching the buttons, and even sense the distance to your fingers. Sony also reportedly told developer&#39;s that it&#39;s planning optional VR support for all AAA releases, so you could play them either in VR or on your TV — much like it did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-28-resident-evil-7-vr-ps4-psvr-review-video.html"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-02-no-mans-sky-vr-hands-on-interview-sean-murray.html"><em>No Man&#39;s Sky</em></a> on the PS4 and PS5.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>PSVR Without Parole also noted that the next-gen PSVR will offer a 110-degree field of view that&#39;s 10 degrees wider than the PSVR. To make the most of those pixels, it will use flexible scaling resolution, along with foveated rendering that uses eye-tracking to improve resolution where you&#39;re looking. <em>UploadVR</em>, meanwhile, said that the the headset will feature high-resolution 2,000 x 2,040 OLED displays (4K in total).&nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;ve already heard that the PSVR will connect to PlayStation consoles with a single cable, with no passthrough box required. It will also use inside-out tracking and offer adaptive triggers and haptic feedback on the controllers.</p><p>All told, the PSVR 2 (or whatever it&#39;s called) should have features mostly on par with rival headsets like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2 </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html">HTC Vive Pro 2</a>. However, Sony itself said that the headset won&#39;t launch until at least next year, and a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/fading-iphone-lcd-screen-maker-pivots-to-virtual-reality"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report from June indicated it might not come until late in 2022. For now, though, all of that is still grist for the rumor mill until Sony announces something official, possibly later this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-reportedly-showed-off-its-next-generation-psvr-at-a-developers-conference-035843223.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d38a1116-84ff-4dac-81d1-43be9ab557a9</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 03:58:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628135924</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T03:59:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eb419b90-f5a0-11eb-876b-668967e3ae60" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eb419b90-f5a0-11eb-876b-668967e3ae60" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony reportedly showed off its next-generation PSVR at a developer's conference]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony reportedly showed off its next-generation PSVR at a developer's conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok tests Stories feature outside of the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok is no stranger to other companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html">copying the format</a> of its signature short-form videos, but it may now do the same with Stories. <a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1422978662169710597?s=20">Per a tweet</a> shared by social media consultant and former <em>The</em><em>Next Web</em> writer Matt Navarra, the company has introduced posts that disappear after 24 hours.

Its release date initially slipped to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-closed-beta-gameplay-trailer-202040532.html">August 25th, 2020</a>, before Amazon announced a month later it was pushing the game back to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-world-delayed-2021-213019137.html">spring 2021</a>. At the start of the year, it then delayed the game to its most recently planned August <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-new-world-august-31-202202548.html">31st release date</a>.</p><p>To say there&#39;s a lot of pressure on Amazon Game Studios to deliver a hit for its parent company would be an understatement. Amazon announced the game&#39;s<em>&nbsp;</em>first major delay after taking the unusual step of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-crucible-returns-to-closed-beta-195826434.html">rolling back the availability of <em>Crucible,</em> its first AAA title</a>. It later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-crucible-003348633.html">ended the development of that game</a>. Before taking over as CEO of Amazon, Andy Jassy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/andy-jassy-committed-to-amazon-game-studios-213722395.html">told employees he was committed to the studio</a>. &quot;Though we haven&#39;t consistently succeeded yet in Amazon Game Studios, I believe we will if we hang in there,&quot; he said in an email. Now it&#39;s on the <em>New World</em> team to prove that confidence was well-earned.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-mmo-delay-september-28-203855352.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b5975b7-f68b-4f23-8d8e-eeecf0e023c4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 20:38:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628107556</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T20:06:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ddd0bba0-f55d-11eb-9f7f-f26a17402295" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ddd0bba0-f55d-11eb-9f7f-f26a17402295" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon Game Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New World]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[New World]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max adds scripted stories to its growing podcast library]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HBO Max has grown its Podcast Program by leaps and bounds over the past two years expanding from 4 shows in 2019 to 25 today, many serving as tie-ins and companion pieces to HBO&#39;s various series.

These were impressive goals, but what was missing was any sense of how they&#39;d actually achieve them. Now, we finally know Intel&#39;s plan.</p><p>Intel&#39;s CEO Pat Gelsinger and SVP of Technology Development Dr. Ann Kelleher, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">laid out the company&#39;s plan for the future.</a> For starters, Intel is renaming its manufacturing nodes. What used to be 10nm &quot;Enhanced Superfin&quot; is now just &quot;7.&quot; This may feel a little duplicitous — &quot;just wave a wand a you&#39;ve got better technology!&quot; — but to be fair to intel, the nanometer measurements of process nodes don&#39;t really correspond to anything physical any more, and in terms of density Intel&#39;s current 10nm chips are competitive with TSMC and Samsung&#39;s 7nm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Looking beyond 7nm, Intel is targeting an aggressive release schedule with major product updates happening annually. We&#39;re expecting their Alder Lake chips this fall, which will mix high and low-powered cores, followed by now-4nm Meteor Lake chips that will move to a &quot;tile&quot; (chiplet) design, and incorporate Intel&#39;s 3D stacked-chip technology, Foveros.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond that, Intel has technology mapped out for an EUV-based 3nm node that will use the high-energy manufacturing process to streamline chip creation, and a &quot;20A&quot; for angstrom node. This is one ten-billionth of a meter (meaning it&#39;s 2nm), and will be followed by a 18A node that Intel hopes to start moving into production in 2025 for products sometime in the 2nd half of the decade. Again, while node measurements don&#39;t really correspond to physical structures any more, a silicon atom is in the area of 2 angstroms wide, so these are seriously tiny transistors.</p><p>This release schedule seems aggressive, and Intel does not have the best track record of meeting targets for new nodes, but if it can even come close to these goals, expect your laptops and desktops to get a huge performance boost in the next few years.&nbsp;</p><p>For even more info on Intel&#39;s plans, and details on its EMIB interconnect technology and two new versions of Foveros, be sure to check out the video above.

As long as you owned a copy of the game, you had access to it. However, much like Rockstar did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/red-dead-online-release-date-standalone-rockstar-games-172148154.html"><em>Red Dead Online</em></a>, Sony now plans to offer a standalone version of Legends.</p><p>Available starting on September 3rd, the company will sell this release of the mode for $19.99. Aside from some in-game cosmetics you can only earn by playing through <em>Ghost of Tsushima’s</em> single-player story, everything that’s included in the version that comes with the full game is also present here, and you can play with those who own the entire experience. That first point is important because Sucker Punch has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/04/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-gets-standalone-release-adds-new-rivals-mode-on-september-3/">various free updates planned for Legends</a>, the most notable of which is a new mode called Rivals that comes out on the same day as the standalone release.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Taking a page from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-19-destiny-2-forsaken-gambit-mode-free-weekend.html"><em>Destiny 2’s</em> Gambit mode</a>, Rivals pits two teams of two individuals against waves of enemies. As you defeat foes, you’ll earn a resource called “Magatama,” which you can use to delay the opposing team by doing things like casting curses on them. Once you’ve spent enough Magatama, you will unlock a final wave. Defeat that, and you’ll have won the match.&nbsp;</p><p>Sucker Punch has other updates for Legends planned, including a variety of quality-of-life tweaks. Starting on September 10th, the studio also plans to release content each week until October 1st. Players can look forward to new Survival mode maps and a more challenging version of last year’s raid.&nbsp;</p><p>If you decide you want to play through <em>Ghost of Tsushima’s </em>single-player story after experiencing Legends by itself, you can purchase an upgrade to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html">Director’s Cut</a>, which includes the full story and a new island to explore, for $40 on PS4 or $50 on PS5.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-standalone-release-september-3-165034525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17ba6d6c-aa3b-4833-9e24-6a79f111e6ac</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 16:50:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628094807</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:33:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64790690-f53f-11eb-9b9f-85156022e950" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64790690-f53f-11eb-9b9f-85156022e950" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sucker Punch Productions / Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
