The company builds a bunch of useful tools for making the most of your electronic music setup, but its specially designed <a href="https://www.retrokits.com/shop/rk002/">MIDI cable</a> that adds features like velocity control to the Volca FM have proven quite popular. The latest member of its lineup though, is quite a bit more ambitious.</p><p>The RK-008 is a full fledged MIDI control center. It&#39;s an eight track MIDI sequencer and recorder, which allows it to be the glue that keeps your rig together. It also has a built-in metronome to help you stay in time with your instruments, which is important since all MIDI data is recorded unquantized. (Though you can quantize it after the fact, and then undo if you prefer to go back to your original sloppy playing.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="662eff2bdda24c2d87570aeb887441a1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjl4o9zIHj8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Each track can record on multiple channels, so you can actually control multiple devices from a single track, leaving the other seven open for... even more devices? You can even record eight parts across the eight tracks, then consolidate them down to one, freeing up more room for sequencing. And of course you can overdub or overwrite any performances.</p><p>Each of the tracks can be manipulated independently too. Allowing you to quantize them, add swing or transpose them. And it&#39;s all non-destructive, so you can easily undo your changes.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also a simple step sequencer built-in to the RK-008. It&#39;s probably not gonna work for complex chords, but does the job just fine it seems for four on the floor drums.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s two MIDI inputs and two MIDI outputs on the back, plus a separate dedicated sync port. Tracks can be assigned to one or both outputs, which is handy if you&#39;ve got that one drum machine that insists on having each instrument on a separate channel. The two in ports means you can merge MIDI from different sources, but also use different controllers for different instruments.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a feature list as is, and Retrokits says there&#39;s still more to be revealed, which is incredibly impressive for something that looks like pocket calculator from the 1980s — and I mean that as a good thing. The RK-008 looks part <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-one-retro-music-production-machine-142916111.html">MPC</a>, part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HP29C.jpg">HP calculator</a>, could probably fit in a pocket and yet seems capable of controlling an entire live music rig.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still some outstanding questions though, most importantly when it will come out and how much it will cost. But hopefully we&#39;ll find out sooner than later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/retrokits-rk-008-midi-sequencer-recorder-pocket-calculator-superbooth-232319863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">943a46ee-2f3f-4771-8b7e-c8ceb35c81d8</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 23:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631834161</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T23:16:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Retrokits]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian announces membership plan with complimentary charging and LTE connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With R1T trucks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">rolling off the assembly line</a> at its factory in Normal, Illinois, Rivian continues to prepare for the official debut of its first EVs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">later this month</a>.

He&#39;s best known for his namesake company&#39;s ZX computers, which thrived in the UK during the early 1980s — he succeeded in making home PCs accessible at a time when most models were still major expenses. A ZX Spectrum 16K, for instance, cost £125 where Apple launched the Apple II for $1,298 just a few years earlier.</p><p>Sinclair is also widely credited with having invented the first pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive, in 1972. Texas Instruments&#39; first programmable calculator (the HP-65) didn&#39;t arrive until 1974. He was an early pioneer of electric transportation, too, having developed the C5 electric tricycle in 1985.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like many inventors, his projects didn&#39;t always succeed. Sinclair&#39;s computer business ran into trouble in 1984 with the ill-fated QL, and he sold the company to Amstrad in 1985. And while the C5 may have been decades ahead of its time, that didn&#39;t translate to sales. Sinclairs&#39; vehicle business ran aground less than a year after the C5&#39;s debut.</p><p>Sinclair&#39;s legacy is clear, however. For many gamers and game developers, Sinclair&#39;s computers represented a watershed moment. McGill University <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/z/ZX_Spectrum.htm">noted</a> that many famous creators and studios, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-28-no-fable-creator-peter-molyneux-isnt-retiring-today.html">Peter Molyneux</a>, David Perry and Rare, cut their teeth on ZX Spectrums. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ti-bans-assembly-programs-on-calculators-002335088.html">Pocket calculators</a> are still useful even in the smartphone era. And it&#39;s safe to say EVs are here to stay, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-fxe-video-162013401.html">open-air rides</a>. There&#39;s a real chance Sinclar&#39;s work has affected the technology in your life, even if you&#39;ve never touched one of his products.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clive-sinclair-dead-obituary-212309487.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">866b1c96-0b42-49d0-86c1-0dba6becfa75</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:23:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631825424</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T20:50:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f47b0d0-1728-11ec-bddd-763fe74b1cd6" width="5873" height="3780" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f47b0d0-1728-11ec-bddd-763fe74b1cd6" width="5873" height="3780" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Levenson via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON - JANUARY 10: Sir Clive Sinclair launches his new electric vehicle the Sinclair C5, at Alexandra Palace, London on January 10, 1985.

He was one of the first to obtain the revised model and what he found after tearing down the console was that Sony had equipped it with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html">smaller and lighter heatsink</a>. In testing the unit, Evans found exhaust temperatures were higher than on the launch variant, leading him to claim it &quot;worse&quot; than its predecessor. That&#39;s a statement that led to controversy, and, in some cases, confusion over whether people should buy the updated CFI-1100 model.</p><div id="e6770106768941829959993a8de260a2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8-97fwkO78?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Now we have a more definitive answer on what the new heatsink means for the PlayStation 5. Working together, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-playstation-5-cfi-1100-review-better-or-worse-than-the-launch-console"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/VgWuGA8cExo"><em>Gamers Nexus</em></a> conducted an independent teardown and analysis of the console. The short answer of what they found is that &quot;in all practical terms, there is no meaningful difference between PS5s old and new.&quot; The longer answer is that the new PS5&#39;s cooling performance is more complicated than was first reported.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to featuring a new thermal assembly, Sony tweaked the motherboard and baseplate found in the refreshed PS5. The result of those changes is some components run cooler while others get hotter. However, <em>Digital Foundry</em> states, &quot;there is no evidence that this presents anything worth worrying about, assuming you are keeping your PS5 in a well-ventilated area.&quot;</p><p>Critically, the outlet found that once it installed the latest firmware from Sony, there was also no difference in performance between the new and old models. Both variants will pull as much power as they need to maintain a sufficient boost clock and throttle their fans to limit noise. Even as both consoles get hotter, you won&#39;t notice a dip in performance in the way you would with a PC GPU. Either way, should they hit a critical temperature where their components are in danger, both will automatically shut down to prevent damage.</p><div id="cbde2620e14c4dc79058b5137f865655"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jEccWyHUXYY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The core question of whether the new PS5 is better or worse than the launch model can be answered by saying that they&#39;re mostly much the same, certainly in terms of the end-user experience,&quot; according to <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p><p>The main takeaway from the analysis conducted by the outlets<em>&nbsp;</em>is that you can safely buy the updated model. You don&#39;t need to go out of your way to find the launch variant. In fact, it&#39;s probably best you avoid doing so since many scalpers have tried to take advantage of the fallout from the initial video Evans posted by selling their launch models for even more money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-cfi-1100-digital-foundry-analysis-204522648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34ec9751-168f-4b43-b62f-3cc226455c12</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:45:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631825126</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T20:45:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot is the latest developer to release its own game launcher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of game developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-rockstar-games-launcher-pc.html">releasing launchers</a> that feel redundant?

A court ordered the studio to compensate O&#39;Donnell financially but said he couldn&#39;t publish any music from <em>Destiny </em>without Bungie&#39;s blessing.

He also has to pay Bungie all the money he earned from selling tracks tied to the symphony on Bandcamp, in addition to compensating it for expenses it accrued during the contempt proceeding.

During a call with reporters, the company’s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the policy is necessary because bad actors are increasingly trying to “blur the lines” between authentic and inauthentic behavior.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We are seeing groups that pose a risk of significant social harm, that also engage in violations on our platform, but don&#39;t necessarily rise to the level for either of those where we’d enforce against for inauthenticity under CIB [coordinated inauthentic behavior] or under our dangerous organizations policy,” Gleicher said. “So this protocol is designed to capture these groups that are sort of in between spaces.”</p><p>Gleicher added that the new protocols could help Facebook address networks of accounts spreading anti-vaccine misinformation or groups trying to organize political violence. In announcing the change, Facebook said it took down a small network of accounts in Germany that were linked to the “Querdenken” movement, which has spread conspiracy theories about the country COVID-19 restrictions and has been “linked to off-platform violence.”</p><p>Facebook said it could take “a range of actions” in enforcing its new rules around coordinated social harm. That could include banning accounts — as it did with the “Querdenken” movement — or throttling their reach to prevent content from spreading as widely.</p><p>The issue of how to handle groups that break Facebook’s rules in a coordinated way has been a difficult one for the company, which up until now has primarily focused on taking down networks that rely on fake accounts to manipulate its platform. The issue came up earlier this year following the January 6th insurrection as Facebook investigated the “Stop the Steal” movement. According to an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html"><ins>internal report </ins></a>obtained by <em>BuzzFeed News</em>, Facebook employees suggested its existing policies weren’t equipped to handle “inherently harmful” coordination by legitimate accounts, which prevented it from realizing “Stop the Steal” was a “cohesive movement” until it was too late.</p><p>During a press call, Gleicher said that the “work on this policy started well before January 6th.” But he added that the company’s work against high-profile groups had informed their decision making. “If you think about our enforcement against QAnon-related actors, if you think about our enforcement against ‘Stop the Steal,’ if you think about our enforcement against other groups — we learned from all of them.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-social-harm-180601493.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a0098f4-4165-478e-a164-dd76101a4ce9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:06:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631815561</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T18:06:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen through two moving buses in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018.

The automaker has paired news of pre-production work with a <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/16/ford-begins-pre-production-f-150-lightning.html">promise</a> to invest an extra $250 million and create 450 new jobs to increase production capacity. That should help Ford build 80,000 Lightning trucks per year — little comfort when the company now has 150,000 reservations, but the move should reduce wait times.</p><p>Most of the jobs will go to workers assembling the electric F-150 at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, while others will build more batteries at the Rawsonville Components Plant and motors at the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center. The first trucks should be available in spring 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The production numbers won&#39;t compete with conventional trucks for a while. As <em>Autoweek</em><a href="https://www.autoweek.com/news/trucks/a32945300/ford-averages-over-100-f-150-pickups-sold-per-hour-247/">observed</a>, Ford averaged sales of about 900,000 regular F-150 trucks per year before the pandemic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-ev-delays-chip-shortage-161826367.html">chip shortages</a> came into play. While the Lightning may be more than a niche product, it&#39;s not yet at the point where Ford would have to reconsider its conventional truck production.</p><p>There&#39;s also a certain amount of posturing involved with the news. Ford is clearly eager to please a government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">promoting made-in-America EVs</a>. However, it&#39;s still a recognition of pent-up demand for electric pickups, both from Ford and from the industry as a whole. Not that Ford might have much choice. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">Rivian already producing its first trucks</a>, Ford risks losing sales to competitors if it doesn&#39;t ramp up manufacturing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-ramps-up-f-150-lightning-production-165311045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a69fb154-cbf4-42fc-af2c-db85eaf32d6c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:53:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631810603</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T16:43:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7cfe680-1708-11ec-9f7b-365e88cbaa93" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7cfe680-1708-11ec-9f7b-365e88cbaa93" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford F-150 Lightning at Rouge Electric Vehicle Center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford F-150 Lightning at Rouge Electric Vehicle Center]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boss' SY-200 is a powerful guitar synth that fits on a pedalboard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boss is certainly no stranger to the world of guitar synths. In fact, Roland and Boss have been at the forefront of guitar synths and MIDI controllers since the &#39;70s.  After launching the absolutely epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-boss-sy-1000-guitar-synth-effects-pedal.html">SY-1000</a> in 2019, then cramming a bunch of synth sounds into an actual guitar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boss-guitar-built-in-synth-and-bluetooth-pedal-control-080328921.html">Eurus</a> earlier this year, Boss is going a little more traditional with the SY-200.&nbsp;</p><p>The SY-200 isn&#39;t quite as big as the 1000, which is basically a pedalboard in and of itself. But it&#39;s definitely larger and more comprehensive than the compact Boss pedals you&#39;re probably familiar with, like the <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/sy-1/">SY-1</a> synth. The 200 has 171 different sounds spread across 12 different categories and can be played without the need for a special pickup.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1e1c52a141544debb42538c1bfcfdddb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hQ1MEcTycY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Each voice has three parameters that you can customize, which pales in comparison to the full on programable synth inside the SY-1000, but it&#39;s definitely a lot more approachable and pedalboard-friendly. You&#39;ve everything from ripping leads, to warm pads, to delicate bell tones at your disposal. (Though, the Boss demo video above is real heavy on traditional guitar shredding.) Oh, and it&#39;s fully polyphonic, which we&#39;ve come to expect from Boss synth pedals, but it&#39;s still worth calling out.</p><p>There&#39;s two foot switches for giving you some control over live variation while playing, but you can also connect an expression pedal, or control parameters and program changes via MIDI. You&#39;ve got 128 preset slots for saving and recalling your favorite sounds. And last, but definitely not least, there are send and return jacks for blending in other effects in parallel with your synth sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The Boss SY-200 will be available for $300 in January alongside Boss&#39; new IR-based amp and cab simulator, the IR-200, which will retail for $400.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boss-sy-200-guitar-pedal-synth-superbooth-164427743.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02e1794f-9e7d-416e-9cc4-43e44610a799</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:44:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631815124</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T17:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44b7def0-170c-11ec-9bfe-353b748e8465" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44b7def0-170c-11ec-9bfe-353b748e8465" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Boss]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boss SY-200 synth pedal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boss SY-200 synth pedal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cadillac Lyriq EV reservations open on September 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cadillac is preparing to leap into the electric vehicle market with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-lyriq-luxury-ev-first-look-video-171543752.html"><ins>Lyriq</ins></a>, and now the automaker has revealed when you&#39;ll be able to lock in your reservation.

We meet again, Razer Huntsman. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-razer-huntsman-elite-hands-on.html">first opto-mechanical keyboard</a> was an interesting experiment, one I wasn’t too fond of thanks to its unpleasant key feel and noise. After three years (and a mini edition) later Razer is back with a new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Huntsman V2" href="https://fave.co/3kmDLVD">$200 version</a>, and it does seem the designers finally nailed it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/113aab70-165d-11ec-9f6c-e6f8d13b254c" alt="Keys on the Razer Huntsman v2" data-uuid="a956af94-9f3a-3432-a10f-403b4ffc29f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>First, a refresher: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/corsair-k100-gaming-keyboard-hands-on-130002628.html">opto-mechanical keys</a> have a small laser beam under each switch. When you press a key, it blocks the light path, sending a signal to the computer of what you just pressed. Because it doesn’t need to fully actuate (go up and down) on a physical level, it’s supposedly faster than traditional mechanical keyboards. In practice I didn’t really notice the difference and even now I can’t really distinguish the nanoseconds shaved off with each key press on the Huntsman V2.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1861c400-165e-11ec-a47f-2f15d2851388" alt="Red and purple key switches" data-uuid="7946b6e6-0663-3db7-98f2-2e7b80a46ab8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>However, what I can feel and hear is the layer of foam padding under the keys that mutes each stroke, which makes it a much more agreeable auditory experience — the first version had this annoying metallic echo that I could pick up even with my admittedly poor hearing. Granted, if you’re wearing a headset and listening to gunshots or music you probably won’t notice, but if you work in an office as I do, or share a small space with others, the comfort of those around you matters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8eab8de0-165d-11ec-9f3c-48ba0f08f31e" alt="Razer Huntsman v2 with wrist rest" data-uuid="62771dba-3136-31a0-a7f6-eceb43b7f893"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Now the keystrokes are still crisp but instead of hearing a metallic scratching sound it’s more a muffled thud. (You can choose clickier keys at checkout.) And the switches aren’t the only improvement Razer made toward comfort. There’s a larger, squishier wrist rest available at extra cost for those who like having one, which connects to the Huntsman v2 magnetically so you can easily pull it off when it gets in the way — the spacious rest adds another four inches to the 5.5-inch keyboard’s depth.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/deeb2470-165b-11ec-bfcf-5ba7a5216a60" alt="keyboard in black on a blue background" data-uuid="8282331f-cfac-3a58-a2e6-ea1970a6f5a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>However, if you find yourself really crunched for space, Razer is also releasing a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Huntsman TKL" href="https://fave.co/3hF5wqy">$150 tenkeyless version</a> of the Huntsman V2.

It wasn’t the first flagship camera from the company, but I’d argue it was instrumental in bringing the GoPro to the attention of the general public. Back then, the maximum resolution was 1080p, photos topped out at 5-megapixel and it came shrouded in that iconic waterproof housing.</p><p>A decade later, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hero 10 Black" href="https://fave.co/3ClOJjY">Hero 10 Black</a> (revealed today) offers a whopping 5.3K max video resolution, 23-megapixel photos, no longer needs a waterproof housing (for most uses) and has a slew of fancy shooting modes that we couldn’t even have imagined three presidents ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before we get to the review part, though, you likely want to know what else has changed. The headline feature is clearly the new GP2 processor. GoPro started using its homegrown chip, the GP1, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-28-gopro-hero-6-and-gp1.html">a few years ago</a>. Now, the second iteration is here and brings with it a boost in frame-rates across the board (5.3K at 60; 4K at 120 and 2.7K at 240 to name a few).</p><p>Even the front-facing display benefits from an increased frame rate, which should make your previews smoother. GoPro also states that the GP2 brings with it an image processor (ISP) that promises improved quality photos and videos. We’ll be the judge of that, of course.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8bb4ad20-163e-11ec-8f7f-4c5a001d14b2" alt="GoPro Hero 10 review." data-uuid="e38f1f64-56f2-39b2-849c-bbb71a00baf5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>You may have noticed that the max resolution for video is now a shade higher than last year at 5.3K (up from 5). We’re told the sensor is actually the same as before, but that the new chip running the show can eke out more use of it.</p><p>The camera itself is, thankfully, the same dimensions as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-9-black-review-140026287.html">the Hero 9</a> which means if you have a media mod or Hero 9-specific accessory it’ll likely work with the new model just fine. In fact, the only visible differences between last year’s model and the Hero 10 is… the number 10 and the color of the text branding — it’s now GoPro blue rather than gray.</p><h2>GP2 times the power</h2><p>The GP1, GoPro’s first custom processor, made its debut with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-19-gopro-hero-6-review.html">Hero 6 Black</a>. It allowed the company to tightly integrate the brains of the camera with the rest of the hardware and yield more control over key features. With the GP2, the promise is “twice the performance.” The company hasn’t shared specifics about the chip itself, but the rewards are evidenced in the increased frame rates across the board. I already mentioned that the upper-most resolution is now .3 megapixels higher than last time <em>and </em>available at 60fps. Twice the frames of the equivalent on the Hero 9 Black.</p><p>There are other benefits to the new chip beyond FPS, though. Not least, it’s paired with that ISP which we’ll go into in more detail next. The GP2 also powers the updated HyperSmooth 4.0, and promises a slicker user interface and faster offloading of media (again, each of these will get its own section).</p><h2>Image quality</h2><p>While GoPro is touting the new framerate modes as one of the key upgrades this time around, I feel the image quality is worth tackling first — this is a camera after all. The good news is that it’s markedly better than the Hero 9. It’s tempting to assume that the higher resolution for both video and photos is to thank here, but there’s some other processing grunt going on in the background.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/18274db0-164b-11ec-94bd-70bd1b646249" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="a02a9cff-4acf-36eb-89c1-b25671fe2a2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>According to GoPro, new algorithms for tone mapping and noise reduction are also responsible for the bump in quality. All I know is that both videos and photos look better, and in a meaningful way. When I was reviewing my comparison footage, color reproduction was a lot more faithful without looking flat. Somehow natural and inorganic tones (say, buildings and trees) look deeper. On top of that is the fidelity. When I viewed images at 100-percent crop, the difference in detail was instantly obvious. Where some textures, like road surface or leaves, on the Hero 9 can smooth out when they’re not the primary subject of the video, on the Hero 10 you can spot features that aren’t present in last year’s camera.</p><p><strong>Higher resolutions</strong></p><p>On top of the general improvement in image quality is the added flexibility that comes with the new resolution and framerate combinations. The Hero 9 topped out at either 5K/30fps in 16:9 or 4K/30 at 4:3. Not bad. But the Hero 10 offers a pretty substantial increase with 5.3K/30fps or 4K/60 at 4:3 and 5.3K/60 when shooting in 16:9. That’s a lot of jargon, but essentially it means you have a lot more headroom for both 16:9 and 4:3 aspect ratios. And given that 4:3 is great for POV shots, a staple of the action world, that’s good news for your videos.</p><p>It’s easy to wonder why you might even want 5.3K video, given there’s not a lot you can natively play it back on. But more pixels is never a bad thing and you can scale something down to a more “conventional” resolution later or crop to 4K without losing quality. You now even have something close to slow-mo at 4K (60fps) in the 4:3 aspect ratio which is a first for a GoPro.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3faae1f0-1649-11ec-bfff-b143d139678d" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="382e64f6-ff2a-3f4d-8f3a-0fd35c5d8093"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Then, of course, there’s that increase in photo resolution that we already mentioned. Three whole megapixels is a decent improvement from last time around and if you pull stills from video on the regular you’ll enjoy higher resolution there, too (the change varies depending on your video settings, but it’s an increase across the board).</p><p><strong>More frames</strong></p><p>Finally we can get to one of the marquee upgrades: Frame rates. With GP2 onboard, 4K video is now available at 120fps, giving the Hero 10 a respectable slow-mo mode for the first time at UHD. Last year’s camera could eke out 60fps at 4K, but 2X isn’t really enough to show off your laser flips in all their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yRttQvEV1A">mind-boggling glory</a>. The new 4X slow-mo at this high resolution is going to really show off your best moves. The new 120fps mode is available with almost all the field-of-view options, which GoPro calls “lenses,” bar SuperView which tops out at 60fps. 2.7K also gets a boost from 120fps to 240 — the max the camera can do, making this a great balance of resolution and framerate for action.</p><p>Of course, a high frame rate isn’t only about slow-mo, that’s just a common application for it on an action camera. A higher FPS also helps keep your videos looking smooth at normal speed, especially if there’s a lot of activity going on — which, again, seems quite likely with a GoPro. For example, I shot some videos on a bike ride at 4K/30fps and then some more later at 60fps and the sense of motion at the higher frame rate is noticeably much smoother even when played back at normal speed.</p><p>In short, frame rate is another tool in the box when it comes to lining up your shot so it’s great to see far more options here. It also means you don’t have to make a choice between FPS or high resolution nearly as much as you did in the past.</p><h2>HyperSmooth 4.0</h2><p>In a darker age, GoPros had no onboard stabilization. It meant handheld footage had to be shot with extreme care, and every twitch, pothole or wobble was recorded in great clarity. That was fine for some activities, but often it just meant you ended up with unusable footage or a spell in post to try and salvage things.</p><p>Since the Hero 7, we’ve lived in a lighter, brighter world where HyperSmooth would work its magic and make even the most jarring pursuit look slick and smooth on video without having to use a pricey, fragile gimbal. With the Hero 10 we’re now on the fourth revision of GoPro’s onboard stabilizing and it continues to work wonders.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/805ac9e0-1649-11ec-9def-bc82770f7e65" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="bf4a71a4-1d17-341d-8299-45a450f07919"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Perhaps the most notable change here is the increased power of horizon levelling. Before, it would keep videos “flat” to the skyline up to about 27 degrees. After that, it’d gently tilt your video to match the angle of the camera. Now, you can hit a curve or ride a corner at 45-degrees and your video will steadfastly lock to the horizon.</p><p>As with all things, just because you can, doesn’t mean you (always) should. I like using horizon levelling with mounts, selfie sticks or anything that can easily go off-level while holding. In contrast, you <em>could</em> use it while mounted to handlebars, for example, but any tight turns or dramatic leans will get neatly ironed out. You’ll have a smooth video for sure, but it loses a little of the action dynamic. Fortunately, you can decouple horizon levelling from HyperSmooth right on the home screen of the camera so it’s right there when you need it (or don’t).</p><h2>Front screen</h2><p>All new on the Hero 9 was the addition of a front screen for framing yourself when looking at the camera. DJI came out of the gate with one on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-dji-osmo-action-review.html">Osmo Action</a>, beating GoPro to market by weeks. Nonetheless, it’s now a mainstay feature and thus, subject to upgrades, too.</p><p>The one on the Hero 10 is the same size as last year, but with a small increase in frame rate — from 20fps to 30. It’s nice to see the company updating all aspects of the camera, but I personally don’t notice much difference, certainly not at arm&#39;s length, which is most of the time I find myself needing that second display. Either way, if you found the screen a little lacking in this regard, just know that there’s likely a better experience for you this time around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3e86ba0-1649-11ec-9ffe-acd0f2f876a9" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="8a8b4f9d-2de4-3f69-b875-799b5d30f27e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Not so much a feature of the front screen, but it relates to the front, so here is the time to mention it: The Hero 10 now has an “hydrophobic” coating on the lens. If you’ve ever taken a GoPro into the water, you’ll know that drops on the lens are the fastest way to ruin your footage. They normally sit just where the action is taking place, too.</p><p>I haven’t been able to give this camera the full water test yet, but simply getting it wet, you can tell that water doesn’t gather in the large, subject-blurring drips as it did before. It’s not entirely water repellant, but big drops are a thing of the past, instead the worst you get is a collection of smaller droplets. These are still undesirable, but they seem to have less impact on what you’re shooting, so I’ll take it.</p><h2>Faster navigation</h2><p>Another light improvement is in the user interface and menu navigation. GoPro claims the touch screen is now more responsive and most tasks should be quicker. This definitely does appear to be the case. Older cameras sometimes need two (or even three) attempts for a press to be registered, but with the Hero 10 there were far fewer occasions where I found myself needing to tap more than once.</p><p>An even clearer example of the software side of things being more rapid is the amount of time it takes to process an HDR photo. While the exposure is instant, GoPro owners will be familiar with the swirling circles after an image is taken while the camera develops the photo. It’s not long, usually a couple of seconds, but with the Hero 10 that time is about cut in half. Between that and the general nippiness of the menus, the latest flagship definitely feels a little breezier to use.</p><p>One other small usability change that doesn’t technically fit here, but adds to the user experience is that the Hero 10 now allows for good old fashioned wired transfer via a phone. That is, simply connect the camera to your handset you can transfer your media to Quik that way, too.&nbsp;</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Everything has been quite positive so far, so it’s time for a small spanner in the works. Battery life has never really been GoPro&#39;s strong suit, although it has generally improved over time. Alas, the Hero 10 feels like a small step backward. It’s not deal-breaking levels, but on a straight “click record and leave the camera” shoot out, the Hero 9 outlasted the Hero 10 by almost half an hour — clocking in at 1hr40 at 4K/30fps. When I did the same test (with the same actual battery) on the new camera, it only managed 1hr15.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f9944430-1649-11ec-abf7-671b01fb8035" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="a43fa2e4-3d66-359d-a6ca-6783a5d6c41a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>GoPro, for its part, claims that most users are only shooting short videos and it’s optimized the camera (and its battery usage) for that scenario. That might be true, but one must presume that that hasn’t changed since the last camera. And regardless of your shooting habits, the physics of higher processing will always diminish your overall shooting time.</p><p>Things get even worse once you start flirting with those new higher frame rates. On my first day out testing I thought I might have a duff cell as it sunk to about 50-percent battery unusually quickly. It was only later that I confirmed that this is just the price to pay for smoother videos.</p><p>There’s not a lot more to add here, as this is somewhat to be expected: You’re asking a battery of the same capacity to do a lot more work. Let’s hope that future revisions and maybe even some software updates can claim back some of those precious lost minutes.</p><h2>Price</h2><p>Last year, GoPro tried something… different, when it came to pricing. If you bought the camera on its own, it cost $450. That was a little higher than the flagship it replaced (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-gopro-hero-8-black-review.html">the Hero 8</a> sold for $399 at launch). BUT, and it was a big but, if you were willing to sign up for a GoPro subscription at the same time, the total price you paid was $350 — which suddenly felt like a solid deal.</p><p>The same deal is in place this time around, just it’s $50 more expensive. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:camera and subscription bundle" href="https://fave.co/3ClOJjY">camera and subscription bundle</a> now costs $399 and the camera on its own is $499. Given how easy the company is making it for you to get that subscription though — if you have an active subscription already, you’ll get the subscription price — it’s fairly easy to get the lower price. In short, make sure you snag a subscription or already have one when you order.</p><p>Ultimately, the Hero 10 isn’t the cheapest flagship at launch, but neither is it the most expensive — that honor goes to the Hero 6 which cost $499 with no route to pay less. GoPro reduced that price to $400 though soon after launch. It might sting a little that it’s more cost than last year’s, especially if you’d been hoping to get the latest and greatest for the same price, but with general improvements the whole way round it’s likely not something you will dwell on for long — especially as the Hero 9 will retain that $350 price tag along side the Hero 10 as the now “mid-tier” option.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1cd317f0-164a-11ec-96af-402492a10c43" alt="GoPro Hero 10 Black review." data-uuid="f783195c-b71e-3d64-b9e0-91fcd509268e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>For a spell, it looked like DJI was going to maintain the pressure on GoPro with its Osmo Action line. But so far it seems like it’s taking its time when it comes to new models — although you can pick up the original for $200 now, which makes it attractive if price is your main concern. Likewise, Sony seems to have taken its foot off the gas when it comes to refreshing its own, quite popular, line of action cameras. There is, of course, also Insta360, which has gained a solid fan base thanks to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/insta360-go-2-action-cam-minions-bello-banana-140059750.html">unique form-factors</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-insta360-one-r-leica-modular-action-cam.html">modular model</a>.</p><p>It’s a familiar ending here, then. The new camera takes everything that’s working and builds on it. Especially in the areas that matter: Image quality and shooting modes. That’s all we can really ask for. The fact that there are many other usability tweaks is just an added bonus. The apparent dip in battery life, while not ideal, will only really be an issue if you use those new frame rates as standard. As for the price, we’d love for it to have stayed the same as last year’s launch, but the increase isn’t into unrealistic territory.</p><p></p><p><strong>Update:</strong><em>The new cabled connectivity mode is mobile-only, this article has been updated to reflect that.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a786f4f-44d9-4299-9480-c33d8f3d19ee</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631813443</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T17:31:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1340a5b0-163e-11ec-bfe9-460febe0f005" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1340a5b0-163e-11ec-bfe9-460febe0f005" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GoPro Hero 10 review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GoPro Hero 10 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ cleans out its literal and metaphorical closets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains light spoilers for season two, episode six of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>In last week’s episode, <em>Lower Decks</em> wrapped up the first half of its second season by addressing some leftover plot threads from season one, namely Rutherford’s memory loss and the fallout between Mariner and Boimler. With those issues out of the way the series is free to move forward. But first, this week’s “The Spy Humongous” takes some time to look at an average day onboard the <em>USS Cerritos</em>. It’s not quite the <em>TNG</em> classic “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data&#39;s_Day_(episode)">Data&#39;s Day</a>,” but it’s close enough for fans of smaller, more intimate Trek stories.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="208eec755674462da1cbf7ff1fba887d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9vkzjGBAcTM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There’s no strict division between A-plot and B-plot this time, with both upper and lower decks crew starring in four loosely connected stories. The bridge crew is attempting to negotiate a ceasefire with the Pakleds, while the ensigns have been assigned to “anomaly consolidation duty,” which is a fancy way of saying “clearing out weird space junk.” Boimler is thrilled, but he gets pulled away by a group of career-driven “redshirts” who think his time on the <em>USS Titan</em> makes him prime command material. And Ransom ends up babysitting a Pakled defector/tourist/spy. It’s a grab bag of jokes and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html">Star Trek lore</a>, sure to please any long-time Trekkie.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e3815f0-1660-11ec-bffb-f3a5efb6eb4f" data-uuid="c21e5b22-66a5-332d-bec0-92561b028b5b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, it’s still remarkably newcomer friendly, in that it doesn’t require too much background to understand the basic plot, while also illustrating the show’s core concept as a show about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html">nuts and bolts of Starfleet</a>. If this were a live-action show it would be what’s called a “bottle episode,” one shot on a limited budget using pre-built sets and the regular cast. Even on the one exotic locale we’re shown — Pakled Planet — we never actually go inside any buildings. It’s an interesting contrast to last week’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">expansive tour of Starbase 25</a>.</p><p>In live action programming, bottle episodes exist because a show blew through its guest star or special effects budget on a big important story, and “An Embarrassment of Dooplers” would fit that bill. But as I pointed out last week, <em>Lower Decks</em> is not limited by what a set designer can build or how much makeup an actor will wear or how long would it take to render a sentient gaseous anomaly on a green screen. The animators can draw whatever needs to be drawn. So there’s no reason to follow the trope of a bottle episode except that… they want to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bbed5f10-1660-11ec-bdbf-6981a3ba1d37" data-uuid="c8f1724a-cf34-3c1c-a679-b160e9e55ab4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Lower Decks</em> has made no secret that it’s essentially a giant love letter to Star Trek. What was initially predicted to be “<em>Family Guy</em> in space,” ended up treating the franchise with a lot of respect, and was packed full of jokes for the fandom to discuss and catalog in places like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/">Reddit</a> and Trek wiki <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/">Memory Alpha</a>. But this week’s adventure illustrates that attention to Star Trek tropes and backstory can go beyond showcasing little-seen alien species or getting justice for murdered characters.</p><p>It’s also about the love of how Star Trek tells its stories, with a strong emphasis on the personal aspect. Here we get to see Freeman, Mariner and the others simply do their jobs. We know they’re not going to die, especially not mid-season, so it’s really about seeing how they handle adversity and ultimately, what made them Starfleet material in the first place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a369d18c-ef93-4381-a39d-52df1d02ff71</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631799217</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T13:33:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63d9eaa0-1660-11ec-bebf-2681d9f1c493" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63d9eaa0-1660-11ec-bebf-2681d9f1c493" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["The Spy Humongous"  -- Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford, Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner and Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

The company will offer three different wall chargers capable of outputting 20, 30 and 65 watts of power.

Harman&#39;s GaN charger isn&#39;t as powerful, nor does it include as many ports, but at $49.95, you&#39;re still getting a model with interchangeable plugs included. It also comes from a brand that many people trust, and that&#39;s not something you can say about a lot of the more affordable GaN chargers you&#39;ll find through Amazon and other retailers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/harman-infinitylab-charging-accessories-130015354.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85712891-2b0a-4866-ab02-dcfa34fb7a01</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631806972</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T15:42:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3a9926f0-166b-11ec-befe-23334a0ad3d0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3a9926f0-166b-11ec-befe-23334a0ad3d0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Harman]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[InfinityLab GaN 65W charger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[InfinityLab GaN 65W charger]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IKEA's ASUS ROG gaming collection comes to the US and UK this October]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost exactly a year ago, IKEA announced it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-furniture-091759480.html">partnering with ASUS’ Republic of Gamers</a> unit to create an affordable collection of gaming furniture and accessories. After debuting in China and Japan, those products are finally making their way to the US and UK on October 1st.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/37f19320-1656-11ec-bff8-1070db1e1bc3" alt="IKEA accessory stand" data-uuid="5c520301-7dc8-374a-8b57-cee115d11b92"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>The collection is made up of six product families: Uppspel, Lånespelare, Matchspel, Gruppsel, Utespelare and Huvudspelare. Of those, IKEA designed the first one in direct collaboration with ASUS, while the others it created on its own with insights it gleaned from working with the company.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The collection includes everything from furniture like gaming chairs and desks to handy accessories like a mouse bungee and ring light. Pricing starts at $6.49 for the most affordable item, a mouse pad with a polyester top layer, and goes all the way up to $599 for an adjustable gaming desk.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/787bf1b0-1656-11ec-b7f6-29ef6351fa8d" alt="IKEA Uppspel pegboard accessory set" data-uuid="2f2027cc-e22f-3d05-a797-4a76d430b291"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>In practice, some of the items in the collection represent “gamified” versions of existing IKEA products. Take the Uppspel pegboard, for instance. It features the same dimensions as the company’s <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/skadis-pegboard-white-10321618/">Skådis pegboard</a>, but you’ll pay an extra $3 for it because of its more aggressive finish. That&#39;s the kind of upsell that comes with a lot of gaming products (see: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-thunderbolt-4-dock-chroma-030000634.html">every RGB-infused device ever</a>), but most of the collection does live up to IKEA&#39;s affordable billing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-collection-us-uk-october-130003972.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">071c473b-998e-42e6-acd0-b275eca19d00</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631798418</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T13:20:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b18d43b0-16f0-11ec-aed7-aa3439d44946" width="1465" height="896" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b18d43b0-16f0-11ec-aed7-aa3439d44946" width="1465" height="896" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IKEA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The IKEA ASUS ROG gaming collection presented with this wireframe rendering of a high-tech gaming area in someone's home.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IKEA ASUS ROG gaming collection]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
