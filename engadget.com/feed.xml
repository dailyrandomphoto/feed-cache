The bath, which takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing, aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog and aromas. All aspects of the experience can be controlled through Kohler&#39;s Konnect app. The Soak Freestanding Bath model will cost around $8,000 and you&#39;ll be able to order it by the end of March.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5ab62d0-6ca9-11ec-bfe6-274df13e359c" alt="Kohler&#39;s Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas." data-uuid="7b662552-7b9c-3d92-9f3b-4a0d61a022ab"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>Another model offers voice control and another, called the Infinity Experience, fills from the bottom and water overflows into the wood base.

The device will turn or off with a wave of your hand, though you&#39;ll still need to use a physical handle to set your preferred temperature. The faucet will automatically switch off after two minutes and when you set it to Vacation Mode, users can be assured it won&#39;t turn on accidentally while they&#39;re away. The device will ship later this year and cost $199.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9259c90-6ca9-11ec-bfdf-3dac9635110c" alt="The control panel for Kohler&#39;s PerfectFill system, which allows owners to control the depth and temperature of their bath water without monitoring it manually." data-uuid="d56c4fba-64d1-3d8b-8cf9-7f86ddc95181"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, Kohler has announced pricing and availability for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-13-smart-bathrooms-at-ces-2018.html">PerfectFill smart bathing tech</a>. The system allows you to fill your bath to a specified depth and temperature through a voice command, control panel or the Konnect app. You can have up to 10 presets, and you&#39;ll be able to drain the bath using a voice command too. The system — which pairs with a Kohler digital valve, shout and compatible bath — will be available to buy in May, and it starts at $2,700.</p><p>Later this month, Kohler will start shipping home water monitors that it developed with the help of Phyn. The H2Wise systems can monitor water use on every home fixture. Along with alerting homeowners immediately when they detect a leak, the systems will offer detailed insights about home water use. They also use pressure sensing to look for crystals forming in pipes, so they can alert users before pipes freeze and burst.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4002acc0-6caa-11ec-8fff-4a9437db4297" alt="Kohler H2Wise water monitoring system connected to pipes" data-uuid="47464976-4d3e-3f64-81fe-172e74a794c6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>The DIY version (H2Wise) can be installed under a single sink, while the pro model, H2Wise+, is attached to the home&#39;s main valve and can shut off water throughout the residence if it detects a leak. As well as the Kohler app, you can connect the units to voice assistants. The DIY model costs approximately $400, and Kohler says the pro version (which can also be used outdoors) will be an estimated $666.70.</p><p>Among the other products Kohler will release this year is the Power Reserve Energy Storage System, which can pair with solar panel systems to store energy they produce. The battery can act as a backup for outages or to power the home using stored solar energy and reduce dependence on utility power. You can also prioritize the use of stored energy during peak usage times to lower the cost of your utility bills.</p><p>There could be a benefit for homes that don&#39;t have solar panels, as the system can store energy from the power grid at times of lower electricity usage. Kohler Power Reserve will start at around $13,325 for a system with a 10 kWh battery capacity, though you can have up to 20 kWh.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kohler-stillness-bath-pricing-availability-hands-free-faucet-home-energy-storage-155808475.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44bdb3fd-508c-4857-a056-b5a56b6ee821</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:58:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641226696</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T16:18:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kohler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kohler's Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kohler Stillness Bath]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag is the cheapest it's ever been at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s AirTags can be a good way to keep track of that new backpack or wallet you were gifted during the holidays, and now you can grab one of the trackers for less. Amazon has a single <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirTag" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ">AirTag</a> for $24, which is $5 less than usual and a new record-low. The only time we&#39;ve seen AirTags for less than this was during a Woot sale on a four-pack. This, however, is the best price we&#39;ve seen if you want just one of the trackers — and while it&#39;s a relatively small discount, it&#39;s a good deal on an accessory that rarely goes on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ" id="e0c890e637b1452882acc1322a6ad312" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirTag at Amazon - $24</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are designed to work with iPhones, which means you&#39;ll get a pretty seamless experience from the moment you take the coin-sized tracker out of the box. The Find My app will immediately recognize the AirTag and you can label it with the name of whatever it&#39;s attached to. Since there&#39;s no keyhole on the AirTag, you will need some sort of case or holder if you want to secure the tracker to your keys, but you can find <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">affordable AirTag accessories</a> easily across the web. Given how small AirTags are, they&#39;ll easily slip into a pocket of your bag or a fold in your wallet without trouble.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once set up, you can return to the Find My app to locate your missing things and you can force the AirTag to emit a chime so you can more easily find your stuff if you&#39;re still relatively close to it. Plus, if you have an iPhone that supports ultra-wideband, the AirTag&#39;s Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your stuff with directions on your handset&#39;s screen. You may have to wait a bit to get the AirTag as Amazon&#39;s estimated delivery time is at the end of January, but now&#39;s a good opportunity to add an AirTag to your Apple setup and save a bit of money while doing so.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c56f72ad-cab7-435d-95a5-21e94204094d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:38:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641224301</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's workout-ready Elite 4 Active earbuds are now available for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">Jabra debuted</a> its ultra affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Elite 3</a> earbuds. That model offers all of the core features you&#39;d expect from a set of true wireless earbuds with good sound quality, solid battery life and a comfy fit. And all of that only costs you $80. There were some omissions — most notably the lack of active noise cancellation (ANC) — but the company is officially debuting a new option at CES that checks even more boxes while keeping the price low: <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">the Elite 4 Active</a>.</p><p>While these earbuds <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">made an early appearance</a> in the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-wireless-earbuds-142911217.html">last week</a>, Jabra <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jabra-boosts-new-years-fitness-resolutions-with-new-jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-301452531.html">has now officially announced</a> the new set for the US. The Elite 4 Active features a similar design to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">the range of new earbuds</a> the company began announcing last year. This means the buds should be comfy due to their smaller size and recently redesigned shape. As the name implies, the Elite 4 Active is built to withstand sweaty workouts with an IP57 waterproof rating.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4c75d991-0fbc-4640-923b-11d3954bc63d"/><p>In terms of audio, the Elite 4 Active houses 6mm drivers and you can tweak the EQ via Jabra&#39;s app. This new model also features ANC, which the more affordable Elite 3 does not. The only caveat is that it&#39;s not adjustable like the noise cancellation on the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a> earbuds. Jabra&#39;s transparency mode, HearThrough, is available on the Elite 4 Active to allow you to hear your surroundings when needed. Four mesh covered microphones assist with calls and Jabra says their design will reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Elite 3, you can expect up to seven hours of battery life with an additional three charges in the case. Jabra has also included features like the ability to use either earbud solo, Google Fast Pair, Alexa built-in and Spotify Tap playback. The best part?

It has a minimalist design, a lovely 7-inch display, clearer and louder audio than its predecessor and faster performance as well. It&#39;s just the right size to fit into any room without taking up too much space, and you can even place it on your nightstand and it will track your sleep. The feature was a bit finicky when we tested it, but as long as it&#39;s place precisely, you should get data on your sleep duration, quality, schedule and even snoring information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nest Audio is Google&#39;s $100 smart speaker that competes with Amazon&#39;s Echo and Apple&#39;s HomePod mini. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">holds its own</a> against both of those devices and it earned a score of 87 from us for its solid audio quality, charming design, good Google Assistant performance and stereo mode when two of the speakers are paired. It&#39;s the smart speaker to get if you care at all about audio quality and already rely on the Google Assistant a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Mini</a> may seem like an attractive option at $25, but you get what you pay for. Like its Amazon counterpart, the Echo Dot, the Nest Mini is an affordable way to get the Google Assistant into a small place but you&#39;ll sacrifice quite a bit on sound quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> is for those who want to go all in on both sound and Google smart devices. It has the best audio quality of them all plus a 10-inch display, gesture controls and the ability to double as a Nest Cam. It would make a good home-base smart display, one that sits in your living room or kitchen so everyone in your family has access to it when necessary.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-drops-to-60-in-new-years-sale-144818377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa6e7d7c-f270-4d20-bae9-a70f478d7b72</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 14:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221303</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:48:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub 2021 (2nd gen) photo.

The price only appears on the product page if you&#39;re a Prime subscriber, but it&#39;s available for all and it will show up once you have the game in your cart.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31jevsm" id="af4d3c5a87d7429bb047e10a2d3d0dc8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ring Fit Adventure at Amazon - $55</a><p>Designed to work with the Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-ring-fit-adventure-winter-workout.html"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a> tracks motion using the console&#39;s Joy-Cons. One straps to the provided ring while the other attaches to a leg strap so it can keep track of both upper- and lower-body movements. Like regular games that don&#39;t have a sneaky exercise component, you&#39;ll design your character when you first boot up the title and they&#39;ll immediately be plopped into a new world that&#39;s ready to be explored. Only here, you&#39;ll do so by running in place and completing exercises like leg lifts and crunches to defeat enemies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> won&#39;t replicate a treadmill run or even a strength-training workout video you can follow along, but that&#39;s ultimately the point of an exercise-based game like this. It&#39;s designed to provide a unique workout that doesn&#39;t feel like a regular fitness routine. We also appreciate that the game targets all part of the body with the moves it asks you to do, and you can customize it a bit by choosing the exercises you want to run through. There&#39;s also a handy &quot;quiet mode&quot; that removes actions like jumping up and down and instead focuses on lower-impact moves.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-ring-fit-adventure-is-back-on-sale-for-55-135758105.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">611479af-ca2c-4793-aa1f-45c90a318a21</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:57:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641218283</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T13:58:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tech that helps with those New Year’s resolutions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new year.

As part of her <a href="https://www.regeringen.dk/nyheder/2022/statsminister-mette-frederiksens-nytaarstale/">New Year’s Address</a>, she said that (translated) “by 2025, Danes must have the opportunity to fly green on a domestic route.” She added that “by 2030 at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” It was part of a broader commitment by the leader to toughen measures against polluters and to jump-start the country’s green transition.</p><p>There are, however, reasons to be concerned that such an ambitious deadline can be reached, given the lack of ready alternatives. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">Electric planes may never succeed</a>, and hydrogen flying, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">while much more promising</a>, is nowhere near ready to be rolled out to a major airline’s fleet. Not to mention, of course, that only hydrogen produced as a result of electrolysis, powered by excess renewable energy, can be called truly “green.” <a href="https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article12437427.ece"><em>EnergiWatch</em></a> has said that Denmark’s standing policy of waiting for magic bullet technologies to come to fruition is not going to help it reach its international commitments on climate emissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Denmark has made more steps than some countries to help make the transition toward zero-carbon technologies. The country has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-to-end-offshore-oil-gas-pumping-by-2050-162837374.html">issued a hard deadline</a> to end oil and gas exploration and is a big player in the wind power industry. At the start of 2021, it committed to build an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-energy-island-north-sea-wind-power-140022879.html">artificial island</a> which could collect and store power from Denmark’s wind farms, enough to supply 10GW. At the same time, the country hopes that any excess wind power can be used to drive an electrolyzer, helping it develop a nice sideline as a producer of guilt-free Hydrogen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/denmark-pledges-green-domestic-flights-by-2030-101536240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2001297e-d119-458d-92eb-567c9196dd9d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641202848</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T09:40:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbus A320 SAS Airlines.

That&#39;s the basic idea behind Alienware&#39;s Concept Nyx, a server that&#39;s powerful enough to run all of your games throughout your home network. Think of it like Plex for gaming, but instead of opening up your video library, it&#39;s all about bringing your games to all of your devices.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="54ce5d27-bc2d-4b74-b9be-83a73968f1f9"/><p>Given the push toward game streaming  from Google Stadia and Xbox, Alienware may have stumbled on an interesting solution for multi-gamer homes. You could conceivably run two games at once on your television, as we saw during a recent demo in NYC. Or you could play <em>Cyberpunk</em> while someone else perfects their <em>Rocket League</em> skills on another device. Since all of the rendering and network processing is happening in your home, Nyx would also be a lower latency experience than traditional cloud gaming, which relies on servers hundreds of miles away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Concept</em> is the key word here, though. Alienware representatives wouldn&#39;t tell us what&#39;s powering the mysterious Nyx server, which looked like an enormous gaming desktop. And while my colleague Cherlynn Low and I were able to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> simultaneously on a single TV, the games were running in tiny windows. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near the sleek half-screen experience Dell is showing off in promotional pictures.</p><p>Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ufo-portable-gaming-pc.html">Alienware&#39;s Concept UFO</a>, a Switch-like portable gaming PC that was first demoed two years ago, Nyx may never see the light of day. But we could see elements of it in future products, much like the way the UFO controller is being used demonstrate Nyx. The game server concept could eventually simplify streaming from your rig. That&#39;s something we can already do with Steam&#39;s Remote Play feature, but perhaps Dell could make it a bit easier to play all of your titles throughout your home. The company says it&#39;s also exploring ways to run four games at once, as well as methods of collecting all of your titles, no matter where you installed them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20402-6989-11ec-b3f5-e7fa8bacb0d1" alt="Alienware Concept Nyx UFO Controller" data-uuid="b80a62dd-a72b-3174-822f-6e3966d29f38"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-concept-nyx-game-server-050141873.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87304ad2-084a-465a-8503-1128f18f48ea</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 05:01:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221515</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is putting NFTs in its smart TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given that 2021 was a blockbuster year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-products-and-companies-2021-143005186.html">for NFTs</a>, it’s not particularly surprising that major tech companies are incorporating Non-Fungible Tokens into their CES lineup.

To start, the mainstream Neo QLED sets now include what <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> says are the first 4K and 8K sets with 144Hz inputs instead of the usual 120Hz. The extra fluidity won&#39;t be immediately useful when even the fastest PCs struggle with high-speed 4K and 8K content, but you won&#39;t have to worry about your premium TV becoming obsolete any time soon.</p><p>The TVs promise image quality improvements regardless of the source. All the 8K and 4K Neo QLED sets have jumped from a 12-bit backlight to 14-bit, providing more accurate brightness. They also boast a new Shape Adaptive Light Control feature that theoretically improves the mini-LED sets&#39; quality, and an AI-driven Object Depth Enhancer can help distinguish a picture&#39;s main subject from its background.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Software plays an important role as well. All the 2022 Samsung TVs have a new home screen that helps aggregate streaming content and offers an ambient display when idle. A Gaming Hub can directly launch console- and cloud-based games, while a new Game Bar helps you customize relevant picture settings. Watch Together is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">SharePlay</a>-style mode that lets you talk to distant friends while you watch broadcasts and streaming shows. And since this is 2022, you can even shop for and display <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f01be3d0-6c17-11ec-9bfb-c507f83e0a49" alt="Samsung MicroLED TV (2022)" data-uuid="7c0958fc-917b-35cc-bf81-3a0921d582b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Other sets have their own share of upgrades. Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-microled-tvs-ces-160052013.html">MicroLED line</a> (shown at middle) is now bezel-free, so your giant luxury TV should blend more seamlessly with your decor. They also tout a 10 percent wider color range, and you can buy a &#39;small&#39; 89-inch preconfigured set if the 99- and 110-inch variants won&#39;t quite fit. And if the bezels are precisely what you want, 2022 The Frame (below) sets now have more canvas-like matte displays and a fresh art store interface.</p><p>As is often the case, Samsung hasn&#39;t provided availability and price ranges as of this writing. The Frame will be available in sizes between 32 and 85 inches, though, and you can presume both 8K screens and MicroLED models will carry stiff premiums. It&#39;s too soon to say whether they&#39;ll compete well against rival models <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html">from LG</a>, Sony and other brands. With that said, it&#39;s evident Samsung still isn&#39;t in a rush to embrace OLED TVs and counter its best-known challengers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55cd5e20-6c18-11ec-9998-1be77eca943e" alt="Samsung The Frame TV (2022)" data-uuid="fb4af850-3b71-33ce-acc0-553207405fe1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e48f21dd-628f-4403-9cd1-46dee26e1ad1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 02:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221189</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:46:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is baking Stadia and GeForce Now into its TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung" href="https://fave.co/31Ygak3">Samsung</a> is overhauling its TV interface, and it&#39;s looking to pull many of your gaming needs together in one place.

As users discovered, Exchange was trying to store version date checks for its antivirus scanning engine in a 32-bit integer variable — a big problem when any date from January 1st, 2022 onward was too large.

The timing is also &#39;ideal&#39; as a holiday weekend likely limited the demand for email.

As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860029/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-4k-smartthings-iot-workspace-game-home">notes</a>, the company is starting things off with the Smart Monitor M8. The 32-inch 4K display offers TV functionality <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unveils-a-43-inch-version-of-its-tv-like-smart-monitors-075604949.html">like its predecessors</a>, but now includes a SmartThings hub to control compatible smart home devices directly from your screen. It&#39;s also better-suited for video chats thanks to an included magnetic SlimFit webcam you can use with Google Duo and other apps.</p><p>The M8 can also serve as a platform for (as yet unnamed) game streaming services, complete with wireless gamepad support. More details are coming closer to launch, Samsung said. Workspace also folds Microsoft 365 and other cloud productivity services into a single space.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung hasn&#39;t mentioned pricing or a release date for the Smart Monitor M8. While it&#39;s smaller than the 43-inch M7 (normally $600), the smart home features and webcam could keep the price relatively high.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f30d6f0-6c0b-11ec-9daf-32d24dddfedb" alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 curved gaming monitor" data-uuid="43258947-8dc1-355b-bbad-91643baba057"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The other display might cost less than previous models, however. Samsung has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs">unveiled</a> a 32-inch Odyssey Neo G8 gaming monitor that should be far smaller than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html">49-inch Neo G9</a> while preserving the pronounced 1000R curve, mini-LED technology, 240Hz refresh rate and 2,000-nit peak brightness. It even jumps to a 4K resolution — this is the first 4K monitor to support 240Hz and a 1ms pixel response time, Samsung claimed. Support for both NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync and AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium Pro should keep tearing artifacts to a minimum.</p><p>There&#39;s no mention of a price or ship date for the Odyssey Neo G8. Given the size reduction, it won&#39;t be surprising if the screen costs less than the $2,500 G9 even with the resolution bump.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-odyssey-neo-g8-204612785.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10951aa1-6f66-4641-aed8-b2e23c8e234d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 20:46:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221171</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:46:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c194dee0-6c08-11ec-bbf4-c12cfcf9e9bd" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c194dee0-6c08-11ec-bbf4-c12cfcf9e9bd" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Smart Monitor M8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Smart Monitor M8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T and Verizon reject US call to delay 5G expansions over interference]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon aren&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-5g-expansion-delay-faa-pete-buttigieg-224552929.html">delaying their 5G expansions</a> any further after all. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service?sref=10lNAhZ9">notes</a> the two carriers&#39; CEOs have issued a joint letter rejecting a request from the FAA and Transportation Department to stall their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">C-band service rollouts</a> beyond January 5th to address concerns of interference with aircraft systems. The companies argued that the government&#39;s proposed plan would effectively give oversight of the network expansions to the FAA for an &quot;undetermined number of months or years,&quot; and wouldn&#39;t cover rivals like T-Mobile.</p><p>The move would represent an &quot;irresponsible abdication&quot; of network control, the CEOs said. They also believed honoring the request would be to the &quot;detriment&quot; of customers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead, AT&amp;T and Verizon tried to negotiate a compromise. They vowed not to deploy C-band 5G towers near some airports for six months, but only so long as the aviation industry and regulators didn&#39;t do more to halt C-band deployments. American transportation agencies had asked on December 31st for a general delay no longer than two weeks, but called for a gradual deployment of service near &quot;priority&quot; airports through March to safeguard important runways.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear how the FAA and Transportation Department will respond. The rejection isn&#39;t shocking, mind you. C-band service promises to deliver more of the long-touted speed advantages of 5G without the short range and poor indoor service of millimeter wave technology. It could also add capacity to keep 5G networks running smoothly as more users upgrade their devices. However, officials and the aviation industry have a lot to lose as well —they&#39;re worried C-band 5G could disrupt flights and put passengers at risk. You might not see either side capitulate quickly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-reject-us-5g-c-band-delay-191634365.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2c18d09-3330-4693-9c5d-36b4a145af7f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 19:16:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641150999</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T19:17:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/6592a650-5501-11eb-9feb-aa635a78297e" width="5100" height="3400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/6592a650-5501-11eb-9feb-aa635a78297e" width="5100" height="3400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Education Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Side by side ATT and Verizon store fronts and entrances at a mall in northern Idaho.

The company has <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries">revealed</a> that it delivered 936,172 electric cars in 2021, about 308,600 of them in the fourth quarter. While that isn&#39;t the magic 1 million figure the company might have hoped for, it&#39;s close — and nearly double the 499,550 Tesla handed to customers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-transformative-fourth-quarter-tops-a-full-year-of-positive-revenue-000902903.html">in 2020</a>.</p><p>The year gone by wasn&#39;t stellar for the Model S and Model X.

By further improving the audio quality, apparently. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/02/kuo-airpods-pro-2-to-offer-lossless-support-new-form-factor-more/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims Apple is launching its second-generation AirPods Pro in the fall with support for Apple Lossless (ALAC) audio. There&#39;s no mention of support for other lossless formats, unfortunately, but the rumored upgrade would at least ensure you could listen to Apple Music (and locally stored ALAC songs) without compromising on quality.</p><p>Kuo also expects the updated AirPods Pro to offer a &quot;new form factor design.&quot; You might not have to worry quite so much if you lose your earbuds, either — they&#39;ll supposedly include a charging case that can make sounds, much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a>. You might only have to &#39;ping&#39; your buds to find them on the sidewalk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain if or how Apple would support its lossless format given Bluetooth&#39;s data pipe limitations. However,  company acoustics VP Gary Geaves recently told <em>What Hi-Fi</em> in an <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/is-bluetooth-holding-back-apples-airpods-we-asked-the-man-who-made-them">interview</a> that his team would &quot;like more bandwidth,&quot; teasing the possibility of new technology. Apple won&#39;t necessarily augment or replace wireless standards like Bluetooth, but it could develop an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html">aptX Lossless</a>-style codec to make wireless ALAC viable.</p><p>However accurate Kuo might be, we wouldn&#39;t count on lossless support just yet. The purported launch is still several months away, and Apple might cancel or delay plans. With that said, an upgrade strategy like this would make sense. While the AirPods Pro still have advantages like active noise cancellation and silicone eartips, the latest standard AirPods are much closer in terms of sound quality and features (like spatial audio) while offering longer battery life. The currently Pros are only truly a good value when you can find them on sale. Lossless music, a new design and a smarter case could help justify a higher price.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-support-rumor-152945692.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7817ecb5-f57d-44cb-b353-126ea17c01c2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 15:29:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641137388</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T15:30:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/0cf63c10-af5b-11ea-b47d-2898c24eade1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/0cf63c10-af5b-11ea-b47d-2898c24eade1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T and Verizon might delay 5G expansion again over FAA concerns]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past month, AT&amp;T and Verizon have been holding off on rolling out potentially faster <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">C-band 5G service</a>, due to safety concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration. Now, it looks like an additional delay could be in store, once again over FAA concerns. The two major carriers had been scheduled on December 5 to use newly purchased frequencies to roll out C-band service, but delayed the launch to January 5 after the Department of Transportation raised concerns related to possible interference. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/">a letter obtained by <em>Reuters</em></a>, the Transportation Department and FAA are now asking for up to two more weeks to study the issue.</p><p>In the letter, sent by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to the CEOs of AT&amp;T and Verizon, the pair asked for a delay of &quot;no more than two weeks.&quot; The two framed the request as part of a &quot;proposal as a near-term solution for advancing the co-existence of 5G deployment in the C-Band and safe flight operations,&quot; according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At issue until now has been the possibility that pilots will use poor-weather safety system that could conflict with this new C-band 5G technology. The FAA would ultimately like to enact regulations that bar pilots from using such systems, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></a>reported in November. Aviation officials have claimed that C-band 5G has the potential to interfere with flights in and around the nearly four dozen cities where C-band towers are located. Telecoms have claimed there is no evidence that C-band 5G will jeopardize flight safety.</p><p>In the framework that <em>Reuters</em> describes in its report, the FAA would designate &quot;priority&quot; airports where &quot;a buffer zone would permit aviation operations to continue safely while the FAA completes its assessments of the interference potential.&quot;</p><p><em>Reuters</em> says that both companies say they have received the letter. But they have so far stopped short of agreeing to an additional two-week delay. Needless to say, this postponement would come as unwelcome news to both carriers. <em>Reuters</em> reports that on Friday, the companies accused the aviation industry of holding the C-band expansion &quot;hostage until the wireless industry agrees to cover the costs of upgrading any obsolete altimeters.&quot;</p><p>And in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1">a statement to <em>Insider</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>on Saturday, a Verizon spokesperson said: &quot;If the airlines are so concerned about flight cancellations related to 5G, they should really look at their track record over the past two weeks,&quot; referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/business/flights-cancelled.html">a wave of recent cancellations</a> amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. &quot;This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.&quot;</p><p>As frustrated as executives from the two carriers might be, however, as <em>Reuters</em> notes the companies agreed to six months of precautionary measures when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">purchased the C-band spectrum in early 2021</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-5g-expansion-delay-faa-pete-buttigieg-224552929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1405672b-47ec-4ea7-8635-84b2e907ab3a</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 22:45:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641076394</ingested><modified>2022-01-01T22:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b3c34c50-6b4c-11ec-bfe6-4e7b8e89fa5d" width="4774" height="3235" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b3c34c50-6b4c-11ec-bfe6-4e7b8e89fa5d" width="4774" height="3235" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GEORGE FREY via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOPSHOT - A contract crew for Verizon, works on a cell tower to update it to handle the new 5G network in Orem, Utah on December 10,  2019. - The new 5G cellular network will substantially increase cellular network speeds, opening up new markets for business and individuals.
