The cryptocurrency exchange told the publication that its security team observed a large-scale phishing campaign targeting its users between April and early May 2021. Some users may have fallen victim to the malicious emails, giving hackers access to their usernames and passwords. Worse, even those who had multi-factor authentication switched on were compromised because of a flaw in the exchange&#39;s system.</p><p>In the <a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/21073975/09-24-2021-coinbase-customer-notification.pdf">notification</a> [PDF] it sent to affected customers, Coinbase said the bad actors took advantage of a vulnerability in its SMS Account Recovery process.

Back in August, Coinbase also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-2fa-settings-notification-error-191730314.html">notified</a> 125,000 users that their two-factor settings had changed, but the exchange said back then that the notification was sent by mistake and wasn&#39;t the result of a hack.</p><p>In its letter to customers, Coinbase said it patched up its SMS Account Recovery protocols as soon as it learned about the issue. It&#39;s also reimbursing everyone who&#39;s lost cryptocurrency from the event. Those who were affected by the hack may want to make sure all their other accounts are secure, though, since it also exposed their names, addresses and other sensitive information when their accounts were infiltrated.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/coinbase-hack-mfa-exploit-102924471.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b515178d-74f2-45b8-b6a2-9bc7008adcd7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 10:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633170606</ingested><modified>2021-10-02T10:30:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[dulezidar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ljubljana, Slovenia - may 14 Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency close up shoot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US will bring together 30 countries to tackle ransomware]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Biden administration plans to bring together 30 countries later this month to discuss the threat ransomware attacks pose to global economic and national security.

After announcing the Plex mobile-first bank accounts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-scrapping-its-plan-to-offer-bank-accounts-to-users-11633104001">in November last year with Citibank</a> and a few other financial institutions, Google is pulling back from the product. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-scrapping-its-plan-to-offer-bank-accounts-to-users-11633104001">the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the company is &quot;abandoning plans to pitch bank accounts to its users.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>A Google spokesperson told Engadget that it&#39;s &quot;updating our approach to focus primarily on delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Plex was initially positioned as an easy mobile-first way to open bank accounts, with Google providing the technology and app design and banks and credit providers backing the finances. It sounded more like a way to help institutions that didn&#39;t yet have a modern, competent app to team up with Google on one, which might be why major names like Bank of America and Capital One, who already had existing apps, weren&#39;t on the list of partners.</p><p>According to the <em>Journal</em>, a Citibank spokesperson said it plans to recommend other accounts to people who had already signed up for the Plex waiting list. The publication reports that the waiting list numbered about 400,000 people, and that the pandemic had thrown plans off schedule. The <em>Journal</em> also noted that &quot;As late as this week, several banks were under the impression that the project would still move forward.&quot;</p><p>Though the Plex branding is going away, Google does appear to want to stick around in the financial services business. The spokesperson said that &quot;We strongly believe that this is the best way for Google to help consumers gain better access to financial services and to help the financial services ecosystem connect more deeply with their customers in a digital environment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It may not a complete abandonment, but Plex joins a <a href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">long list of other Google products that were cancelled</a> or discontinued, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-officially-retiring-the-home-max-222304710.html">Home Max speaker</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-16-google-discontinues-clips-camera.html">Clips camera</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-02-rip-google-plus.html">Google+</a> and more.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rip-google-plex-201026848.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73d9d328-6dee-4f42-add7-9f5f282a62b6</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 20:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633120453</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T20:34:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a5e87690-22f5-11ec-abff-40243e3f87db" width="700" height="441" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7d2659c0-22f5-11ec-a5bb-3210f0bb42db" width="700" height="368" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google / Citibank]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pay / Citibank]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pay / Citibank]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW’s iX SUV sets the automaker on the correct EV path]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="ed09857e054d4e0b82142676785fda07"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dy1BJnvAHOU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>You have to look past the grille of the iX. Just accept it for what it is or ignore it all together because that polarizing piece of design that actually doesn’t feed a radiator like it does the gas-powered X5. Instead it has a few sensors and it’s really a design feature. But look past it because behind it is BMW’s fifth-generation EV system, which is actually great.</p><p>While the inside of the iX carries the torch of the now-discontinued i3, the limitations of that vehicle, namely its short range, are gone. The iX starting at $83,200 has a targeted range of about 300 miles. Beyond the design, it handles and drives like a next-generation EV with a plethora of features that’ll make first adopters and those migrated from the gas-powered BMWs happy.

It can travel at a maximum speed of just over six miles per hour, though it’s possible to throttle it down to one mile per hour. Some of the more nifty features of the C+walk include an obstacle avoidance system. It will beep when it detects something on your path and slow down the vehicle if a collision is imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Initially, the automaker envisions the scooter helping elderly workers travel across large facilities like warehouses, factories and airport terminals. In the future, the company hopes the Japanese government will certify the C+walk for use on public roads. Toyota dealers in Japan will start selling and leasing the scooter at the start of next month. It will start at ¥341,000, or just under $3,100 with the current exchange rate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-c-plus-walk-electric-scooter-announcement-183005391.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a6114ef-c9b4-4536-8dd3-a7ca475db635</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 18:45:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633112810</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T18:26:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ef2d6f0-22e3-11ec-9ff7-aa23210b0383" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ef2d6f0-22e3-11ec-9ff7-aa23210b0383" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[C+walk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[C+walk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15 update to fix Apple Watch unlock bug is here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve had your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html">iPhone set up to unlock with your Apple Watch</a> and recently upgraded to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">an iPhone 13</a>, a software bug may have prevented you from continuing to use this.

This feature later got broken with a subsequent iOS and update and required <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-7-1-apple-watch-unlock-with-iphone-fix-191917256.html">another over-the-air package</a> to fix. Apple recently acknowledged that this was also not working on some iPhone 13 models, and said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-iphone-13-unlock-bug-fix-174529852.html">would roll out a solution soon</a>. The iPhone 13 only started being available on September 24th, so this issue was at least caught early. Though it&#39;s nice that the update is here days later, it&#39;s interesting to see the trouble the company has had with this feature in the last few months.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-fix-watch-unlock-bug-182431259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7b15730-79da-4f1b-9fa3-37cf7d125a78</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 18:24:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633112673</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T18:24:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The iPhone 13 Pro, held face up in a person's hand, with the iOS 15 home screen in view.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome is testing a feature that groups pages you visit by topic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chrome"><ins>Google Chrome</ins></a> is <a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/10/helping-users-explore-web-and-continue.html"><ins>experimenting</ins></a> with a couple of features that could help you continue research into a topic and compare the page you&#39;re on with other search results.

Even the name, <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em>, feels like a big subtweet at Snap. But despite its head start, Spectacles have yet to be a big hit for the company. And, with a $300 price tag and Facebook’s name on the box, Ray-Ban Stories may also prove to be a difficult sell.</p><p>Both Spectacles and Ray-Ban Stories represent something much bigger to the social media companies that made them. Snapchat and Facebook are hoping to define the future of augmented reality, and are betting that camera-enabled sunglasses will help them get there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But look closely, and the companies have taken very different approaches. While Ray-Ban Stories look pretty close to regular Wayfarers, Spectacles have never looked like a typical pair of sunglasses. Snapchat has also been more ambitious about integrating its augmented reality effects into the glasses. And the company recently began experimenting with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html">new set</a> of Specs that are capable of real AR, though they aren’t for sale.</p><p>Non-AR “smart glasses” are still a niche product, but Ray-Ban Stories might be one of the best iterations yet. The frames make it easy to capture first-person photos and videos, and the built-in speakers sound surprisingly good. Most importantly, they look more like designer sunglasses than a piece of tech. But Facebook’s reputation is hard to ignore, especially when you’re wearing a camera it designed <em>on your actual face</em>.</p><p>But if you’re excited about the future of augmented reality, and what one day might be possible, both Ray-Ban Stories and Spectacles offer an intriguing look at how two of the biggest social media platforms are thinking about getting there.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-vs-snapchat-spectacles-173247974.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a52f0a3-385a-42a0-bc16-5146af0ea21b</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 17:32:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633111149</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T17:59:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4d223640-22dc-11ec-afbd-2a127c1a9082" width="1920" height="1130" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b0a5d410-22dc-11ec-b6e1-bb1ae0ad1bdc" width="1920" height="1130" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ray-Ban Stories Wayfarer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ray-Ban Stories Wayfarer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NOAA's surfing drone captured footage inside Hurricane Sam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/world-first-ocean-drone-captures-video-from-inside-hurricane"><ins>shared</ins></a> what it says are the first images and video captured inside a hurricane by a surface <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/drone"><ins>drone</ins></a>.

As part of Microsoft’s recent <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/01/xbox-celebrates-disability-community/"><ins>Xbox Accessibility Showcase</ins></a>, the studio detailed the lengths it went to make that vision a reality. The included accessibility options that will come with <em>Halo Infinite</em> don’t look as comprehensive as they were in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-accessibility-225557288.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us Part II</ins></em></a>, but they come close.</p><p>For example, in addition to the usual UI and subtitle options you find in many other games, <em>Halo Infinite</em> will include a feature called Linear Navigation. You can enable it to move through the user interface without the need to see how controls are positioned on the screen. Another new enhancement called Movement Assisted Steering allows you to use additional controls to steer vehicles if the traditional look-to-steer mechanic isn’t doing it for you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside of those, there are options that allow you to tweak the colors of friendlies and enemies beyond the usual red and blue. Another setting lets players enable menu narration, and adjust the reading speed of the feature. It’s also possible to enable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-party-chat-previews-text-to-speech-and-speech-transcription-102644434.html"><ins>text-to-speech and speech-to-text</ins></a> tools to make party chat more accessible. The included options probably won&#39;t cover every accessibility need, but they should help make <em>Halo Infinite </em>playable for a much broader group of people when the game comes out on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html">December 8th</a>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>During the same showcase, Microsoft announced it adding introducing accessibility tags to the Microsoft Store on Xbox. At launch, there will be 20 of these tags, with the company planning to add more with time. Each one will denote a specific accessibility feature.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the currently available tags include “Narrated Game Menus,” “Input Remapping” and Single Stick Gameplay.” Each one comes with specific implementation requirements. For instance, in the case of a developer that wants to point to the subtitle support in their title, they’ll need to allow players to resize them by up to 200 percent. Members of the Xbox Accessibility Insiders League (XAIL) will see the tags appear in the Microsoft Store starting today. In the coming months, the feature will roll out to Xbox.com, the Xbox app on PC and Xbox Game Pass apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-accessibility-options-170337824.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415ce744-f908-43d6-9b66-bbc982dfee75</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 17:03:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633107821</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T17:03:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c53eb100-cd2b-11eb-bfed-85167524c160" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c53eb100-cd2b-11eb-bfed-85167524c160" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft / 343 Industries]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Halo Infinite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Halo Infinite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discord retires the discovery interface for its Clubhouse-like audio broadcasts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discord says <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-channels-203930584.html">Stage Channels</a> is a hit, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-discovery-150006746.html">Stage Discovery</a> platform that was designed to make it easier to find servers with live speakers still needs a lot of work.

Discord also recently rolled out Scheduled Events for Stage, which allows users to plan events ahead of time so they can reach more potential attendees.</p><div id="810d5fdbb1324f999cb8f02dcd18a0f0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UC0Cebf0xv8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/discord-stage-discovery-portal-170039853.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7006aa35-2540-43b3-9c89-6536c781ff10</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 17:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633088908</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T11:48:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/8f8bc5f0-b35b-11eb-bf7f-d64b3e6be214" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/8f8bc5f0-b35b-11eb-bf7f-d64b3e6be214" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Discord]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Discord Stage Discovery]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Discord Stage Discovery]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Office 2021 starts at $150 and arrives on October 5th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#39;s software suite is getting an upgrade on October 5th with the rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html">Windows 11</a>, and this includes Office Home and Student 2021, and Office Home and Business 2021.

That’s why we actively advocate for policies that promote clean energy, increase access to renewable electricity, and decarbonize the transportation system. In addition to advocating for these issues on a local, state, and international level, we have a worldwide sustainability team that innovates sustainable solutions for both our business and customers, as well as co-founded The Climate Pledge - a commitment to be net-zero carbon 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Amazon has made bold commitments to reduce our carbon emissions, and we continue to encourage other companies to join us. We support investments in the Infrastructure and Build Back Better bills to lower emissions in key sectors like energy and transportation, and we believe these investments will help advance America’s carbon reduction goals. As we said earlier this year, we support an increase in the corporate tax rate to pay for things like infrastructure, and we look forward to Congress and the administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Update 1/10 12:22PM ET: </strong>Added Amazon&#39;s statement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-amazon-disney-microsoft-climate-bill-lobbyist-opposition-161736552.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">82b8f8cb-11c5-47e6-abf9-23c9236ece08</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 16:17:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633105416</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T16:23:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4c746080-22d0-11ec-a4bf-01ce51c04ac8" width="5464" height="3640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4c746080-22d0-11ec-a4bf-01ce51c04ac8" width="5464" height="3640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[studio-fi via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of three wind turbines in the early morning fog at sunrise in the English countryside]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Three wind turbines at sunrise]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV and NBCUniversal agree to temporary extension to avoid channel blackout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-may-drop-nbc-channels-because-of-a-contract-dispute-080653391.html"><ins>public blows</ins></a> earlier in the week, YouTube TV and NBCUniversal have come to terms on a “short-term” agreement for the streaming service to continue carrying the broadcaster’s content.

type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve been holding out on a possible iPad purchase (or upgrade), this might be the time to strike. Apple’s newest base model iPad is now on sale, and we’ve got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">detailed review</a> on what is an incremental upgrade on what is, at heart, the same design we’ve had for many years now.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/447a4be1-22a0-11ec-b6ef-0aa12ce3a674" style="height:427;width:640;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="c2abcdc2-7fc7-3952-9279-bffb9b7af08e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>If you’re looking for an iPad with a design twist — or at least a smaller footprint — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">there’s the iPad mini</a>, pulling some of the redesigned iPad Pro DNA into a smaller package. That includes something close to an “all-screen” design, with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and power button with TouchID on the edge that supplants the need for a home button.</p><p>Meanwhile, the OG iPad design, so very lightly refreshed for 2021, doesn’t put a foot wrong — and it’s the cheapest new iPad you can get. For that $330, as Nate Ingraham’s review lays out, the hardware is powerful and the battery life is outstanding.</p><p>It has Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which first appeared inside the iPhone 11, circa 2019, but still an upgrade from the last vanilla iPad iteration. But yes, it’s not as powerful as the newer chips in the iPad Air and just-updated iPad mini.</p><p>If we sidestep the Pro models, tablet shopping will boil down to the iPad mini, Air or this new standard model. You could say this is some degree of choice — I just wish there was more tablet competition that didn’t run an Apple OS. Android tablets are still, typically, cheaper options that always leave me wanting.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-employees-working-condition-criticisms-090134228.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Amazon settles with employees allegedly fired for criticizing work conditions</a></h2><h3>The former employees were outspoken critics of many Amazon policies.</h3><h3></h3><p>Amazon was supposed to defend its decision in court to let Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa go last year. The former Amazon employees were outspoken critics of the company, and both were, according to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), illegally fired. The e-commerce giant didn&#39;t have to defend itself, however, because it has settled with the affected parties shortly before the hearing could take place.</p><p>The settlement still needs to be approved by the NLRB regional director in Seattle, but Cunningham and Costa are already considering the settlement a victory. In a joint statement, they said the development is a &quot;win for protecting workers’ rights.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-employees-working-condition-criticisms-090134228.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/subaru-shows-off-its-solterra-ev-in-a-new-video-100240185.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Watch Subaru reveal the Solterra, its first EV</a></h2><h3>Huh, that looks a little familiar.</h3><p></p><p>Subaru has shown the first video of its first EV, the 4x4 Solterra crossover, essentially confirming it&#39;s a slightly reworked version of Toyota&#39;s upcoming bZ4X EV.

Now, the Federal Communications Commission is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-prevent-sim-swapping-and-port-out-fraud">seeking</a> to create new rules that would help prevent SIM swapping scams and port-out fraud, both of which are techniques designed to hijack people&#39;s phone numbers and identities.&nbsp;</p><p>The commission said it has received numerous complaints from consumers &quot;who have suffered significant distress, inconvenience and financial harm&quot; as a result of both hijacking methods. SIM swapping is a technique wherein a bad actor convinces a wireless carrier to transfer a victim&#39;s service to a phone they control. When a bad actor successfully transfers the victim&#39;s service and number to another carrier, that&#39;s called port-out fraud.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make it harder for scammers to gain control of potential victims&#39; phone numbers, the FCC wants to amend the Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and Local Number Portability rules. In particular, it wants to require providers to adopt more secure methods in authenticating a person&#39;s identity before agreeing to transfer their service to a new phone or to another carrier. The commission also proposes a rule that would require providers to notify customers whenever a SIM switch or a port-out request is made on their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the FCC&#39;s rulemaking process, the public can now comment on these proposals. The commission still has to read those proposals and offer the public another chance to make their voice heard before it can decide whether to amend the aforementioned rules.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fcc-proposes-new-rules-sim-swapping-scams-093840753.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b22c7fc1-7239-413a-9bc0-2d629135ddd3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 09:38:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633081160</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T09:39:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financial Fraud Prevention]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec6b0f70-229a-11ec-9fc3-751afcc2590d" width="5053" height="3600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec6b0f70-229a-11ec-9fc3-751afcc2590d" width="5053" height="3600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PHILIPPE HUGUEN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture taken on Februrary 27 ,2015 in Lille, northern France, shows cellphone sim cards.

Now, the company has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-expects-renewable-energy-powered-us-sites-by-2025-ahead-plan-2021-09-30/">announced</a> that it will be well ahead schedule on the &quot;how&quot; part, using 100 percent renewable energy across its US operations by 2025 — five years ahead of schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve the goal, GM said it would increase energy efficiency and source renewables for its facilities. It also plans to create technology to store renewable energy over the medium and long term and &quot;create microgrids that help deploy renewable energy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>“We know climate action is a priority and every company must push itself to decarbonize further and faster,” said GM Chief Sustainability Officer Kristen Siemen. “That’s what we are doing by aiming to achieve 100 percent renewable energy five years earlier in the US.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>It also detailed plans to work with a company called PJM Interconnection to track energy usage based on carbon output of the grid at any given time. &quot;When the power being supplied consists mostly of fossil fuels, GM can make informed decisions about tapping into stored renewable energy or reduce the amount of power being consumed,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the vehicles it produces, GM plans to have 30 EVs globally by 2025, and still plans to &quot;eliminate tailpipe emissions for new light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars, SUVs and pickups) by 2035.&quot; The wording suggests that could include hydrogen-powered cars, though GM appears to be focusing mostly on EVs.&nbsp;</p><p>GM&#39;s plans to reduce pollution have drifted with the political winds, however. It was one of several automakers that backed the Trump administration&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-trump-administration-national-emissions-standards.html">plan</a> to bar California and other states from setting their own pollution and zero-emission requirements. That would have allowed manufacturers to raise fuel efficiency by just 1.5 percent per year, well below the previous administration&#39;s five percent requirement. GM withdrew from the litigation shortly after Joe Biden was elected President.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-us-factories-will-switch-to-renewable-energy-five-years-ahead-of-schedule-085010165.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">217141ac-471b-4798-af2a-0697e5ed49a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 08:50:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633078215</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T08:50:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08c8d550-228f-11ec-bcfd-a54d0ce9bcf8" width="3500" height="2317" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08c8d550-228f-11ec-bcfd-a54d0ce9bcf8" width="3500" height="2317" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rebecca Cook / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Chevrolet Bolt EV vehicle is seen on the assembly line at General Motors Orion Assembly in Lake Orion, Michigan, U.S., March 19, 2018.

Waymo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-rides-deliveries-san-francisco-california-110525885.html">applied</a> for a deployment permit from the DMV back in January, while Cruise submitted its application in March.

Its vehicles can operate in parts of San Francisco and San Mateo counties with a speed limit of 65 mph. Like Cruise&#39;s vehicles, they&#39;re not allowed on the roads in weather conditions worse than light rain and light fog. When it applied for a permit with the DMV, it said it will deploy hybrid Chrysler Pacifica minivans and all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUVs, which will operation around the clock.</p><p>As the DMV&#39;s announcement notes, it has now approved three deployment permits in the state. The first company it approved was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html">Nuro</a>, which uses autonomous vehicles to make deliveries.

The parties have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/scarlett-johansson-disney-black-widow.html">reached</a> a settlement for the lawsuit Johansson filed over the hybrid release strategy used for<em> Black Widow</em>. If you&#39;ll recall, the actor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">sued Disney</a> over the company&#39;s decision to release her movie in theaters and on Disney+ at the same time, accusing the entertainment giant of breach of contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Johansson&#39;s camp argued that <em>Black Widow</em> was supposed to be released in theaters exclusively under her deal with Marvel. According to the lawsuit she filed, she could lose as much as $50 million due to the hybrid release, seeing as her compensation is tied directly with the movie&#39;s box office success and doesn&#39;t include a cut from what Disney would make from streaming. People have had to pay $30 for a Premier Access pass to watch the movie on Disney+, and the company said <em>Black Widow</em> earned $60 million from streaming during its opening weekend.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Her lawsuit also said that her camp tried to contact Disney and Marvel to re-negotiate their deal, but they were allegedly unresponsive. Neither party disclosed the terms of their agreement, but both issued a statement mentioning future collaborations. Alan Bergman, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said he looks &quot;forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney&#39;s <em>Tower of Terror</em>.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, entertainment workers are gearing up for a strike because studios like Disney are rapidly producing content after pandemic-related restrictions had lifted. The situation led to poor working conditions with long hours and no breaks for production crew. Entertainment unions are hoping to convince studios to make changes, including ending the lower pay scale for smaller streaming services. Under the current rules, streaming services with fewer than 20 million subscribers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-showbiz-union-tv-service-20-million-subscribers-124041017.html">Apple TV+</a> does can pay their workers lower wages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f6d2323-df8f-43df-89b6-84fb696b8c63</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 02:48:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633056555</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T02:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/7ec51aa0-fdc6-11ea-bef6-c4c819b17fd3" width="5340" height="3772" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/7ec51aa0-fdc6-11ea-bef6-c4c819b17fd3" width="5340" height="3772" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alberto E.
