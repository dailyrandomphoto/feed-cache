According to <em>The New York Times</em>, Facebook is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/technology/facebook-workplace-transparency-leaks.html"><ins>limiting access</ins></a> to some internal groups that deal with “sensitive” issues like safety and elections. That the change, which was made to prevent further leaks, immediately leaked is both highly amusing and emblematic of some of the bigger issues the company is currently facing.</p><p>Ever since Haugen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html"><ins>revealed</ins></a> herself as the whistleblower, one of the more noteworthy aspects of her story is that the documents she provided to Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission were widely accessible to employees. The documents included slides detailing the company’s research into teen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html"><ins>mental health</ins></a>, as well as numerous memos about how the company has handled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-oversight-board-cross-check-180358569.html"><ins>rules</ins></a> for VIPs, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html"><ins>misinformation</ins></a> and other thorny issues.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>The Times</em> points out, the reason these documents were so readily available is because Facebook has long had an open culture that promotes sharing. And employees themselves often take to its internal communication platform, Workplace, to discuss controversial issues facing the company.</p><p>But now the social network is moving away from that openness. The company is making some internal groups private, and will remove employees “whose work isn’t related to safety and security,” according to the report. “Sensitive Integrity discussions will happen in closed, curated forums in the future,” the company told employees in a memo.</p><p>On one hand, the fact that news of the change immediately leaked would seem to back up that the company is in fact more leaky than it has been in years past. But it could also signal increasing unrest among employees, some of whom are reportedly concerned that walling off teams that work on important issues could ultimately do more harm than good.</p><p>It also underscores just how much Facebook is still reeling from Haugen’s disclosures. In addition to the Senate hearing last week, Haugen is expected <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/tech/facebook-whistleblower-january-6-select-committee/index.html"><ins>to brief</ins></a> the select committee investigating the Jan. 6th insurrection, as well as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-whistleblower-to-be-invited-to-eu-parliament/"><ins>European lawmakers</ins></a> investigating the company. The SEC also appears to be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-claims-test-secs-reach-11634040180"><ins>investigating</ins></a> her claims.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-latest-effort-to-curtail-leaks-immediately-leaked-233923463.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">443bb5f7-df08-40ca-85b5-f8d0302901af</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 23:39:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634168364</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T23:39:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e1ff93c0-2c7d-11ec-b771-a6ff5267622f" width="6000" height="3994" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e1ff93c0-2c7d-11ec-b771-a6ff5267622f" width="6000" height="3994" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook EMEA headquarters on Grand Canal Square in Dublin Docklands.

While that&#39;s something that will make fixing the OLED Switch on your own more difficult, iFixit suspects it could help with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity issues.</p><p>Speaking of repairability, iFixit gave the OLED model a score of seven out of 10. That’s one less than the company awarded the original model. The OLED Switch features a non-modular storage module that’s soldered to its motherboard, making easy repairs and upgrades on that front something you can’t do.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-teardown-210513147.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">22f59da5-db57-4c7b-82e9-772fb6611199</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 21:05:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634158633</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T20:57:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/281ba730-2c66-11ec-b7ff-712c08a13ad4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/281ba730-2c66-11ec-b7ff-712c08a13ad4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter's Spaces Spark Program will pay creators to broadcast live audio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has launched a new three-month accelerator program to help up-and-coming Spaces creators.

Now, streamers and their trusted helper will be able to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-continued-fight-against-hate-and-harassment">temporarily mute people for minutes</a>, hours or the length of an entire livestream. According to Eric Han, head of Tiktok&#39;s US Safety team, muting a person will remove their entire comment history from the stream. And of course, you could also just turn off comments entirely or filter out specific keywords.

Han says 73.3 percent of harassment videos were removed before there were any user reports, whereas that figure was 66.2 percent in the previous quarter. Similarly, 72.9 percent of videos showing hateful behavior were removed in the second quarter, compared to 67.3 percent previously.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf7fb092-eeb9-4f03-bb59-4c505749554d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634150384</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T18:39:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - January 21, 2020: TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A live-action 'System Shock' TV series is on the way]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nightdive Studios’ immersive sim franchise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/system%20shock"><ins>System Shock</ins></a> franchise is being turned into a live-action TV show.

The goal was to find “reference” or “benchmark” wares and copy them. A document from 2016 detailed a plan for an Amazon brand called Solimo, which is tailored toward the Indian market.

The first strike of Amazon workers organized by the CGIL, Cisl and Uil unions at the Arzano headquarters was totally deserted by the workers who did not join the presidium to which, in addition to the unions, some formations of the extra-parliamentary left joined. The unions had called the strike day to ask for a review of many aspects of staff contracts: workloads, shifts, meal vouchers, bonuses, travel allowances and reduced working hours, and a general stabilization of drivers, the logistics sector and the administered employees. For some trade unionists, the absence of workers from the garrison should be read as "fear that their contracts will not be renewed".

In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/advancing-online-bullying-harassment-policies/">post</a> attributed to Head of Safety Antigone Davis, the company said it will take down mass coordinated harassment campaigns targeted at individuals at heightened risk of offline harm. It will do so even if the content people post wouldn’t normally violate its safety guidelines. Additionally, Facebook says it will remove objectionable content in whatever form it takes, be that direct messages, comments or posts. As part of the same policy, the company will remove state-linked networks that work together to silence and harass people.</p><p>Had the above policy been in place in the past, one situation where Facebook may have enforced it was when Taylor Swift’s Instagram account was bombarded with snake emoji following a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7934297/taylor-swift-the-snake-history-kim-kanye-instagram">dramatic breakup with electronic producer Calvin Harris</a>. Speaking of celebrities, the company has also put in place new protections to safeguard public figures from sexual harassment and appearance shaming. To that end, it plans to remove profiles, pages and groups dedicated to sexualizing those individuals. It will also target “severe sexualizing content,” including photoshopped images and drawings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We made these changes because attacks like these can weaponize a public figure’s appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent,” the company said.  Facebook will also provide additional protections for individuals who become famous involuntarily. Those may include individuals like journalists and human rights activists.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly faced pressure to do more to prevent bullying and harassment across all of its apps, but particularly on Instagram. In the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which saw <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/football/england-racist-abuse-bukayo-saka-jadon-sancho-marcus-rashford-euro-2020-final-spt-intl/index.html">three Black players</a> on the English national team face a flood of harassment after England lost to Italy, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri promised the company would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-limits-feature-test-223844994.html">introduce new feature</a>s to protect users. “Racism and hate speech have no place on Instagram,” he said at the time. “It is not only honestly fucked up to see people treated that way, but it breaks how Instagram works.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-targeted-harassment-policy-172858497.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10775835-5fcc-4413-9e16-a618775a6c8b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:28:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634146144</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T17:29:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2c111270-26c2-11ec-afe7-9bdea293e11a" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2c111270-26c2-11ec-afe7-9bdea293e11a" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 06: In this photo illustration, the Facebook logo is displayed on the screen of an iPhone on October 06, 2021 in Paris, France.

The first stage is a series of server-side enhancements that will better identify and remove cheaters from games, and this is scheduled to hit <em>Warzone</em> with the Pacific update later this year. These new server tools will be live in <em>Vanguard </em>when it comes out on November 5th.</p><p>The second prong is a PC kernel-level driver designed to monitor the deepest level of every player&#39;s rig while they&#39;re in-game, in an effort to stop outside software from sneaking in through this back door. The kernel, or ring 0, is the most privileged level of any PC, granting access to every layer of hardware, and generally reserved for things like graphics card drivers and trusted bits of the operating system. The RICOCHET Anti-Cheat kernel-level driver will only turn on when <em>Warzone</em> or <em>Vanguard</em> is active; it&#39;s not an always-on situation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While operating in the kernel isn&#39;t uncommon for anti-cheat software, this is likely the most concerning part of Activision&#39;s new plans for many players. Riot Games faced scrutiny in 2020 for implementing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-vanguard-riot-games-security-interview-video-170025435.html">similar kernel-level driver in <em>Valorant</em></a>, though the main issue was that it was always on, operating even when the game wasn&#39;t active. (Confusingly, the <em>Valorant</em> anti-cheat system is called Vanguard).</p><div id="c7840546fbe84c279e58bf5f1b31e757"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4W_1zA6j9FU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>This isn&#39;t a new worry, either — in 2013, the always-on ring 0 anti-cheat system employed by <a href="https://play.esea.net/news/12692">ESEA</a> was commandeered to turn unsuspecting players&#39; PCs into a secret bitcoin mining farm.</p><p>With these lessons in mind, Activision has stressed that RICOCHET will only be active when the associated game is live, saying specifically, &quot;the driver shuts down when you exit the game and turns on when you start a new game.&quot;</p><p>The kernel-level driver will hit <em>Warzone</em> alongside the Pacific update this year, and it&#39;ll come to <em>Vanguard</em> at a later date.</p><p>Cheating has been a significant problem in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-warzone-bans-60000-confirmed-cheaters-071107304.html">for a long while now</a>. Activision has banned more than 500,000 accounts since the game&#39;s launch, though it&#39;s not uncommon for matches to be riddled with aimbots and cheap hacks to this day. Players have been screaming for a robust anti-cheat system in <em>Warzone</em> and other Call of Duty titles, and RICOCHET is Activision&#39;s kernel-level, not-always-on answer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-duty-warzone-vanguard-anti-cheat-ricochet-kernel-driver-170043541.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86578928-da61-49ae-82ca-1e10204557d4</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634144204</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T16:56:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07fa1c00-2c45-11ec-a8d7-6b86cb0c143c" width="1920" height="1193" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07fa1c00-2c45-11ec-a8d7-6b86cb0c143c" width="1920" height="1193" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty Warzone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Warzone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DoorDash establishes $1M relief fund for restaurants hit by natural disasters]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the next year, DoorDash has earmarked <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Establishes-1000000-Restaurant-Disaster-Relief-Fund/default.aspx"><ins>$1,000,000</ins></a> to support local restaurants affected by state or federally declared natural disasters.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SoundLink Flex" href="https://fave.co/3iZbqmR">SoundLink Flex</a> has an IP67 rating, meaning it&#39;s water, dust and dirt resistant, and the company even claims that the speaker will float to the surface if you drop it in water (but you should probably fish it out quickly if it drops into a bathtub or the ocean).</p><p>The silicone rear and powder-coated steel grille should protect the speaker from drops and bumps, according to Bose.

Bose says it packed the SoundLink Flex with features &quot;to deliver astonishing audio performance.&quot; It claims that the custom transducer provides maximum audio clarity and &quot;bass that you can feel in your chest.” The SoundLink Flex also has dual-opposing passive radiators, as well as Bose&#39;s digital signal processing tech, which should minimize distortion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/67d190d0-2c3c-11ec-bde7-c031a012c437" alt="A Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker in some mud." data-uuid="cb2ba729-b153-3e91-a5de-b30f13eca84d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>The speaker can detect its orientation and adjust the audio output accordingly. So, whether it&#39;s horizontal, vertical or hanging from the utility loop, the sound will be optimized. It&#39;s the company&#39;s first Bluetooth speaker that uses this Bose PositionIQ tech.</p><p>SoundLink Flex can remember up to eight Bluetooth connections to make it easy to switch from one device to another. You can adjust the settings using the Bose Connect app and control your phone&#39;s voice assistant and take calls using the speaker&#39;s microphone.</p><p>You can pair a second Bose Bluetooth speaker for stereo or simultaneous playback. The SoundLink Flex can connect to other Bose speakers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-smart-soundbar-900-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-144433233.html">soundbars</a> as part of a home audio system. Bose says you&#39;ll get up to 12 hours of playback on a single charge and you can recharge the lithium-ion battery with a USB-C cable.</p><p>The SoundLink Flex is just under eight inches wide, 2.1 inches deep and 3.6 inches tall. It weighs just over a pound and is available in black, white smoke or stone blue. The speaker costs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$149" href="https://fave.co/3iZbqmR">$149</a> and you can pick it up from Bose&#39;s website starting today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundlink-flex-portable-bluetooth-speaker-rugged-160442384.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f795460-119b-4595-bb0e-1865f716ea24</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:04:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634149581</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T18:26:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/650b6bf0-2c3c-11ec-b6d1-5212858bfa79" width="1919" height="1391" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/650b6bf0-2c3c-11ec-b6d1-5212858bfa79" width="1919" height="1391" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bose]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding a Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker that has water on it.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anker's audio glasses pair swappable frames with 'surround' sound for $200]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker is jumping into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jlab-audio-jbuds-frames-true-wireless-open-ear-speakers-eyewear-152928580.html">increasingly crowded</a> world of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-04-bose-frames-audio-ar-sunglasses-available-january.html">audio eyewear</a>.

The website has been testing the feature for a year, and now that it&#39;s widely available, community mods and mod-approved users will be able to create Predictions Tournaments with a series of questions that challenges you to predict the outcome of an event or conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll get 1,000 tokens for free when you join a tournament, which can consist of as many questions as a moderator wants — they can add more even after the tournament has started. When you vote for the prediction you want, you&#39;ll have to bet some of the tokens you get after you joined. How to distribute those tokens is totally up to you, and you will win more on top of the ones you used for every correct prediction. The larger the number of tokens you put in, the more you can win. However, you&#39;ll have to make your tokens last throughout the tournament, and there&#39;s no way to get more if it turns out that your prediction game is weak. It&#39;s a totally user-driven experience, since the tournament&#39;s creator will also be in charge of resolving the outcome and making sure you get your winnings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, what do you get for correct predictions aside from winning tokens? Mostly, recognition in the form of a leaderboard. Tokens are only for use in the Prediction experience, so you can&#39;t really do anything with them on the website. Reddit will start rolling out the feature today, and it will be available for all communities with at least 10,000 members.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f01d7b0-2c1c-11ec-bef2-80c96a2637bc" style="height:647;width:669;" alt="Reddit" data-uuid="e5336946-1b23-3e31-b9a7-7f8237c988a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reddit</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-predictions-150040687.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b16da11-17c8-4cf1-a92b-d4020805bf7c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634126677</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T12:04:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95f87310-06a9-11ec-bf66-80c6a3820096" width="3301" height="2156" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95f87310-06a9-11ec-bf66-80c6a3820096" width="3301" height="2156" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reddit app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

The 90-year-old Star Trek icon was one of four crew members aboard Blue Origin&#39;s NS-18 mission as it flew to an altitude of 66 miles. He edged out 82-year-old aviation pioneer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html">Wally Funk</a>, who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">set the previous age record</a> just a few months earlier.</p><p>The New Shepard flight also included Blue Origin VP Audrey Powers, Planet Labs co-founder Dr. Chris Boshuizen and Medidata co-creator Glen de Vries. This is the second of three crewed missions Blue Origin has planned for 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is an important moment for spaceflight, not to mention sci-fi fans. It shows that age isn&#39;t much of a restriction for brief trips to space, and fulfills the dreams of anyone who wanted to see Captain Kirk visit the final frontier in real life — even if he wasn&#39;t helming a starship.</p><p>With that said, it&#39;s also a timely public relations boost for Blue Origin. Jeff Bezos&#39; private spaceflight outfit is currently grappling with accusations of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-toxic-workplace-employee-letter-181051514.html">toxic work environment</a>, not to mention the fallout of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">legal tussle with SpaceX</a> over NASA&#39;s Moon mission contract. Shatner&#39;s successful trip won&#39;t completely distract from those issues, but it might give Blue Origin a chance to highlight some achievements at a time when many are focused on its shortcomings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/william-shatner-blue-origin-spaceflight-successful-145444763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b220452-01e4-4f4a-a3f8-7f37eeadfaa4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:54:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634137672</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T15:08:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d424de30-2c29-11ec-b72d-6f2c98df9ce1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d424de30-2c29-11ec-b72d-6f2c98df9ce1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[William Shatner and the Blue Origin NS-18 crew]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[William Shatner and the Blue Origin NS-18 crew]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat is back online after outage (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/snapchat">Snapchat</a> is back online after some users had problems with the app this morning, with several noting on Twitter that they were <a href="https://twitter.com/lilliana_romero/status/1448255535489355780">unable</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/MariahRain11/status/1448289817469595655">send snaps</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448254521914937349">In a tweet posted at</a> 7:29AM ET, Snap said it it was looking into the problem and, at 10:31AM ET, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/snapchatsupport/status/1448295237978365954">said</a> the issue was fixed.

Designed for the company&#39;s full-frame <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">Alpha-series</a> mirrorless cameras, it&#39;s the lightest 70-200mm F2.8 lens on the market at 1,045 grams, Sony said. It also offers a number of features aimed at movie creators not usually seen in a lens like this.&nbsp;</p><p>While large zoom lenses tend to focus slowly, Sony said the new model uses four XD linear motors to deliver reliable focus that&#39;s up to three times faster than rival models, and four times faster than the previous model on Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">Alpha 1 camera</a>. Tracking with continuous autofocus while zooming has improved by 30 percent compared first-gen model, too. It also focuses quietly, so the motor sound is less likely to be picked up by a camera&#39;s microphone.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d9198c7feeb44655a87fc5859b5bda13"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsZnBaumeF0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Video shooters often need to pull focus between subjects, but lenses designed for photography usually exhibit &quot;breathing,&quot; or zooming in and out while changing focus. Sony said it designed the FE 70-200 F2.8 GM OSS II to curtail that, while also reducing focus shift while zooming. Such features are usually only found in cinema lenses that cost considerably more.</p><p>The lens should deliver nice bokeh thanks to the wide, continuous F2.8 aperture, while offering good handling with dual lens elements that move internally. It also offers three separate rings for focus, aperture and zoom, making it easier to rig for cinema use. Other features include high resolution, extra-low dispersion, aspherical glass to suppress chromatic aberrations, Sony&#39;s Nano AR Coating II to reduce flares and ghosting and a new 11-blade aperture that produces softer, more circular bokeh.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony also offers <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1222777-REG/sony_sel14tc_fe_1_4x_teleconverter.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">FE 1.4x</a> and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1222778-REG/sony_sel20tc_fe_2x_teleconverter.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">FE 2.0x</a> teleconverters ($548 for each) that extend the lens&#39;s focal length up to 400mm at F5.6. The FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II zoom lens will go on sale in December for $2,800, or $3,500 CAD in Canada.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonys-lightweight-70-200-mm-zoom-has-features-designed-for-video-creators-140542959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0af587ce-efd6-40be-b5b8-6e59aa843daf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:05:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634136489</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T14:48:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b73ec7c0-2c30-11ec-bfff-7f9439160618" width="2000" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b73ec7c0-2c30-11ec-bfff-7f9439160618" width="2000" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony's lightweight 70-200mm zoom has features designed for video creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony's lightweight 70-200mm zoom has features designed for video creators]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's new Chromebook Spin 514 features a fanless design and improved webcam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its usual autumn laptop refresh, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer" href="https://fave.co/2YInpi1">Acer</a> is announcing a host of new Chromebook today that&#39;ll roll out in the coming months. There are four models being refreshed today: the Chromebook Spin 514, Chromebook 515, Chromebook 514, and Chromebook Spin 314. That&#39;s a lot of product names, but Spin devices can flip around with a 360-degree hinge, and the last two digits denote the screen size. That should hopefully ground you as we go through these new models.</p><p>Most interesting is probably the Spin 514 (pictured above), which combines a 14-inch 1080p touchscreen that has minimal bezels with Intel&#39;s 11th-generation Core i3, i5 or i7 processors. This laptop has no fans, which means these probably aren&#39;t the highest-powered versions of Intel&#39;s chips, but they should still provide solid performance for Chrome OS. Acer also put some focus on the webcam, a wise choice given how we&#39;re all still stuck on videos calls for the foreseeable future. It&#39;s a 1080p camera with a blue glass filter and new noise-reduction technology to remove things like light flares. We&#39;ll have to see how this works in practice, but given how many laptops have entirely mediocre webcams, any improvements here will be welcome.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="2ed702dc-e239-43be-a58c-8a43c95d2c4a"/><p>Other specs include up to 16GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, Intel Iris Xe graphics and 10 hours of battery life. The Spin 514 weighs in at 3 pounds, so it&#39;s not going to be the lightest thing to use in tablet mode, but otherwise it sounds like it&#39;ll be a very good Chromebook — it also simply looks nice and well-built, at least as far as I can tell from these images. And Acer has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">solid track record</a> of making very good Chromebooks, so hopefully that&#39;ll continue here. The Spin 514 is expected to arrive in the US in January and starts at $700.</p><p>Acer&#39;s Chromebook 515 (which comes in consumer and enterprise editions) has similar specs to the Spin 514, though it has a larger 15.6-inch display. Given the large size, this laptop isn&#39;t a convertible, which is probably a smart move. For a 15-inch laptop, though, it&#39;s pretty light — only 3.75 pounds. It comes with the same 11th-generation processor options as the Spin 514, though it also has a budget Pentium Gold option (paired with Intel&#39;s UHD graphics rather than the Iris Xe). The Chromebook 515 will initially be available in Europe this month for €499; the Enterprise version will come to the US in January 2022 starting at $640.</p><p>Acer has a few less expensive Chromebooks coming out, as well. The Chromebook Spin 314 starts at $500 and arrives in the US in November. For that price, you&#39;ll get a 14-inch screen with an unfortunate 1,366 x 768 resolution, which is pretty unacceptable in the year 2021. It also features budget processors in the form of Intel&#39;s Pentium Gold or two Celeron options and has a 360-degree hinge, as the name implies. More intriguing is the Chromebook 514, which pairs a 14-inch, 1080p display with MediaTek&#39;s 8-core Kompanio 828 processor and 8GB of RAM. We haven&#39;t tested a MediaTek Chromebook in a while, so we can&#39;t say for sure how it&#39;ll perform yet. But Acer is promising 15 hours of battery life, and the laptop weighs less than 3 pounds, so it does have some potential as a budget Chromebook (the 514 will cost $400 when it is released in December).&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-514-fall-2021-updates-134548903.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d54e340a-68fb-48c3-b5fd-075c26a8617c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:45:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634168736</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T23:45:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb40bab0-2c26-11ec-aff8-1394753ed502" width="3000" height="2377" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb40bab0-2c26-11ec-aff8-1394753ed502" width="3000" height="2377" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 514 (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 514 (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's glasses-free 3D SpatialLabs laptop arrives this winter]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-conceptd-7-7-pro-laptop-update-300-mid-tower-134558886.html">usual</a> raft of hardware updates, Acer is adding new ConceptD machines with new displays and different chassis options. But the most notable product on the docket for late-2021 is the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition" href="https://fave.co/2YInpi1">ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition</a>, which packs a stereoscopic display. It’s the first time that such a product is available for everyone to buy after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-spatiallabs-stereoscopic-view-134520222.html">the company first teased the project earlier this year</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-spatiallabs-stereoscopic-view-134520222.html">Back then</a>, Acer and SpatialLabs teamed up to put one of the latter’s stereoscopic displays on the former’s machines. The idea is to enable 3D artists to preview their work in a form closer to the finished article long before it had reached the lengthy rendering pipeline. But while that initial concept was only available to developers who applied (and promised to share their work with Acer), this is a retail product.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition is packing an 11th-generation Core i7, with the option of a GeForce RTX 3080, up to 64GB RAM and up to a 2TB SSD. And users are going to be staring into a Pantone-validated 4K display with a Delta E&lt;2 color accuracy for those who need it. Of course, this is only a sideshow to the eye-tracking cameras sited on the top bezel to match the 3D images to your gaze.</p><p>Acer added that, on the software side, it has updated the AI underpinning the system that enables users to view 3D content from any 2D image (or video) shown on screen. The company has also launched a new developer site to allow users to download all of the various plugins and tools (including a hand-tracking app and add-ons for Unreal Engine) to make everything work.</p><p>Of course, it’s not simply designers who may find the D 7 (don’t make me type it all out again) a useful proposition. The company says that it already has examples of companies using this as a car configurator for showroom use, architects using this to show off home designs and researchers examining high-resolution images from satellites.</p><p>If you want one of these, bear in mind that you’ll need to wait until December (if you’re in EMEA) or 2022 (if you’re in the US). Plus, you know, it’s going to cost: The starting price on that side of the pond will be €3,599 (roughly $4,158).</p><p>At the same time, the company is launching a new 16-inch ConceptD 3 model with a 16:10-ratio display and a 15.6-inch convertible edition. These, too, will be reaching the US at some point early next year, with base prices running from $1,700 through to $2,000, depending on your size preferences.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-fall-2021-conceptd-7-spatiallabs-edition-134507031.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">082eb81b-ab5c-436f-bf0d-7548dabaae6d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:45:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634134171</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T14:09:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbead7e0-2b51-11ec-ab7f-be692b31021c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbead7e0-2b51-11ec-ab7f-be692b31021c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs edition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly exploring ways to use AirPods as health devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s health ambitions for AirPods might extend beyond using them to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-conversation-boost-feature-175701382.html">boost conversations</a>. <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800?mod=djemalertNEWS">sources</a> claim Apple is exploring multiple ways it can use AirPods as health devices. It might use the buds as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html">hearing aids</a>, but it could also use the motion sensors to correct your posture. A prototype would even include a thermometer to check your core body temperature, according to leaked documents.</p><p>The features wouldn&#39;t show up in 2022 and might not be available at all, the sources said. Apple declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple would face numerous hurdles to marketing AirPods as health gadgets. The company would likely require regulatory clearance for at least some features. A US Food and Drug Administration ruleset due in 2022 might make that possible, but it could still take months to approve the earbuds. Even Bose had to wait a long time before it could sell its FDA-cleared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">SoundControl hearing aids</a>.</p><p>There are technical challenges, too. Right now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> won&#39;t last longer than 4.5 hours for listening (with noise cancelling on), and 3.5 hours for calls — that just wouldn&#39;t be practical for health wearables that might need to sit in your ears all day. They&#39;d also need to be comfortable for long periods and adapt to varying types of hearing loss.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to see why Apple might expand the AirPods&#39; usefulness, though. As with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">the Apple Watch</a>, health could be a selling point that grow the audience beyond the enthusiast core. It might also court a relatively underserved market of people who may have mild or moderate hearing loss, but either can&#39;t afford most hearing aids or don&#39;t like the limited functionality and drab designs that often define the category.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-health-device-leak-132037664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">066803f7-d9d7-4501-b5dd-e0b0ebdef386</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:20:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634131150</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T13:19:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
