The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-date-161123048.html">sent out invites earlier this week</a> that featured the words “California Streaming,” which of course led many of us in the industry to speculate like crazy what surprises might be in store. My money is on new TV+ or Apple Music content, while <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apples-californian-streaming-invite-means-3808212/">others are guessing</a> game streaming or a cloud-based macOS might be possible. But as always, we already have a good idea of what to expect thanks to analysts, leakers and FCC filings. Here’s a selection of the more-credible leaks that have been swirling around so you can catch up on all the iPhone 13 rumors ahead of the September 14th keynote.</p><h2>iPhone 13</h2><p>Just as there were four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12 models</a> last year, we’re expecting the same number of iPhone 13s next week. This was pretty much confirmed by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-references-new-iphone-models-magsafe-fcc-filing-100602419.html">an FCC filing about upcoming MagSafe updates</a>, which didn’t name them but referred to four “New Phone” items in addition to the existing generation. Those four devices are most likely the iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, and I’m personally glad Apple is keeping the baby iPhone around.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg">early as February this year</a>, rumors of the new iPhones featuring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-2021-always-on-display-223000663.html">Always On displays</a> have been floating and have only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12s-always-on-display-leak-164539339.html">gained</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-2021-gurman-portrait-mode-pro-res-always-on-display-bloomberg-122438020.html">traction</a> since. This would allow Apple to constantly have the time and other system indicators appear on your lock screen. Another popular rumor suggests the next iPhones will have smaller notches, and that a 120Hz screen is coming to the Pro model. If that’s true, Apple would be catching up to Samsung, though Google still hasn’t hit that high of a refresh rate on its flagships yet.</p><p>With the potential Always On display and faster refresh rates, battery life could be a concern for the new flagships. But it sounds like Apple might be mitigating that by using lower power LTPO (or Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) screens and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-ming-chi-quo-174922962.html">bigger batteries</a>. There’s also talk of an in-display fingerprint reader coming to the iPhone 13 line, though the reports on that are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-ming-chi-quo-174922962.html">less consistent</a>. It’d also be weird since the main iPhone series, haven’t had a Touch ID sensor since the iPhone X was launched in 2017.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5c008eb0-11a1-11ec-b65f-4889bf86ab53" alt="A person holding a blue iPhone 12 and blue iPhone 12 pro in each hand, with the devices&#39; rear cameras facing up. " data-uuid="606c6858-08af-3736-8b35-b86f69c0e207"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond their screens, the iPhones are also expected to get some camera upgrades. On the hardware front, we’re reportedly getting improved ultra-wide cameras across the lineup, with better sensors and lenses. As for imaging software, Apple is supposedly adding an automatic astrophotography feature and a portrait video mode that could blur out the background while you film. Samsung already offers this on its S21 series, so it’ll be interesting to see how the two compare.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html">surprising recent rumor</a> suggests the iPhone 13 might even support satellite communications, which could let you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-satellite-limited-coverage-152109533.html">make emergency calls</a> if you’re out of a typical cellular coverage area. This would be a unique feature in modern smartphones, and almost hard to believe. But the report said Apple would be using a modified Qualcomm radio to enable this, meaning the components could already be easily available, making it more possible this is coming this year.</p><p>Externally, the phones aren’t expected to look significantly different from their predecessors, other than a potentially “gripper” texture on their backs. Reports seem to agree that the lightning port will remain, and that the updated MagSafe charger (and the phones) will have stronger magnets to prevent accidental slippage.</p><p>Finally, as we’ve been referring to it throughout this article, the next generation is most likely going to be called the iPhone 13. Not the iPhone 12S or the iPhone 14, because apparently Apple is not superstitious. Which is cool.

Specifically, we’re expecting the company to unveil the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-larger-screen-sizes-213316597.html">Watch Series 7 with larger cases and screens</a>.</p><p>Some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">reports suggest</a> the new wearables will also sport thinner bezels, a flatter design, a faster chip and updated “ultra-wideband functionality,” which might improve its communication with doors, locks and other devices. And that’s about all we’ve heard so far.</p><p>According to various sources, anticipated features like a body-temperature sensor or blood sugar monitor won’t be ready for this year’s Watch. Those waiting for a rugged variant will also probably have to wait till 2022 at least.</p><h2>AirPods 3</h2><p>Speaking of waiting, we’re coming up on about two and a half years since Apple launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">AirPods 2nd gen in 2019</a>. It took about the same amount of time for the company to introduce the follow-up to its original wireless earbuds, though, so it’s very likely we’ll see the next generation come September 14th.</p><p>At some point, rumors suggested they might arrive earlier this year. We’re now well into the 2nd half of 2021, and all we’ve seen of the third-generation AirPods is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html">photo leaked in February</a>. The image is purportedly of the regular model, not the Pro, and includes the device’s carrying case. The holder appears wider than the second gen’s and the buds seem to have an in-ear design similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">the AirPods Pro</a>. That fits with other rumors swirling around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1594cc10-11a2-11ec-bfbb-a120cbd8efe3" alt="Two white wireless earbuds on top of a white charging case.

That contradicts an earlier Bloomberg report that said those features wouldn’t make it. The Bloomberg story did say the AirPods would offer a new chip and longer battery life, though.</p><h2>iPad 9, iPad mini 6, MacBook Pro and more</h2><p>Those three product lines seem all but guaranteed to show up at next week’s launch, but let’s not forget about the iPad. Apple’s next entry-level tablet <em>should </em>be the iPad 9 and multiple reports from sources like <em>Digitimes </em>and <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman suggest that it’ll arrive this month alongside the iPhones. An iPad mini 6 is also supposedly on the horizon.</p><p>In general, rumors indicate that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ipad-9">the iPad 9</a> is going to look quite similar to its predecessor, with a somewhat thinner design and slightly bigger screen. The more noteworthy upgrades are likely to be internal, with faster chips and more RAM being a popular speculation. If Apple does launch a new tablet next week, these incremental improvements do seem like a given. It’s also possible that the iPad 9 may offer MagSafe support, though since a slate wasn’t mentioned in the FCC filing I mentioned earlier, this seems unlikely.</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad-mini-6-2021">the iPad mini 6</a>, it appears as if a redesign might be in the works that would make the compact tablet look more like the M1 iPad Pro, with thinner bezels and a squarer design. It could also come with a USB-C port instead of Lightning, as well as a potential Smart Connector for keyboards and other accessories.</p><p>That’s a whole smorgasbord of Apple devices that might be unveiled next week, as the company readies new products for the upcoming holiday shopping season. But there could still be more surprises up its sleeve. Though a new Apple TV was already launched earlier this year, based on the words California Streaming on the invitation, we’ll probably hear about new shows coming to TV+. Plus, <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Gurman also wrote in a newsletter that he’s expecting a redesigned MacBook Pro between September and November this year, which means it could be announced alongside the iPhones. Or maybe Apple is saving that for another event later in the year.</p><p>Whatever you might be most interested to see come September 14th, it’s clear Apple has plenty to show off. We’ll be hosting a live show on the Engadget YouTube channel when the event is over, so that we can all be disappointed or excited together with you in real time. I hope you’ll come hang with me and UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith and have some fun then!</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-apple-iphone-13-rumors-leaks-california-streaming-event-160034910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">676df74a-c1d6-4742-926e-fe94f1e76bc5</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 16:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631288752</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T15:45:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3a6d83e7-1fa6-11eb-afd7-07d1f2bc4163" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3a6d83e7-1fa6-11eb-afd7-07d1f2bc4163" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Judge issues permanent injunction on App Store model in Epic v. Apple case]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The judge in the case between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games">Epic Games</a> has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524421061/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0814-0">issued a permanent injunction</a> against Apple. The company must allow App Store developers to direct users to other payment systems, which would let them bypass the 30 percent cut of in-app payments that Apple takes. Engadget has contacted Epic Games for comment.</p><p>Judge Gonzales Rogers ruled in Epic&#39;s favor on one count, per <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524421061/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0814-0">court documents</a> posted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-revealed-apple-must-allow-app-store-devs-to-redirect-users-to-other-payment-systems/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>. She determined that Apple violated California&#39;s Unfair Competition law, leading to the injunction, which is set to take effect in 90 days.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the injunction, Apple is &quot;permanently restrained and enjoined&quot; from preventing developers to include in their apps and metadata &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&quot; Apple also may not stop developers from &quot;communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&quot;</p><p>On every other count, Judge Gonzales Rogers ruled in Apple&#39;s favor, determining, among other things, that the App Store doesn&#39;t violate antitrust law. She also ruled against Epic in Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524422113/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0812-0-2">counterclaim</a> for breach of contract. As such, Epic must pay Apple $3.65 million. That&#39;s equivalent to 30 percent of the $12.2 million Epic earned from <em>Fortnite </em>iOS players between August and October 2020 through the Epic Direct Payment system. Epic also has to pay Apple 30 percent of the revenue it received via that system between November 1st and today.</p><p>“Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law. As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal.&#39;&quot; Apple said in a statement. &quot;Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.”</p><p>Offering an alternative payment system was at the heart of Epic&#39;s case against Apple. The former kicked off the legal fight in August 2020, when it informed <em>Fortnite </em>players on iOS and Android that they would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html">receive a discount</a> on in-game goods if they bypassed Apple and Google&#39;s payment systems. Both OS makers swiftly removed <em>Fortnite </em>from their app stores, and Epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sues-apple-195415590.html">sued</a> them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-google-play-lawsuit-035741548.html">both</a>. The Apple case <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tim-cook-apple-epic-testimony-221352974.html">went to trial in May</a>.</p><div id="7e350debce3f41edaa9751b73687173e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Epic has asked Apple to restore our Fortnite developer account. Epic intends to re-release Fortnite on iOS in Korea offering both Epic payment and Apple payment side-by-side in compliance with the new Korean law.</p>— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1436105346184056832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The ruling comes a day after Epic asked Apple to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-fortnite-ios-korea-050658329.html">restore its developer license</a> so it could once again offer <em>Fortnite </em>to iOS users in South Korea through the App Store. That country recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-law-app-store-alternative-payments-114504007.html">passed a law</a> that will require Apple and Google to allow other payment systems in their app stores, but it hasn&#39;t been rubber-stamped.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple refused Epic&#39;s request, stating that although it would welcome back the developer if it played by the same rules as everyone else, &quot;Epic has admitted to breach of contract and as of now, there’s no legitimate basis for the reinstatement of their developer account.&quot;</p><p>This injunction could mark a monumental change for the App Store ecosystem and Apple&#39;s business if it comes into effect. Developers would no longer have to fork over 30 percent of iOS app revenue to Apple, which could cost the company billions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-spotify-apple-complaint-eu-app-store.html">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-28-netflix-kills-apple-in-app-subscription.html">Netflix</a> are among the major companies who don&#39;t allow users to sign up for a subscription through their iOS apps, due to the cut Apple takes.</p><p>Despite the injunction, don&#39;t expect <em>Fortnite </em>to arrive back on the App Store just yet. It&#39;s highly likely that Apple will appeal that aspect of Judge Gonzales Rogers&#39; ruling.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e07d8e3-3972-4826-96b2-b49e8d616131</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:31:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631291313</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T16:28:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/c0a70c20-b547-11ea-9fdc-4371ffdac242" width="3816" height="2544" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/c0a70c20-b547-11ea-9fdc-4371ffdac242" width="3816" height="2544" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aly Song / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman looks at the screen of her mobile phone in front of an Apple logo outside its store in Shanghai, China July 30, 2017.

Now, the company is making the feature official: WhatsApp <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/">announced today</a> that all users will be able to encrypt backups of their chat history.</p><p>While WhatsApp messages have been encrypted since 2016, the app hasn’t offered end-to-end encryption of backups, which rely on iCloud or Google Drive. But with the latest update, users will be able to opt-in to end-to-end encryption for their backups before those backups hit their cloud storage service. Users can expect the update “in the coming weeks,” according to the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once end-to-end encryption is enabled, “neither WhatsApp nor the backup service provider will be able to access” the backup, WhatsApp writes in a blog post. Backups are encrypted with a “unique, randomly generated encryption key.” Users will then be able to choose between two options: manually storing the 64-digit key, or setting a password, which can be used to access the key.</p><p>While the feature certainly makes backups more secure, there are a few factors to keep in mind. The first is that opting in means there will be no way to recover your backup should you lose the 64-digit encryption key (you are able to reset the password if you forget it). Next is that even though WhatsApp recently announced support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-phone-multi-device-end-to-end-encryption-192123565.html">multiple devices</a>, you’ll only be able to create encrypted backups on your primary device.</p><p>It’s also worth pointing out that end-to-end encryption doesn’t guarantee your chats will never be used in a way you might not like. This week, <em>ProPublica</em> published a <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-facebook-undermines-privacy-protections-for-its-2-billion-whatsapp-users">lengthy story</a> on WhatsApp’s use of human moderators who review chats that are reported by WhatsApp users. And earlier this year <em>The Information</em> reported that Facebook may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-analyze-encrypted-messages-ad-targeting-175739715.html">researching</a> AI that could one day allow it to serve users ads based on encrypted messages (the head of WhatsApp <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1422611553954668546?s=20">denied</a> the messaging app was pursuing the technology). While neither of these “break” the security offered by encryption — and there are many very good reasons why people should be able to report abusive messages — it&#39;s a good reminder that privacy is about much more than just the presence of end-to-end encryption.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whats-app-end-to-end-encryption-for-backups-150954934.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e32adcb-6842-4231-b431-5d5275ca32a9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 15:09:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631293351</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T17:02:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/08ba9950-11cc-11ec-8cfe-33b03142298e" width="5500" height="3675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/08ba9950-11cc-11ec-8cfe-33b03142298e" width="5500" height="3675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Francis Mascarenhas / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man walks past a hoarding of the WhatsApp application installed at a skywalk in Mumbai, India, August 26, 2021.

The EQE shares many of the same design elements and features as the more-expensive EQS including the optional 6-inch Hyperscreen and rear-wheel drive.</p><p></p><h2>Mercedes-Benz EQG electric concept</h2><div id="02dc622e37844d57b815d5039d05d7f8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cJbA2g89YmM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Not stopping at sedans, Mercedes also unveiled a near-production concept version of the iconic G-Class aka, G Wagon. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-concept-eqg-eqe-175231108.html"><ins>EQG has the same distinctive look</ins></a> of the rugged, expensive offroader, but with a whole lot of lighting flourishes.&nbsp;</p><p>How many of those will make it to production is unknown, and there&#39;s also no word on what it’ll cost and how long its range will be. But if Mercedes can pull off with the G-Wagon what it did with the EQS then the future of offroading — or driving around while shopping for high-end clothing — will be electrified.</p><p></p><h2>BMW i Vision CIrcular Concept EV</h2><div id="52dc71c6e7094d39b596934c573f9562"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wu9Y8GaUy_M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>BMW already has two electric production vehicles, the i4 and iX, headed to the US. In Munich, it took the opportunity to unveil <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-recyclable-i-vision-cirulcar-concept-has-a-very-weird-crystal-interface-085205690.html"><ins>the i Vision Circular concept</ins></a><ins>,</ins> a vehicle that’s more about the future of manufacturing than it is about the future of driving. Built entirely out of recycled materials, the Circular is manufactured from mono-materials that are easy to recycle and take apart.</p><h2>Porsche Mission R electric concept race car</h2><div id="b4460ea063e643b7b832fc21b47390ac"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7wnwGRBloE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>For those excited about motorsports and the future of sports cars, the Porsche Mission R concept race car gave fans of the German brand a peek at what the future has in store. The all-wheel-drive vehicle uses a 900-volt architecture that supports DC fast charging at up to 340kW, and its battery is tuned for intense track days rather than cruising around town. While it’s currently a concept, the technologies found in the Mission R will likely make their way to the motorsports division and potentially into a future Cayman electric.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iaa-mobility-2021-munich-auto-show-video-143031508.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">29e3893d-cc7c-42b0-b81c-b1a1d416abe2</guid><dc:creator>Roberto Baldwin</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631283292</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T14:14:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Roberto Baldwin]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e333e3e0-1238-11ec-afde-7b43d1b9761c" width="1800" height="1197" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e333e3e0-1238-11ec-afde-7b43d1b9761c" width="1800" height="1197" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW i Vision Circular Circular Concept EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW i Vision Circular Circular Concept EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New 'Metroid Dread' trailer is full of things for Samus to fight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The long-awaited next entry in the Metroid series is just a few weeks away, and Nintendo has offered another taste of what’s in store for Samus with a new overview trailer. The five-minute <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-switch-gameplay-trailer-145519457.html"><em><ins>Metroid Dread</ins></em></a> clip delves into Samus’ abilities, the enemies she’ll face and more.</p><p>The trailer takes time to explain the moves Samus has in her tool belt, including the slide mechanic, her jumping prowess and a melee counter, which should come in very handy as long as you get the timing right. Unlockable abilities include targeting missiles, flash shift (a dash move), a tether to pull large obstacles out of the way and a way to morph into a ball to help Samus squeeze through narrow passages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="bf44586a4110460cbc0584913ec645ec"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-metroid-dread-release-date-163036346.html"><ins>Hunter robots called EMMI</ins></a> will pursue Samus if they hear or see her. If they catch Samus, it’s game over. Your best bet is to use her abilities to avoid detection, since you can’t damage them with regular weapons. The clip offers a look at some of the many, many other enemy types Samus will face on planet ZDR too.</p><p>The trailer also shows how <em>Metroid Dread</em> Amiibo will work, if you&#39;re fortunate enough to get your hands on them. If you tap Samus against your Joy-Con, you’ll gain an extra energy tank that increases your energy reserves. Use the EMMI Amiibo instead, and you’ll get another missile+ tank to boost missile capacity by 10. You can use each of these once per day to replenish resources.</p><p><em>Metroid Dread</em> arrives on Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-metroid-dread-release-date-163036346.html">on October 8th</a>. It’s the first mainline Metroid game since <em>Metroid Fusion</em> all the way back in 2002. Not much longer to wait now, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-overview-trailer-enemies-weapons-abilities-amiibo-141001527.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4824994e-4b6e-4a0e-b19f-42f28f59baa3</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 14:10:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631282480</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T14:01:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9860f9c0-123d-11ec-b27d-19fa596e5691" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9860f9c0-123d-11ec-b27d-19fa596e5691" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ MercurySteam/Nintendo EPD]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: iPhone 13 event preview, hands-on with Facebook's smart glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, Devindra and Cherlynn chat with Wired Reviews Editor Julian Chokkattu about Apple’s upcoming launch event on September 14th.

Those come in &quot;Aurora Night,&quot; &quot;Cloud Navy,&quot; &quot;Earth Sunrise&quot; and &quot;Dawn Atlas&quot; colors.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The color palette of the bands runs from violet to aqua blue to a mauve pink, along with the black and grey leather-look models. Those colors are all found in the watch faces as well, dubbed SMV Atlas I, SMV Serenity and SMV Atlas II.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;The collection draws inspiration from the beauty and colors of Mother Earth to serve as a reminder to prioritize mindfulness, health, wellness, and sustainability each day,&quot; Samsung wrote. That matches up with the Galaxy Watch 4&#39;s focus on health, with features that can measure oxygen, stress, water intake and sleep patterns. It also offers fitness features like guided workouts, group challenges and more.

Those who don&#39;t want to shell out $400 or more on a Series 6 have the $279 Apple Watch SE as an alternative. Now, you can spend even less and get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/2X77SaK">Watch SE</a> — Amazon has a couple of colors of the 40mm GPS version for $240, or about $40 off its normal price. We&#39;ve seen the Watch SE drop to $230 in the past, but this is the best price we&#39;ve seen in months. Most discounted models have automatically applied coupons, so you&#39;ll see the final price at checkout rather than on the product page.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2X77SaK" id="3edb02cbdf1a4245a6786ea6fa5103ca" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple Watch SE at Amazon - $240</a><p>We gave the Apple Watch SE a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">score of 88</a> when it came out last year thanks to its familiar design, solid performance and comprehensive feature set. It looks nearly identical to the Series 6, and although it&#39;s has a slightly older SiP on the inside, it still runs smoothly. But arguably the most important thing is that the Watch SE gives you all of the major features you&#39;d want from an Apple Watch including all-day heart rate monitoring with high and low heart rate alerts, built-in GPS, fall detection, Apple Pay support, Emergency SOS and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So where did Apple make cuts to bring down the Watch SE&#39;s cost? Mostly in advanced features. You won&#39;t find a blood oxygen sensor or an ECG tool on this wearable, and you also won&#39;t get the always-on display that the Series 6 has. Admittedly, those features will mean more to some users than others, so you may be able to safely skip them in order to save some money and get the same essential Apple Watch experience.</p><p>But it&#39;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-date-161123048.html">Apple&#39;s next event</a> is scheduled for September 14. While the new iPhone will likely be the headliner, we could see an updated Apple Watch as well. If you want the newest Watch, it may be worth it to wait and see what the company announces next week.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-se-is-on-sale-for-240-right-now-124054898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f808c831-b6e0-4ae5-bdd4-6b967b7475ff</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:40:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631277072</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T12:31:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/c08e3a04-ffa3-11ea-8ff7-6d1f87e27e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/c08e3a04-ffa3-11ea-8ff7-6d1f87e27e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch SE review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch SE review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steam update gives you more details about downloads and storage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steam has released an update that makes it easier to manage downloads and storage, move games from one drive to another and more. The tweaks have been available for months in beta, but are finally coming to all users in the stable release channel, the gaming service <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/2941402621044012222">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The downloads page has been cleaned up and now shows installation progress on top of download status. That fix will help you figure out when you can play a game after it has downloaded. You can also reorder the priority of downloads by dragging and dropping them when installing multiple titles. Finally, the rather undescriptive &quot;View News&quot; button has been renamed to Patch Notes so you can see what&#39;s changed in an update while it&#39;s downloading.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The storage manager has also been refreshed so you can more easily see how much space you have left in case you want to move a game to a less full or faster drive, for instance. It&#39;ll also let you remove empty library folders and mount library folders on read-only drives.&nbsp;</p><p>It also added minor tweaks and fixes to the Library, Friends List, Remote Play Together, Steam Cloud, Steam VR and other features. The new version should install itself automatically (barring any <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-30-steam-limits-game-auto-updates.html">COVID-related delays</a>), but you can check on the status via the menu bar.

Over the last few years, the company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">continued to refine</a> its mix of features and functionality, consistently creating some of the most reliable buds that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">do nearly everything well</a>. The one item still left on the agenda was a low-cost model: a set of earbuds that gave users good sound, handy tools and solid battery life for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:under $100" href="https://amzn.to/2YAU9sS">under $100</a>. With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">Elite 3</a>, the company does just that, and in the process it designed arguably its best true wireless product yet.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de100911-11ad-11ec-baff-1168b2af1547" alt="Jabra Elite 3 review" data-uuid="19775e97-fb25-32e4-85a0-e63120064e4b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>With its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">three new Elite models</a>, Jabra introduced an all-new design and made all of them smaller than its previous offerings. Until now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Elite 75t</a> was the company’s smallest set of earbuds. But the even more compact Elite 3 makes them more comfortable than the Elite 75t and the new shape, which Jabra is also using on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active</a>, better mimics the curves of your ear. Jabra says it used over 62,000 ear scans to create the shape by mapping the details of the average human ear. Instead of being more circular, the Elite 3 and its pricier siblings have a rounded triangular shell.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previous Jabra earbud models, up through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">Elite 85t</a>, all had a circle button for the on-board controls. A small triangular elbow that pointed down towards your face housed microphones. With the Elite 3, the button is a triangle now and covers the entire outer surface. All of the microphones are around the edge — one close to your face and the other up top. The inside of the earbuds are still the nozzle-like design Jabra has used in the past. So like a lot of the competition, there’s a good portion of each bud resting in your ear canal.</p><p>Like previous Jabra models, the on-board controls are physical buttons as opposed to touch panels. This means you actually have to press them, but it also means they’re more reliable. On the right side, you can play/pause (single press), skip tracks forward (double press), skip tracks backwards (triple press) and turn the volume up (press and hold). On the left, the same actions cover turning ambient sound on/off (single), activating your voice assistant (double) and volume down (press and hold). There’s nothing assigned to the triple press on the left earbud. Android users can also opt for quick access to Spotify, but you’ll have to replace the ability to summon your assistant.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de07a4a1-11ad-11ec-90a1-7c95125d1746" alt="Jabra Elite 3 review" data-uuid="45bcdbd7-63cf-38ce-b758-8818bcc13f2a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Everything that’s available as an on-board control is right on the buds already, so you don’t need to pick up your phone for the basics. And that means that during workouts, for which the Elite 3’s dust and water resistance is well-suited (IP55), you can quickly press a button and get right back to your exercise. The one key thing that is missing here is automatic pausing. It’s annoying, but lots of earbuds in this price range omit that feature so I wouldn’t consider it a dealbreaker.</p><p>The included charging case is almost identical to the one that came with the Elite 75t. It too is quite compact, easily tucking into a small pocket for transport. The Elite 3 case is noticeably lighter though and the materials used to make it feel a bit cheap. The lid in particular is a bit flimsy. Of course, if the case protects your earbuds and consistently keeps them charged, I’m willing to bet there won’t be many complaints.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de100910-11ad-11ec-9fea-a1d376a2df50" alt="Jabra Elite 3 review" data-uuid="ddab3278-c8fb-3401-a750-0a237e07bb50"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to audio quality with sub-$100 earbuds, you typically get muted, muffled sound that lacks any kind of depth or bassy thump. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html">Anker’s Soundcore line</a> is an exception to this, and now you can add Jabra to that list as well. I was immediately impressed with the Elite 3’s sound quality. The tuning is well-balanced, but the low-end tone booms when it&#39;s needed. The kick drum is deep and dynamic across rock tracks, and beats are energetic with hip-hop and electronic styles. Songs that were recorded to sound open and airy, like CHVRCHES’s “How Not To Drown” or John Mayer’s “Last Train Home,” are just that. Even the best-tuned cheap earbuds can have sound that feels compressed, and that’s far from the case on the Elite 3.</p><p>Jabra’s sound profile here is also adept at highlighting details. On the aforementioned CHVRCHES track, you can easily hear finer touches like the rattle of the snare drum. Little things like string noise and gritty guitar distortion throughout Chris Stapelton’s <em>Starting Over </em>add another dimension to the album. Even though Jabra only gives you a few presets to adjust the EQ with, it doesn’t matter: the Elite 3 outshines pricier competition with sound quality thanks to a mix of balanced tuning, punchy bass, great clarity and inviting depth.</p><p>The Elite 3 is equipped with ambient sound, or HearThrough as Jabra calls it, but the audio quality here isn’t as good as some more expensive sets. Don’t get me wrong, it does its job piping in the noises around you when you activate it. Things are muffled though, and the earbuds only pick up your voice when you’re on a call (sidetone). So for all the times you might want transparency, you still feel shouty when you’re having a quick chat IRL.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de07a4a2-11ad-11ec-86fe-0411f169ccbf" alt="Jabra Elite 3 review" data-uuid="3af0c269-db80-3c10-97ea-0bf18f16330e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Like a lot of headphones companies, Jabra promises “crystal-clear calls” with the Elite 3. And like much of the competition, that claim doesn’t pan out. These earbuds are perfectly serviceable for phone and video calls, but they’re far from “crystal clear.” You end up sounding like you’re on speakerphone, and there’s a dull roar in the background at all times. Does it get the job done? Yes. Do you sound great? No. Jabra does make up for its shortcomings with a few handy features, though.</p><p>First, the Elite 3 automatically switches to HearThrough mode on calls and you can enable sidetone to pipe in even more of your voice so you don’t feel the need to yell. There’s also a handy mute control on the earbuds, disabling the mics with a single press on either side. Lastly, Jabra has enabled a mono mode on this set, so you can use a single earbud at all times, even while the other is charging.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><p>The Elite 3 works with Jabra’s Sound+ app that supports a lot of its earbuds, headphones and headsets, but the options this time around are very limited. On the main screen, there’s the usual battery level percentage up top, a HearThrough (ambient sound) control and a collection of six audio presets. Unlike other Jabra models, there’s no manual EQ and obviously no noise cancellation control. HearThrough mode is also all or nothing, there’s no slider like there is for some of the company’s other earbuds.</p><p>If you dive further into the settings, the Elite 3 is compatible with Find My Jabra if you misplace an earbud and you can also activate sidetone during calls so you can monitor your own volume. When you’re on a call sidetone control will appear on the main screen for quick access. The on-board controls, however, are set and you can’t reconfigure them. Thankfully, Jabra covers the basics there, so you don’t really <em>need </em>to change anything. As I mentioned, you get a few additional options for the on-board controls with Android, but that’s the only difference from the iOS app. On Android devices, the Elite 3 also supports Google Fast Pair, which makes connecting to your phone a breeze.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Jabra promises up to seven hours of battery life on the earbuds themselves with an additional three charges in the case. This is slightly better than a lot of the competition these days, where many of those options hover around the five-hour mark. The case isn’t equipped with wireless charging, but there is a fast-charge feature that gives you an hour of use in 10 minutes.  During my tests, one of the Elite 3 buds died 15 minutes short of seven hours, while the other lasted 20 minutes past the stated time limit. If you’re docking these in the case a couple times, you should have no trouble getting a full workday and then some.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8a374e26-7f77-4fb8-a09a-9606bec2e454"/><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><p>At <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$80" href="https://amzn.to/2YAU9sS">$80</a>, Jabra has undercut much of the big-name true wireless competition. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">The cheapest AirPods</a> are $159, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2</a> will cost you $150 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-xb700-review-true-wireless-earbuds-163042660.html">Sony’s WF-XB700</a> is $130. Unless, of course, you can find any of those on sale. At full price though, affordable options from what I’d consider “the big three” are all more expensive than Jabra.</p><p>A worthy alternative to the Elite 3 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html">Anker’s Soundcore Spirit Dot 2</a>. They’re the same price as Jabra’s latest in a tiny, comfy form factor with punchy bass, on-board controls and an IPX7 rating. The Spirit Dot 2 offers five and half hours of battery life, though I only managed about four and a half during my review. There’s also no on-board volume controls, which could be a dealbreaker for some. The good news is Anker has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">a literal ton</a> of other affordable true wireless options, including the newer noise-cancelling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-air-2-pro-announced-price-specs-180002750.html">Liberty Air 2 Pro</a> with a more AirPod-like design.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>After covering the audio beat for years, it’s rare that I’m surprised by a set of earbuds. I typically have a good idea of what to expect before buds are in-hand and spec sheets rarely undersell products like these. With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/2YAU9sS">Elite 3</a>, I can honestly say Jabra exceeded my expectations. These are an incredible value for the price, mostly due to sound quality that is better than some of the competition that costs twice as much and an all-new design that’s both tiny and comfy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d98be8ba-acfc-40c3-a0c3-678de39c775b</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 12:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631279821</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T13:17:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/816dd930-11b7-11ec-9367-b944dabb6935" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/816dd930-11b7-11ec-9367-b944dabb6935" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 3 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 3 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Sony reveals 'God of War' and 'Spider-Man' sequels headed for PS5]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Good morning, there.

The glasses look stylish and the camera seems to take relatively decent video footage, but that Facebook connection….</p><p>You’ll need your phone nearby to do anything with the video and photos you capture, and there’s a small white LED that lights up when the glasses are recording. Yes, they are a bit heavier, and the cameras are noticeable up close, but from a distance, they could easily pass as any other pair of WayFarers. That’s the crux of these — they’re certainly a Facebook product, but it’s trying to hide that.

It&#39;s a low-cost 4G smartphone called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-jio-phone-next-india-125205560.html">JioPhone Next</a> that&#39;s designed to give more people in the mobile-first country access to the carrier&#39;s high-speed network. The companies have just announced, however, that they&#39;re pushing back the smartphone&#39;s launch by a couple of months.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the announcement, they&#39;ve made &quot;considerable progress&quot; with the phone and are currently testing it with a limited number of users. They&#39;ll make &quot;further refinement[s]&quot; as needed based on testers&#39; feedback and are working towards launching it in time for the Diwali festival scheduled for early November this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the companies didn&#39;t talk about the reason behind the delay at length, they did say that the additional time will &quot;help mitigate the current industry-wide, global semiconductor shortages.&quot; The global chip shortage caused mainly by factories closing due to the COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected tech and auto companies around the world. Automakers such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">Ford, BMW, Honda</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-halts-car-production-chip-shortages-200334864.html">GM</a> had to cut and suspend production due to the crisis. It&#39;s also the reason why Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-short-supply-through-2022-090543238.html">still can&#39;t</a> manufacture the PS5 in bigger quantities and why iPhone 12 shipments were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-confirms-iphone-12-delay-a-few-weeks-213946584.html">delayed</a> by a few weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-investment-jio-india-101523701.html">purchased</a> a $4.5 billion stake in Jio last year in hopes of expanding its presence in India, the companies revealed that they&#39;re planning to develop low-cost phones together. The JioPhone Next will have the capability to automatically read aloud and translate any onscreen text, such as text from messages, web pages, apps and photos. It&#39;ll also apparently feature a better camera than other similar low-cost phones, one with HDR support and with the capability to capture low-light images. Further, Snapchat augmented reality lenses, including India-centric filters, will be integrated into the camera. Finally, users will be able to ask Google Assistant to play music via Jio&#39;s streaming service Saavn or to check their balance on Jio&#39;s payments app.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-jio-jionext-phone-delayed-chip-shortage-092501299.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8735cfcd-62ae-4f65-883f-aa9e2fb86cb3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 09:25:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631263807</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T08:50:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce9208e0-120b-11ec-b17f-16107eaa2cbc" width="960" height="540" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce9208e0-120b-11ec-b17f-16107eaa2cbc" width="960" height="540" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google/Jio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google JioNext phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google JioNext phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests a way for accounts to let people know they're bots]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is testing a new label that lets automated bot self-identify as such in their labels, the company has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1436073604173770754">announced</a>.

That&#39;s mostly due to the fact that properly <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/dj-sets-livestreaming-economics-electronic-music-coronavirus/">sorting out royalties</a> for all the samples is a nightmare. You can find them on platforms like SoundCloud (unless they get taken down), but these songs can have literally hundreds of rights holders between the DJ, original artist, labels and even a festival or venue. To remedy the problem, and to massively expand the amount of DJ-mixed content on the platform, Apple worked with both major and independent labels on a system that identifies and directly pays rights holders on a mix. What&#39;s more, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-25-apples-purchase-of-shazam-is-400-million-well-spent.html">leveraged Shazam technology</a> to do it for Apple Music.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple explains that its new tool will let the streaming service ID and compensate individual creators in a DJ mix, even artists who recorded any sampled tunes. It&#39;s also the first major streaming service to do so. In collaboration with DJs themselves alongside festivals, clubs, promoters, curators and independent labels, the company says it&#39;s working with all parties involved to ensure fair compensation. Apple says this will give DJ mixes a longer shelf life when it comes to revenue since individual tracks, collections, compilations and even full festival sets will be available to stream like studio albums on Apple Music.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/boiler-room-brings-mixes-to-apple-music-touting-novel-royalty-model/">thousands of DJ mixes on Apple Music already</a>, and the service says it&#39;s adding more all the time. The company has already commissioned mixes for Black Music Month and Pride in addition to housing content from Tomorrowland&#39;s 2020 and 2021 digital festivals. Thanks to this new system, there&#39;s about to be a lot more to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting this Friday, !K7&#39;s DJ-Kicks archive will be available for streaming. The label explains that 14 of those editions haven&#39;t been &quot;in the market&quot; for more than 15 years. Previously unavailable for streaming, Tomorrowland performances from Alesso, Charlotte de Witte, David Guetta, Diplo, Major Lazer, Martin Garrix, The Chainsmokers, Tiësto and more will be easily accessible. Mixmag is opening up its vault as well, and livestream platform Cercle will have a dedicated hub on Apple Music where listeners can stream archived mixes and live performances. And yes, much of this will be available for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">lossless streaming</a> and you&#39;ll be able to listen offline too.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Apple has dabbled in managing royalties for DJ mixes. In 2016, the company began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-15-apple-music-remixes-dj-songs-dubset-mixbank.html">working with Dubset</a> to bring previously unlicensed content to Apple Music. Dubset used a Gracenote database of clips to identify and assign rights. The system even allowed original artists to prohibit their songs from being used in mixes and to limit how much of a track could be repurposed. Dubset was <a href="https://pex.com/blog/pex-acquires-dubset-media/">purchased by Pex in 2020</a>, where the system is used to scan social media audio and video content for unlicensed material. Apple&#39;s new Shazam-based setup, on the other hand, compares all parts of a mix to Apple Music&#39;s library of 75 million songs.</p><p>As you can imagine, all of the new content will be easy to find. Apple says DJs will have artist pages, if they don&#39;t already for any original music. And while the focus is on DJ mixes for now, the company says this system can be applied widely, for things like assigning royalties for hip-hop remixes and more.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dj-mixes-shazam-royalties-040033781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ce1cae7-47b5-4e71-bbde-6c05fdcac5c5</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 04:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631245841</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T03:50:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5f19a0-11ba-11ec-bbff-1bca0740ee2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5f19a0-11ba-11ec-bbff-1bca0740ee2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Music DJ]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Music DJ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vivo's X70 Pro+ does optical stabilization on all four rear cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/vivo">Vivo</a> brand may not immediately ring a bell in the West, but its recent mobile photography ambitions are worth paying attention to. The company&#39;s latest flagship, the X70 Pro+, is the world&#39;s first smartphone to feature optical image stabilization (OIS) across all four of its rear cameras. Like the <a href="https://www.vivo.com/en/products/x60proplus">previous model</a>, these all have Zeiss optics and Zeiss T* lens coating, but the main camera is further enhanced by an SLR-grade high-transmittance glass lens to reduce chromatic aberration.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d6117a0-119d-11ec-bbfd-9b10985f4e6a" alt="Vivo X70 Pro+ camera app" data-uuid="6504d06b-66e2-3d99-a6a2-dca28598f92c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>Vivo continues to offer one of the more versatile sets of cameras I&#39;ve seen lately. The X70 Pro+ comes with a 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera, which is further stabilized by Vivo&#39;s now-signature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-samsung-s20-ultra-review-comparison-153039220.html">micro gimbal</a>; a 50-megapixel f/1.57 main camera powered by a large <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-50-megapixel-dual-pixel-102059389.html">Samsung GN1</a> sensor (as featured on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-stabilization-152138632.html">X50 Pro+</a>); a 12-megapixel f/1.6 portrait camera with the much newer Sony IMX663; and an 8-megapixel f/3.4 5x zoom periscopic camera.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All four rear cameras support electronic stabilization for video shooting, and if you <em>really</em> want to, the main camera can film at up to 8K resolution. The X70 Pro+ also packs Vivo&#39;s very own &quot;V1&quot; AI imaging chip for better noise reduction in low-light video recording, as well as more efficient motion smoothing in video playback and gaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/18e79a30-119a-11ec-ae2c-f0992addd2b9" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I don&#39;t usually spend much time in the camera filter section, but Vivo&#39;s selection of bokeh effects look fun, as they were apparently meant to mimic classic Zeiss lenses. The X60 series already introduced the &quot;swirly&quot; Biotar filter, and with the new X70 series, you also get the &quot;anamorphic&quot; Distagon, the &quot;genuine&quot; Planar and the &quot;creamy&quot; Sonnar. Apparently Zeiss took part in developing these bokeh effects, so that should speak for their faithfulness.</p><p>On the other side of the X70 Pro+, you get a 32-megapixel f/2.45 punch-hole selfie camera at the top of a 6.78-inch screen. This 3,200 x 1,400 AMOLED panel offers better colors (10-bit or 1 billion colors) and brightness than before, thanks to Samsung&#39;s latest E5 LTPO tech. It also delivers a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a touch sampling rate of up to 300Hz, which should deliver some silky smooth scrolling and gaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d98b66f0-118f-11ec-a7fd-bffd859ed291" alt="Vivo X70 Pro+ display" data-uuid="b9b166d9-e55c-3e66-ab26-e1798429b599"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>The Android 11-based X70 Pro+ comes with many other flagship elements, namely a Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> processor, fast LPDDR5 RAM, IP68 dustproofing and waterproofing, stereo speakers and a dedicated Hi-Fi chip. There&#39;s even an infrared remote feature to let you control home appliances the old-fashioned way.</p><p>As for charging, the 4,500mAh battery here supports Vivo&#39;s 55W FlashCharge and 50W Wireless FlashCharge. The latter requires a special charging stand, which packs two coils to handle both portrait and landscape orientations. You can also use any Qi pad, with the trade-off being a slower charging rate, obviously. The phone itself does 10W reverse wireless charging, should you need to revive other phones, smartwatches or wireless earbuds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3bcaec00-1190-11ec-bf73-94505a8ddc8a" alt="Vivo X70 Series" data-uuid="9c9598d9-fa79-31a1-ac28-f07572a12d2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>The X70 series includes two other models: the quad-cam X70 Pro and the tri-cam X70. Both models are powered by MediaTek&#39;s Dimensity 1200-vivo chipset, and their smaller 6.56-inch AMOLED screens (2,376 x 1,080, 120Hz) translate to smaller batteries as well. But hey, you still get an infrared remote on either model.</p><p>While the X70 Pro and X70 also receive the Zeiss treatment, they baked the micro gimbal into their main cameras (50 and 40 megapixels, respectively) instead of their 12-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that their 12-megapixel portrait cameras lack OIS. Given their missing V1 imaging chip, it&#39;ll be interesting to compare their low-light shots with the X70 Pro+.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2a86de00-118f-11ec-8b4f-5cc18301cb46" alt="Vivo X70 Pro and X70 Pro Plus" data-uuid="f84c7e22-6f63-36fe-8474-c45cb3d4dd30"><figcaption>Vivo X60 Pro and X60 Pro+.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>For what it&#39;s worth, the version of the X70 Pro sold in China will be powered by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-first-five-nanometer-exynos-1080-120528283.html">Samsung Exynos 1080</a>, and it also includes a V1 chip.</p><p>Outside of China, Vivo&#39;s X70 series will initially roll out in markets like India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, among others. We currently only have China prices for reference: the X70 Pro+ starts from 5,499 yuan or about $854, the X70 Pro starts from 4,299 yuan or around $668, and the X70 starts from 3,699 yuan or around $575. There&#39;s no word on a European launch just yet, but Vivo might want to plan one soon to keep up with the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Oppo and Xiaomi</a>. Meanwhile, stay tuned for our upcoming X70 Pro+ hands-on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x70-pro-plus-zeiss-030033856.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d7dc56c-3e33-4a31-9741-ffb223de4ee7</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 03:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631263888</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T08:51:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/43a33480-1183-11ec-a4ff-9ae40785f095" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/43a33480-1183-11ec-a4ff-9ae40785f095" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivo X70 Pro+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivo X70 Pro+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple fires Ashley Gjøvik, senior employee who alleged sexism at work]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has fired <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senior-apple-employee-alleges-sexism-at-work-is-put-on-indefinite-leave-235626960.html">Ashley Gjøvik</a>, a senior engineering program manager who&#39;s been outspoken about her experiences working for the tech giant.

Further, she was discouraged from using the company Slack where she&#39;d been openly criticizing Apple.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-09/apple-s-watch-software-chief-takes-over-self-driving-car-project?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has tapped Kevin Lynch to oversee Project Titan following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hires-doug-field-204511159.html"><ins>departure of executive Doug Field</ins></a>, who left the iPhone maker for Ford earlier this week.&nbsp;</p><p>The name may not be familiar, but if you’ve watched any Apple event in recent years, you’ve seen Lynch on stage. After a stint at Adobe, he joined Apple in 2013 to oversee the company’s wearable and health unit and has frequently been the one to present whatever new features Apple is working on for watchOS.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports Lynch joined the division earlier in the year but is now overseeing the entire unit. The outlet notes Lynch’s appointment suggests Apple is likely focusing on underlying software that a self-driving car would need to navigate the road, instead of a vehicle that we could see the company release anytime soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-appoints-kevin-lynch-car-division-223033138.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d1effe3f-305c-4830-a38b-81e314333382</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 22:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631226046</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T22:20:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Board & Management Changes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5c413a0-11ba-11ec-a77d-6de66c43b016" width="3900" height="2600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5c413a0-11ba-11ec-a77d-6de66c43b016" width="3900" height="2600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRITTANY HOSEA-SMALL via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's vice president of technology Kevin Lynch speaks during the keynote address during Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California on June 3, 2019.
