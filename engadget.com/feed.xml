The company&#39;s CEO George Zhao told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/honor-ceo-wants-to-launch-5g-phone-in-2019-foldable-phone-in-2020/"><em>CNET</em></a> in 2019 that it was interested in building a folding phone, while its former parent Huawei recently released its third-gen folding device, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-reveals-the-mate-x-2-foldable-phone-141434144.html">Mate X2</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other details are scant, but a rumor from <a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=3064"><em>The Elec</em></a> stated that an upcoming Honor folding phone would use ultra-thin glass with an 8.03-inch folding display and 6.45-inch exterior screen. If accurate, that means it would be much like Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Fold 3</a> and not the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Galaxy Flip 3</a>.

Following the recent boom in NFT success stories (and millions being made), we have the other side of the coin. Ubisoft’s attempts to sell NFTs tied to its Ghost Recon gaming series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html"><ins>haven’t gone well</ins></a>. The games company  launched its own Quartz NFT platform to monetize game properties.</p><p>Alas, it seems Quartz has sold just 15 NFTs of a <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint </em>gun skin as of yesterday, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. As of yesterday, it appears to have sold two more M4A1 tactical weapons and one Wolf Enhance Pants #76 for a total of 18. According to their prices, that works out to about $1,755.30 in revenue. But Ubisoft appears to have minted about somewhere north of 3,000 NFTs, total. As many have noted, <em>Breakpoint</em> doesn&#39;t have the most alluring visual aesthetic — nor is it the biggest Ubisoft property — making it an odd choice to kick off Ubisoft’s NFT attempts.</p><p>In other news, CES is facing the Omicron threat, and many companies are withdrawing from exhibiting early January. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html"><ins>Amazon, Meta and several other big tech players</ins></a> will no longer have a presence at the show, citing the spread of the latest COVID-19 variant.

And, no, we don’t mean Chrome. As of today, the privacy-focused Vivaldi browser is available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html"><ins>Polestar 2 vehicles</ins></a>. It’s a first for Android Automotive and the company, which had yet to offer its software on vehicles before today.</p><p>Vivaldi says safety was one of its top priorities when porting the browser over to Android Automotive. To that end, it’s only possible to start a session when your car is parked. If you start streaming something and then resume driving, Vivaldi will limit the video to audio-only.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, privacy was also a priority for the team. The browser won’t store your browsing data on the car whenever you open a private tab. If you want to transfer your data between devices, you can do so by signing into your Vivaldi account. That information is something the company says Polestar won’t be able to access.</p><p>The Android Automotive version of Vivaldi is based on the company’s mobile release. You won’t find some functionality that is available in the desktop version – for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-accordion-tab-stacks-070000491.html"><ins>accordion tabs</ins></a> are missing – and Vivaldi has disabled a handful of other features. It’s not possible to download files and scan QR codes, for example. Otherwise, there aren’t many differences between the Android Automotive release and other versions of Vivaldi, and the company says updates will come at a regular cadence.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-android-automotive-polestar-2-120011646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3234f11c-cad0-44d3-a829-b98b045fff58</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639687188</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T20:40:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivaldi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[RadioShack is building a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RadioShack — yes, <em>that</em> RadioShack that used to sell electronic goods — is now a crypto business. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-05-radioshack-files-for-bankruptcy-as-sprint-eyes-its-stores.html">filed</a> for bankruptcy back in 2015 after 11 unprofitable quarters in a row, bringing it&#39;s almost 100-year history to an end. After that, the former retail chain&#39;s branding rights were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-13-radioshack-brand-sold.html">sold</a> several times until they were acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures Review (REV). If you visit <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/?sscid=c1k5_opb4u&amp;">RadioShack&#39;s website</a> right now, you&#39;ll see a banner talking about its new mission to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream. You&#39;ll also see a sign up section to be notified as soon as its RADIO token launches.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/radioshack-is-getting-into-the-crypto-business/"><em>CNET</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/radioshack-turns-to-crypto-with-radio-tokens"><em>Tom&#39;s Hardware</em></a> explain, RadioShack is building a Decentralized Finance ecosystem in partnership with the Atlas USV (Universal Store of Value) protocol. Atlas was designed by Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, who are also the duo behind REV. RadioShack&#39;s DeFi ecosystem will start with a decentralized exchange, which the company describes as the &quot;lowest hanging fruit that is full of opportunities&quot; on its website. When it&#39;s up, the DeFi exchange will allow users to send cryptocurrency directly to each other rather than through an exchange service like Coinbase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on what&#39;s written on RadioShack&#39;s website, REV is hoping that the &quot;100-year-old brand&quot; is embedded enough &quot;into the global consciousness&quot; to encourage widespread crypto adoption. It&#39;s even hoping that RadioShack could become the gateway for large corporations like Starbucks and Louis Vuitton to becoming blockchain companies. It&#39;s a lofty goal, especially for a brand that declared bankruptcy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-30-lawsuit-sprint-caused-radioshack-bankruptcy.html">twice</a> within the span of a few years.

Amazon, Meta, Twitter and T-Mobile have announced that they&#39;re no longer attending the event in person due to the threat brought about by the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The show earlier this year was a strictly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2021-what-to-expect-210017996.html">online-only affair</a>, but the Consumer Technology Association announced in April that the event is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-in-person-las-vegas-143003027.html">returning</a> as an in-person affair in 2022. While the organizer requires attendees to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-proof-of-vaccination-requirement-151808496.html">show proof</a> of vaccination to be able to attend the expo, the Omicron variant&#39;s emergence prompted companies to reconsider their plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=WJKVI5nK"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement that it&#39;ll no longer have an on-site presence at the event &quot;due to the quickly shifting situation and uncertainty around the Omicron variant.&quot; Its smart home subsidiary Ring will no longer be attending, as well. Meanwhile, Facebook parent company Meta said it won&#39;t be attending the expo in person anymore &quot;due to the evolving public health concerns related to COVID-19.&quot; It might participate in the event in a virtual capacity, but the company has yet to release more concrete details.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Similarly, Twitter has canceled its in-person appearance &quot;due to the spike in Covid cases across the country in the past week.&quot; It&#39;s reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-will-not-attend-ces-person-over-covid-19-concerns-2021-12-21/">exploring</a> ways to be able to participate virtually, as well. Even CES sponsor T-Mobile has chosen to step back and <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022">limit</a> its on-site participation. &quot;While we are confident that CES organizers are taking exhaustive measures to protect in-person attendees and we had many preventative practices in place as well, we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees with this decision,&quot; it said in a statement. Other companies that have chosen to cancel include <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/ces-2022-covid-19-omicron-cancel-facebook-meta-twitter-pinterest-drop-plans-2664407">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/ces-2022-tmobile-amazon-iheartradio-cancel-covid-1235141979/">iHeartRadio</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s still a lot of unknown factors surrounding the Omicron variant, but researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant.html">have found</a> it to be a highly transmissible strain. Further, what they&#39;ve discovered suggests that most non-mRNA vaccines (such as Sinovac and Sinopharm) offer almost no protection against the variant. At the moment, though, the CTA has yet to announce any changes to the event, and the in—person expo is still scheduled to take place in January.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e863d83-4663-4ffe-b9dd-19de39349a78</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:58:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640163529</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T08:58:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/01/20: In this photo illustration, a hand of a person holds a smartphone with a Consumer Electronics Show (CES) logo displayed in the background.

The company&#39;s new DualUp Monitor has an unusual 16:18 aspect ratio. It&#39;s a vertical display with a 2,560 x 2,880-pixel resolution that LG is calling &quot;Square Double QHD.&quot; When you use its vertical split view function, the DualUp looks like you put two 21.5—inch monitors on top of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be a better form factor than the typical monitor if you&#39;re constantly having to look at information on multiple windows or screens for work or for any other reason. In its announcement, LG says the model will help reduce side-to-side head movements that cause neck pain. DualUp was also meant to save space and will ship with the LG Ergo stand that clamps to most desks and tables. The Nano IPS monitor&#39;s other features include a brightness of 300 nits, a 1000:1 contrast ratio and HDR10 support.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to DualUp, LG has also introduced the UltraFine, a 32-inch 4K UHD monitor. It has a more conventional aspect ratio, but it is the first to use LG&#39;s Nano IPS Black panel technology, which enables a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The company will reveal more about both premium monitors at its virtual press event on January 4th. It&#39;s unknown at this point whether LG will still push through with a physical experience at CES 2022, assuming the event will still take place despite the threat posed by the Omicron variant. It was planning on showcasing a list of new items during the conference aside from these monitors, though, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html">soundbar</a> with a center up-firing speaker, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">wireless TV on wheels</a> and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED TV with a motorized cover</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-dualup-monitor-051303157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b44c61f8-811b-41df-90f8-324bbfc46e46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 05:13:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640149986</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T05:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Both the LG UltraFineâ¢ Display (model 32UQ85R) and LG DualUp Monitor (model 28MQ780) offer sleek and practical designs, enhanced connectivity and superior user experience for both home and office workers, including creative professionals and programmers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG-DualUp-Lifestyle-00]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Voice now lets you decide who goes to voicemail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google now lets you customize how its Voice service <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/set-custom-rules-for-incoming-google-voice-calls.html">handles incoming calls</a>.

The company has <a href="https://tascam.com/us/magazines/detail/866">introduced</a> a 424 Studio Master High Bias Type II Cassette designed for the brand&#39;s decades-old Portastudio four-track cassette recorders.

Tascam said it&#39;s using existing magnetic oxides to produce tape that&#39;s as close &quot;as possible&quot; to the material Portastudios were meant to use, but recorder owners may still have to do some &quot;fine tuning&quot; to adjust for 2021-era cassettes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, this isn&#39;t just an appeal to nostalgia — to some extent, it&#39;s about the preservation of analog cassette recording.

While there are tapes already on the market, they&#39;re both rare and expensive.</p><p>Availability is only listed as &quot;soon.&quot; Tascam&#39;s cassettes also won&#39;t satisfy creators who want genuinely new recorders to replace a shrinking supply of old hardware. This might be the next best thing, though, and could be a relief for Portastudio fans who don&#39;t want to make a complete leap into the digital realm.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tascam-new-cassettes-old-four-track-recorders-202319184.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b884cc1-1287-443a-96d4-fbafd4e594b9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 20:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640119434</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T20:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e380e250-6290-11ec-a66a-0fbf003e302b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tascam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tascam 424 Studio Master Cassette]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' final commemorative Xbox sneakers are now on sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html"><ins>October</ins></a>, Microsoft and Adidas have been releasing commemorative Xbox-themed sneakers to mark the brand&#39;s 20th anniversary. It all started with a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-sneakers-20th-anniversary-142654989.html">Forum Tech</a> shoes the two companies gave away to a group of lucky fans. Then, in November, they released a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-xbox-360-forum-mid-155422425.html"><ins>Xbox 360-themed Forum Mid</ins></a> sneakers you could buy in the US and Canada. Now, for their third and final drop, the two have come out with an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/12/21/xbox-series-x-adidas-sneaker/"><ins>Xbox Series X-inspired design</ins></a> that&#39;s available to purchase worldwide.</p><p>This time around, Microsoft and Adidas say they went with the Tech Boost silhouette because, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-ps5-one-year-review-194023408.html">Xbox Series X/S</a>, it&#39;s a design that acknowledges the past while incorporating new technologies. As with the other sneakers in the series, you&#39;ll find plenty of clever references. For instance, the inner lining of the shoes draws on the design of the Xbox Series X&#39;s vents. Meanwhile, the heel and sole of shoes mirror the grips of the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Overall, we wanted to create a shoe that cemented a moment in time, but also felt timeless,&quot; Microsoft said. &quot;This is a shoe that is meant to be played in, meant to be worn, and meant to be enjoyed by our community – one that&#39;s always played in, and never played out.&quot;</p><p>You can buy the Xbox Series X Forum Tech Boost from the <a href="https://www.adidas.com/us/xbox-forum-techboost-shoes/GW6374.html">Adidas website for $140</a>. If you&#39;re not a sneakerhead, Microsoft has released other commemorative products to mark the console&#39;s 20th birthday, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-transluscent-controller-160707355.html"><ins>translucent controller</ins></a> that pays homage to the original Xbox debug kit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xbox-adidas-xbox-series-x-sneakers-193013642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35bf698a-7004-4f09-99f0-f644b61a4af7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:30:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640114066</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T19:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4615a8c0-6290-11ec-bcb7-9651aed11b6d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft / Adidas]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forum Tech Boost]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo offers a first look at its desktop web browser]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/duckduckgo/"><ins>DuckDuckGo</ins></a> has offered an early peek at its upcoming desktop app. In <a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-2021-review/"><ins>a blog post</ins></a> that recaps the company&#39;s year, CEO Gabriel Weinberg looked toward the future as well. He said DuckDuckGo will bring the privacy protections the company is known for to the app. You can expect the speed and simplicity of its mobile app too.</p><p>&quot;Robust privacy protection&quot; will be enabled by default for search, browsing, email and more. Weinberg said the app isn&#39;t a &quot;privacy browser&quot; per se, but rather &quot;an everyday browsing app that respects your privacy.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it did on mobile, DuckDuckGo is building the app using OS-provided rendering engines instead of basing it on projects like Chromium. According to Weinberg, that helped the development team to &quot;strip away a lot of the unnecessary cruft and clutter that’s accumulated over the years in major browsers.&quot;</p><p>Along with a streamlined interface and the Fire Button (which closes all tabs and wipes browsing data in a single tap), the DuckDuckGo desktop is cleaner and much more private than Chrome, Weinberg said. He also claimed it&#39;s &quot;significantly faster&quot; than Google&#39;s browser, based on early tests — here&#39;s hoping it&#39;s less of a memory hog than Chrome too. DuckDuckGo didn&#39;t reveal when it plans to release the desktop app.</p><p>Weinberg notes that, over the last 12 months, DuckDuckGo has bolstered its search and tracker blocking features. He said DuckDuckGo&#39;s mobile app is now the most downloaded Android browser in key markets. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-email-protection-tracking-pixels-privacy-151024634.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> a free email forwarding service that removes tracking pixels from messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/duckduckgo-desktop-app-browser-privacy-184913408.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da314e59-b769-4a7a-aaf2-80a878aa8f73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 18:49:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640112556</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T18:49:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/07244110-628d-11ec-b5db-ed59f33baaf1" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DuckDuckGo's desktop and mobile apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey caused an uproar with a bizarre Web3 Twitter rant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the internet’s most vocal proponents of Bitcoin voiced an unusually uncharacteristic opinion against Web3 this week.

With the help of technologies like blockchain, they argue the internet will become a more decentralized entity, free of the institutional players that have dominated it since the early days of the platform. Investment firms like Andreessen Horowitz have been some of the most vocal supporters of companies in the space. As of October, the firm had set aside <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/13/vc-firm-andreessen-horowitz-to-make-crypto-policy-push-in-washington.html"><ins>$3.1 billion</ins></a> to invest in crypto and Web3 startups. “It’s somewhere between a and z,” Dorsey said, referencing “a16z,” its nickname when Tesla CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1473165759224463360?s=20">joined the conversation</a> to ask if “anyone has seen web3?”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8902b79018c6427599e213f9ee8fbc0a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have bigger issues if a tweet stifles hopes and dreams.

As of the writing of this article, the post has attracted more than 5,000 retweets, 2,000 quote tweets and 31,000 likes. Naturally, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/style/article/nft-accidentally-bored-ape-sold-intl-scli/index.html">Bored Ape contingent </a>showed up to tell Dorsey he was “dead wrong,” but just as many people came to offer support, calling him “based” for his tweet.</p><p>For all the buzz Dorsey’s tweet generated, there’s a kernel of truth to what he said. On Monday, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-one-percent-controls-lions-share-of-the-cryptocurrencys-wealth-11639996204"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, citing a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research, determined 0.01 percent of those who hold Bitcoin control 27 percent of the digital currency.

That&#39;s a not-so-subtle dig at the onslaught of reboots and remakes dominating our culture — revisiting characters and stories we already know is, well, safe. Audiences know what to expect, and it&#39;s a better bet for risk-averse studios. Of course, Morpheus (now played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen) is also commenting on the film he&#39;s in.</p><p>More than twenty years after <em>The Matrix</em> fundamentally reshaped genre cinema, director Lana Wachowski is finally diving back into the universe that made her and co-director Lilly Wachowski renowned. After all that time, is it really worth going back down the rabbit hole, or is this just another easy franchise cash-grab?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The answer to that question depends on what you want from a <em>Matrix </em>sequel. Like <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em> and <em>Revolutions </em>before it, Wachowski (along with co-writers David Mitchell and Aleksander Hemon) isn&#39;t interested in merely retreading the past with <em>Resurrections</em>. Instead, it&#39;s a film that&#39;s keenly aware of its legacy, our relationship with its characters, and the lofty expectations that fans (and studios!) have when rebooting a beloved property.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d252-626c-11ec-9ffb-6eb31f3af5eb" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="6731a42e-5529-369a-953b-b6b815399259"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>As someone who adored the original film, and found plenty to respect in the much-maligned sequels, <em>Resurrections</em> feels made just for me. It&#39;s intoxicating, thrilling and unabashedly romantic. But judging from the polarizing early critical responses, it&#39;s clearly not for everyone.</p><div id="23e3dca2e84a4e2999cefc4162bf8f87"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ix7TUGVYIo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><strong><em>Minor spoilers ahead.</em></strong></p><p>It&#39;s hard to talk about what <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> is without describing its basic setup, most of which you can gather from the film&#39;s trailers. Keanu Reeves returns as Thomas Anderson, a programmer adrift in a world that doesn&#39;t quite make sense to him. He meets a woman played by Carrie-Anne Moss, but this time she&#39;s not the Agent-whupping bad-ass Trinity, she&#39;s just your typical (albeit, strikingly beautiful) mom. The two feel an instant connection. Thomas eventually gets ripped out of the world he&#39;s in thanks to a plucky new character named Bugs (Jessica Henwick), he finds the real world, and <em>yadda yadda</em>, you get the picture.</p><p>Now, you might be asking yourself, &quot;Didn&#39;t Neo and Trinity die in <em>The Matrix Revolutions?&quot; </em>All I can do is point at the title of the movie — what did you expect? This time, Anderson is a renowned game developer known for creating an popular trilogy of games that retell the entire <em>Matrix</em> story. When we first meet him, he&#39;s faced with a new challenge: making a fourth entry. He approaches it with the same sense of dread the Wachowskis likely felt about tackling a potential <em>Matrix 4</em>. A series of brainstorming scenes feel as if they&#39;re pulled directly from their own hellish meetings with Warner Bros. Anderson&#39;s team can only focus on the surface — How do they go beyond bullet time? What if they just focus on more mindless action? — rather than anything truly substantive.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6608d6c96de34f6c857fcefc7a348e92" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-bacb-dfd87aec35f5" alt="Neo vs. Morpheus. inThe Matrix Resurrections"></section><p>As the film unfolds (and don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not revealing any  major surprises), it&#39;s  impressive how Lana Wachowski elegantly avoids the traps most reboots fall into, as if she were in the Matrix herself, deftly avoiding all of the bullets aimed right at her. Sure, <em>Resurrections</em> brings some new special effects toys to the party, and it has the requisite action scenes you&#39;d expect. But in many ways it&#39;s more reminiscent of the Wachowski&#39;s recent works, like the time-hopping epic <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, and the unabashedly humanistic <em>Sense8</em>.</p><p><em>The Matrix Resurrections </em>wears its heart on its sleeve. It&#39;s far more interested in the transcendental possibilities of love than it is in laying the groundwork for a new trilogy of films. The fact that Wachowski is practically refusing to play by the current rules of Hollywood – set up the sequel by any means necessary! – feels almost revolutionary. She has one story to tell, and it means a lot to her. That’s it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3341e7f0-626c-11ec-9fef-39dad80f80d4" alt="The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="42032915-0055-3d23-8122-50308f99a39d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>Strangely enough, the movie <em>Resurrections </em>reminds me of most is Wes Craven’s <em>A New Nightmare</em>, a groundbreaking attempt at wrestling with a hugely popular genre franchise. That film – the seventh<em> A Nightmare on Elm Street </em>entry – brought Freddy Krueger into the real world to reclaim what made him terrifying. Throughout <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, it feels as if Wachowski is also ready to break the fourth wall with her sheer contempt for reboots, fan service and watered-down sequels. “The sheeple want control, certainty,” a villain says at one point. (At that moment, I couldn’t help but think of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html">utter failure of <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em></a><em>. </em>Yes, the wound is still fresh.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342d250-626c-11ec-a7f7-0cdb34fc728d" alt="Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss in The Matrix Resurrections" data-uuid="541f946b-509a-3665-a268-55332506d96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>And this is where I come back to saying this movie isn’t for everyone. But that just makes it a <em>Matrix</em> sequel. Sure, <em>Reloaded</em> and <em>Revolutions</em> were a bit overstuffed and convoluted, but they were also  singular visions that took some major swings. (I’m still chasing the high of seeing <em>Reloaded’s </em>sprawling highway chase for the first time.)</p><p>Geek cinema has taken over the world, yet aside from Christopher Nolan’s work, it’s rare to see big-budget filmmaking that isn’t beholden to some major corporation’s franchise rules (and at this point, that’s usually just Disney). <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> says “to hell with the rules!”, and I applaud it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-review-160043378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3bbc5ef-0b6d-48a7-8af8-8870c1adf46f</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640119512</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T20:45:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342ab40-626c-11ec-bef0-e696b679353b" width="2000" height="1041" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3342ab40-626c-11ec-bef0-e696b679353b" width="2000" height="1041" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Matrix Resurrections]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Matrix Resurrections]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arturia is giving away a free lo-fi tape plug-in for the holidays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s become something of a holiday tradition for Arturia to give away a free plugin for the holidays. Last year it took its recreation of the iconic chorus from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-jun-6-chorus-roland-juno-synth-plugin-free-080042654.html">Juno-6</a> and turned it into a stand alone effect. This year, it&#39;s breaking out the tape effects from its Mellotron emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>The original Mellotron is, of course, an iconic keyboard that played back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-21-mellotron-walkman-keyboard-crudman.html">tape loops</a> of other instruments — kind of like a proto-sampler. Arturia caught wind that some artists were using their Mellotron V plugin in an unexpected way. They were loading custom samples in and, rather than playing them back as a melody with the keyboard, simply adding the warmth and vibe of the simulated tape loops.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So this holiday season Arturia decided to just cut out the middleman and release Tape Mello-Fi as a standalone tape simulator plugin. It can add distortion, saturation, tape flutters and even some filtering. Its interface is simple and delivers everything from subtle warmth to full on machine malfunctions. There are even 25 presets included to get you started.</p><p>Of course, there are <em>tons</em> of lo-fi and tape simulation plugins out there. But Arturia&#39;s is particularly good. And, it&#39;s free. So there&#39;s really no reason not to grab it. And you should do it sooner than later. Tape Mello-Fi will be available as a free download from <a href="https://www.arturia.com/">Arturia&#39;s site</a> from December 21st through Friday December 31st. After that, well, who knows.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-free-tape-mello-fi-plugin-christmas-160020059.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ca1c117-f83b-4e19-b877-1fa788979dc0</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640023370</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T18:02:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e3cf4e50-61bd-11ec-9f2c-35d63e9f3298" width="2000" height="1235" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia Tape Mello-Fi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researcher hacked an at-home COVID-19 test to give bogus results]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/find-out-if-you-have-covid-from-the-comfort-of-your-own-home-173043438.html">At-home COVID-19 tests</a> might not be as trustworthy as you&#39;d hope — not in the hands of a committed hacker, at least.

Although the effort currently involved makes that fraud unlikely on a large scale, it wouldn&#39;t take many bogus results to lead to outbreaks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ellume-covid-19-test-bluetooth-hack-153933652.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb49f65d-a775-44c0-bfb4-2083f2b6910e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 15:39:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640101177</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T15:40:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fc900650-626c-11ec-9f77-a1607aba3a45" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fc900650-626c-11ec-9f77-a1607aba3a45" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ellume]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ellume at-home COVID-19 test]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ellume at-home COVID-19 test]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First full asteroid return sample confirms early Solar System origins]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have finally studied their first full samples returned from an asteroid in space, and they confirm what you&#39;d expect — while providing some new insights. <em>ScienceAlert</em><a href="https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-have-analyzed-ancient-stardust-collected-from-asteroid-ryugu">reports</a> researchers have released <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01550-6">two</a><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-021-01549-z">papers</a> revealing their first analysis of samples <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jaxa-subsurface-samples-asteroid-ryugu-180000988.html">from Ryugu</a>, the space rock the Hayabusa2 probe visited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-japan-hayabusa2-touch-down-bullet-samples.html">in February 2019</a>. The team knew Ryugu would be a common, carbon-rich C-type asteroid, but that still makes it a good peek at the ingredients of the early Solar System.</p><p>The sampling indicates Ryugu has a carbon-dominated composition similar to the Sun&#39;s photosphere (outer shell), much like certain meteorites. It&#39;s made of the most primitive materials in the Solar System, emerging from the dust disc that formed along with the Sun itself. It&#39;s also quite porous, like many asteroids. However, it&#39;s not quite a neat and tidy example. Most C-type asteroids have a low albedo (solar radiation reflectivity) of 0.03 to 0.09 due to their carbon, but Ryugu&#39;s is 0.02. It&#39;s dark even by the standards of its cosmic neighbors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As it stands, the very existence of these studies represents an achievement. The first attempt to return a sample, from the astroid Itokawa in 2010, only netted a tiny amount of dust.

With people stuck at home last year, services saw millions of new subscribers — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">Netflix attracted 16 million customers in just three months</a>, alone. The early part of 2021 continued that trend, but as the year draws to a close, it appears <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-netflix-and-other-streaming-services-subs-arpu-q3-2021.html">the growth is slowing down across the board</a>. This suggests that as restrictions ease around the world, people might be returning to pre-pandemic norms.</p><p>But on the whole, 2021 was still a pretty big year for streaming. Netflix now has <a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/netflix-now-has-214-million-global-subscribers/">214 million global subscribers</a>, and services like Disney+ and HBO Max lured customers with exclusive TV shows and movies. US platforms, like Peacock, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-uk-ireland-sky-now-tv-streaming-164859612.html">expanded internationally</a> and online-only programming was well-represented at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-beats-all-studios-with-seven-oscars-064216443.html">multiple award shows</a>. Titles exclusive to streaming, such as <em>Squid Game</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, became part of the cultural landscape. A slow year or not, it’s clear that this is how most of us watch our shows now. Here are some of the biggest stories in streaming this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/efcc47a0-5efa-11ec-bfdd-2e3905269833" alt="Squid Game" data-uuid="a652d448-7ba3-3d4d-bfef-0b741805a14f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><h3>Netflix continues to dominate</h3><p>As mentioned above, Netflix is the undisputed leader in streaming with over 214 million subscribers worldwide. Sure, it’s faced a few challenges from rivals like Disney+ and Amazon Prime, but Netflix is still holding strong. Part of that is due to the company’s strategy of investing in original content that you can’t get anywhere else, like <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>The Crown</em>.</p><p>And of course, there’s <em>Squid Game</em> which is undoubtedly the number one TV show of the year. Netflix has said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html">around 142 million households</a> watched the Korean-language show, making it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history. There’s also the recently released <em>Red Notice</em>, which became <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/red-notice-netflix-all-time-most-popular-movie-1235118477/">the service’s most-watched movie</a> in its first 28 days of release, with around 328.8 million viewing hours in that time span. That tops the previous record held by <em>Bird Box</em>, which had 282 million viewing hours back in 2018.</p><p>Things don’t seem to be slowing down, either. Netflix has signed multi-year deals with big names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-kevin-hart-agree-to-a-multiyear-film-deal-231147872.html">Kevin Hart</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steven-spielberg-netflix-ambiln-175031862.html">Steven Spielberg</a>, it has exclusive rights for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Universal animated films</a> and it purchased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-reportedly-purchasing-the-rights-to-roald-dahls-entire-catalog-091947985.html">the rights to Roald Dahl’s entire catalog</a>. this phenomenon</p><p>Still, 2021 wasn’t without its hiccups. The largest one by far is when Netflix employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">staged a protest</a> over the CEO’s remarks defending Dave Chappelle’s standup special, which was heavily criticized for its transphobic content. CEO Ed Sarandos has since said he “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-internal-communication-over-dave-chappelle-special-080412118.html">screwed up</a>” on the messaging, but has not rescinded his defense.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d61bda60-5ef9-11ec-bfbd-1813cc4e3f80" alt="Loki" data-uuid="c1462c7d-056a-3e8f-a51a-2882e662904f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><h3>Disney+ proves it’s a serious contender</h3><p>Disney+, on the other hand, currently has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html">118.1 million</a> paid subscribers worldwide, which doesn’t quite compare to Netflix. But the service still gained ground in 2021, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/disney-plus-number-of-subscribers-us/">around 43 million more subscribers</a> compared to last year. A lot of that can be attributed to Disney’s powerhouse brands such as Pixar, Star Wars and, especially in 2021, Marvel.</p><p>2021 was when the Marvel Cinematic Universe released four different TV shows, all exclusively on Disney+: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-first-episode-marvel-universe-153051805.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-hawkeye-trailer-premiere-date-clint-barton-kate-bishop-hailee-steinfeld-140006373.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a>. This is a big deal, as Marvel has said that these TV series are key to the MCU’s “Phase Four” chapter, indicating that fans will likely want to watch them in order to understand the context behind upcoming movies set in the same universe.</p><p>But there was more to these shows that made them required viewing. As the first out the gate, <em>WandaVision</em> set the tone. The episodes were meant to be watched weekly, as each one spurred so-called “water cooler” discussions in-person and online. This felt a lot like “anti-binging” TV, as much of the appeal of these shows lay in the anticipation of what would happen next. At the very least, it showed that Disney+’s slate of original content — which also includes <em>The Mandalorian</em> and the upcoming <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> — could hold its own against that of more established platforms.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/98823320-5ef9-11ec-bb6b-355061f8bb40" alt="Wonder Woman 1984" data-uuid="506c6720-7300-393d-9af3-636095e4481a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. </div></figure><h3>The direct-to-streaming revolution that wasn’t</h3><p>During the thick of the pandemic, many movies eschewed theatrical releases for direct-to-streaming debuts. Examples include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-22-paramount-the-lovebirds-direct-to-netflix.html"><em>The Lovebirds</em></a>, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/g31871914/movies-streaming-early-coronavirus/"><em>Borat Subsequent Movie Film</em>,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-date-232629863.html"><em>Mulan</em></a> (via paid Premier Access), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em>Soul</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wonder-woman-hbo-max-december-25-234420280.html"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a>. That carried into this year as well, with Disney+ continuing its paid Premier Access model with <em>Cruella</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-184407477.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a> (<em>Luca</em>, however, did not have Premier Access release).</p><p>The biggest move, however, was when Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its movies in 2021 would have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html">one month exclusive access period on HBO Max</a> concurrent with the film’s domestic release. This meant that big blockbuster movies like <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Dune</em> and <em>Matrix 4</em> would be available on HBO Max on the same day they debuted in theaters <em>for an entire year</em>.</p><p>While some may have heralded this phenomenon as the future of entertainment, it looks to be short-lived. Disney revealed a few months ago that all of its remaining 2021 movies will get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">45-day head start</a> in theaters. This could be due to strong responses to titles like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>, but Disney might also want to avoid lawsuits like the one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">Scarlett Johansson filed</a> for breach of contract over shortened theatrical releases. Warner Bros. also said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">it’s going back to theater-first releases in 2022</a>. It looks like the direct-to-streaming revolution isn’t quite here just yet.</p><h3>Other notable streaming news</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-launch-date-161702061.html">Paramount+ replaces CBS All Access</a>, which essentially opens up the service to other ViacomCBS channels, such as Comedy Central and VH1, plus Paramount’s existing movie library.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discovery-plus-now-available-roku-amazon-fire-181032400.html">Discovery+ makes its debut</a>. The service features content from HGTV, Food Network, Animal Planet, TLC, the Magnolia Network, and Discovery.</p></li><li><p>AT&amp;T spun off its WarnerMedia division and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-spins-off-warner-media-in-a-merger-deal-with-discovery-123716979.html">merged it with Discovery</a> in a $43 billion deal. The new company will combine Warner’s film division, HBO Max and Discovery+.</p></li><li><p>Roku purchased Quibi’s shows and released some of them as “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-originals-quibi-may-20th-streaming-day-130016440.html">Roku Originals</a>.”</p></li><li><p>Roku <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-removes-youtube-tv-google-contract-dispute-143232936.html">pulled YouTube TV</a> from its channel store amid a contract dispute with Google. The latter apparently requested priority placement in search results and wanted to block results from other providers while the app was in use. As of December 8th, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-is-finally-coming-back-to-roku-after-after-a-protracted-feud-140010882.html">both parties have finally agreed</a> to a multi-year extension.</p></li><li><p>In other notable YouTube TV news, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-loses-access-to-disney-channels-083536190.html">the service recently lost access to all of Disney&#39;s channels</a>, which includes ESPN, ABC and FX, as Google and Disney had failed to strike a deal. After just a couple of days, however, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-disney-channels-back-espn-abc-213518747.html">two companies reconciled and reached an agreement</a>, thus restoring all of the aforementioned channels. When YouTube TV initially lost those channels, Google had dropped the price of the service by $15 (from $65 to $50 in the basic package). Now the price is back to normal. However, if users had already initiated the cancellation process, Google will still honor the one-time $15 credit if they resume their membership.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">WWE Network</a> ceased operations as most of its content moved to Peacock.</p></li><li><p>Peacock aired multiple live <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">Olympics</a> sporting events as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.</p></li><li><p>Universal made a deal where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">Peacock</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html">Amazon Prime Video</a> would have some streaming rights for its live-action movies after their theatrical run.

Netflix has confirmed that the aforementioned <em>Sandman</em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=netflix+2022+witcher+blood+origin+stranger+things&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS908US908&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvIrIpB7grzhtMZBytqeZtg5N9SOUA%3A1639540764819&amp;ei=HGi5Yd-zMdi7tAbdlarIAw&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfsYan9eT0AhXYHc0KHd2KCjkQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=netflix+2022+witcher+blood+origin+stranger+things&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKsCMgUIIRCrAjIFCCEQqwI6BwgAEEcQsAM6CAghEBYQHRAeOgUIIRCgAUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFDuA1i5DGCiDWgBcAJ4AIABggGIAbANkgEENS4xMZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">will be released in 2022</a>, as well as <em>The Witcher: Blood Origin</em> and new seasons of favorites like <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>The Crown</em> and <em>Ozark</em>. Disney+ will continue its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-disney-plus-ms-marvel-she-hulk-moon-knight.html">MCU run of TV shows</a> with <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, and will introduce a couple of Star Wars series too: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-obi-wan-kenobi-baymax-173811314.html"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> and <em>Andor</em>. Perhaps the two biggest TV series to get excited about, however, are HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series, <a href="https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, and Amazon’s epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> series</a>, which is set thousands of years prior to <em>The Hobbit</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/state-of-streaming-2021-143056372.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3a0688c-cd26-4dda-b21d-92e419e90250</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640119571</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T20:46:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d923a6b0-5efa-11ec-bfbd-c53624d39063" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d923a6b0-5efa-11ec-bfbd-c53624d39063" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - NOVEMBER 13 2021: Workers dressed like characters in the Netflix series Squid Game pose to entertain visitors in a shopping mall in Yantai city in east China&#039;s Shandong province Saturday, Nov. 13, 2021.

Now, it appears that the effort is a financial bust so far, too, as the company reportedly sold just 15 NFTs of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-players-can-invite-friends-to-join-them-for-free-212500525.html"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> gun skin as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-20-ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> reported. It appears to have sold <a href="https://rarible.com/ubisoft-quartz/activity?types[]=sale">two more</a> M4A1 tactical weapons and <a href="https://objkt.com/collection/ubisoftquartz">one</a> &quot;Wolf Enhance Pants #76&quot; for a total of 18 as of today.&nbsp;</p><p>Apex Legends senior character artist Liz Edwards tweeted that she looked at the two third-party marketplaces linked to the Quartz sites &quot;and there seems to be... 15 sales in total?&quot; That works out to about $1,755.30 in revenue, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-20-ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> noted. As of today, Ubisoft appears to have minted about somewhere north of 3,000 NFTs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="af45465962ac489cb4d59d2b315076fc"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">am i understanding this right? ubisoft managed to make an nft that not even nft fans want? because that is very very very funny</p>— Liz Edwards (@lizaledwards) <a href="https://twitter.com/lizaledwards/status/1472785306889773056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Ubisoft launched the first three <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> Editions for free, with the weapon requiring XP Level 4, the helmet greater than 600 hours of play time, and the pants at least 100 hours of play time. Those went pretty quickly and the claim period ended, so the only way to get them now is to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>As some critics have pointed out, <em>Breakpoint</em> doesn&#39;t have the most alluring visual aesthetic, so it seems an odd choice to kick off an NFT for visual collectibles. On the other hand, Ubisoft may have been just dipping its toe into the water with one of its less high-profile, though still popular franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>For the minimum money collected so far, however, the effort may have done more harm than good. Ubisoft reportedly alienated its own French trade union, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-16-french-trade-union-calls-ubisoft-nft-scheme-a-useless-costly-ecologically-mortifying-technology">called NFTs</a> &quot;a useless, costly, ecologically mortifying tech.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fe03c4-70b5-4330-bdf1-6524d09ef5a0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:07:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640095946</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T14:12:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tiffany Haddish is getting her own Supernatural VR workout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Popular virtual reality workout app <em>Supernatural</em> is partnering with comedian Tiffany Haddish to release a new workout series.

The e-commerce giant is selling a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire 7 Kids tablet and an Echo Kids speaker bundle" href="https://amzn.to/33MSQd8">Fire 7 Kids tablet and an Echo Kids speaker bundle</a> for just $80, which is 50 percent off their original retail prices together. You can get the 7-inch tablet in purple, pink or blue, while the Echo Dot speaker that it comes with has a panda design.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/33MSQd8" id="966562ed16264ab6a64962a5dd1101e8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Amazon Fire 7 Kids Tablet + Echo Dot Kids Bundle at Amazon - $80</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-7-kids-edition-fire-tablet-sale-142348349.html">Fire 7 Kids tablet</a> alone normally costs $100, though Amazon has been selling it for $60 since the beginning of December. As for the fourth-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-amazon-echo-dot-kids-edition-freetime-2019.html">Echo Dot for Kids</a>, its original retail price is $60, but it&#39;s been listed for $35 since November. Even taking the discounted prices into account, you&#39;ll still save $15 if you get the bundle instead of getting each item on its own.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon&#39;s bundle comes with one year of access to Amazon Kids+, along with all of its apps, games, books, audiobooks and video. You (or the kid&#39;s parents or guardian) can give the recipient access to apps like Netflix or games like <em>Minecraft</em> via the Amazon Parent Dashboard. That&#39;s also where the child&#39;s guardian can set time limits for usage, filter out explicit songs and review activity for the Echo Dot. Of course, the bundle&#39;s recipient can also ask Alexa to play kid-friendly Audible books or interactive games from the Kids+ subscription service on their panda Echo Dot speaker.</p><p>The deal is a time-limited offer and only available for 19 more hours as of this writing. After that, the price for the bundle will likely go back to $95.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
