A retro handheld that mimicked multiple classic systems, including: All the Game Boys, the Sega Game Gear, the Neo Geo Pocket and the Atari Lynx. Oh and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-duo-turbografx-pc-engine-turboduo-fpga-console-150059918.html">recently announced</a>: the TurboExpress, too. In other good news, Analogue also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-orders-reopening-173447693.html">just announced</a> that orders for the Pocket will open again on December 14th (tomorrow). The slightly less good news is that at $220, it&#39;ll cost $20 more than originally planned, but you can blame the virus for that and its impact on supply chains.</p><p>Finally, it’s here and it’s… still just as exciting. So much so that the short time I&#39;ve had with the Pocket isn&#39;t enough to give it the deep dive review it deserves. You have to remember, this thing not only plays old games from original cartridges. It does so using a party trick called field-programmable gate arrays (or FPGA). All you need to know is that FPGAs effectively mimic old consoles at the hardware level. When you plug in a game, it thinks it’s in an original Game Boy (or whichever system for the relevant adapter you might be using). Couple that with a display custom-designed to replicate vintage screens, quirks and all, and this has all the ingredients to be the most authentic retro handheld you can find. Our early testing with Game Boy (original) and Game Boy Advance games indicates this really is one of the most authentic experiences you can find.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pretty much the moment you pick this thing up you know you’re in for a treat. If the original Game Boy had been released today with a Scandinavian design, this is what it would look like. The clean lines and monochrome aesthetic tell you this is all about the game; there are no garish colors of cliche nods to the &#39;90s here. Just one dash of color on the left-hand side for the power button and that’s as flashy as things get.</p><p>The general layout broadly matches the first-gen and Game Boy color, with the screen up top and controls underneath. Though there are four thumb buttons instead of two as you’ll be able to create games for this yourself either with GB Studio or via the spare FPGA core Analogue added just for developers. There are shoulder buttons, too, as per the Game Boy advance.</p><p>Fortunately, the display is thoroughly modern and not like the squinty, if much loved, one from back in 1989. It’s also handily 10 times the resolution on both axes so it can serve up pixel-perfect renditions of your favorite original Game Boy titles. The way it reproduces original Game Boy games is quite remarkable.</p><p>Turn the Pocket on and the minimalist interface leads you straight to the good stuff: Playing games.</p><p>I won’t lie, firing up Tetris for the first time and changing the Pockets display mode to the original green-and-black game boy mode was quite the dash of nostalgia. I’ve played Game Boy games on several “modern” handhelds and none of them looked like this. Even the pixel grid of the original is here, the motion blur (if you want it), the sound. Everything felt just as it did all those years ago.</p><p>The same goes for Game Boy Advance games. If you ever owned the first model of GBA, you’ll (painfully) remember that it still didn’t have a lit screen. The Pocket does, but everything else matches, including a preset for that slight washed-out look that comes with just colors on a non-illuminated LCD. You can, of course, choose a more modern display mode if you like, but purists are going to love the attention to detail here.</p><p>The authenticity doesn’t stop at the fidelity of the games. The “link” port on the Pocket happens to be the same as the one found on the Game Boy Color and onwards. That means if you have the original hardware (or another Pocket) you can play with friends just like you would have back in the proverbial day. I <em>do</em> have the original hardware, and we’re testing those features right now which you’ll see in our full review.</p><p>In terms of compatibility, so far the only glitch we&#39;ve had is with a very unofficial Game Boy Advance multicart, everything else has worked a charm — including fund stuff like the Game Boy Camera. The same goes for Game Gear titles, which is the only other platform we can try right now.</p><p>There’s so much more to cover here we kinda can’t wait to show you it all. There’s the dock accessory for playing on a TV with real controllers, there’s the aforementioned music-making app, there’s Analogue’s own operating system which hides more than a few perks and then there are the adapters for all the other consoles.</p><p>For now, we’re excited to say that the Pocket appears to deliver on its key promises. The hardware feels fantastic and we keep going back for more Tetris even when it&#39;s way past our bedtime. You’ll just have to wait a few more days for our comprehensive review.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-first-look-handheld-gaming-as-good-as-it-ever-was-160050430.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebcd820c-f9eb-4a76-8eb7-1cc80c4579ad</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639403516</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T13:52:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8910c3b0-5c02-11ec-9ffc-1ae2dddcfdb7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8910c3b0-5c02-11ec-9ffc-1ae2dddcfdb7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket first look.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket first look]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rihanna, Migos and more are getting official metaverse avatars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Universal Music Group is hitching its wagon more firmly to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html"><ins>metaverse hype train</ins></a>.

How is the rest of the game shaping up?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At a hands-off briefing, Square Enix offered a closer look at the characters, world-building and capabilities of the bangle-wielding Frey, who fell through a magical portal from New York to the land of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-athia-forspoken-185544084.html">Athia</a>. We also got to see a lot more of the battle systems and spells you&#39;ll be able to wield, all running on an early version of the game.</p><div id="525c3a5953c2474eb4bac4032a022ed6"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tku_2N6yhgc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>This is the first title from Square Enix’s new studio, Luminous Productions. <em>Forspoken</em> runs on the studio’s proprietary graphics engine, Luminous Engine. A streamed video call on Zoom isn’t the best place to marvel at graphics, but judging from the higher-resolution trailers, there seems to be a focus on fluidity. And flinging around a lot of spells.</p><p>Beyond elemental attacks of varying scales, magical powers include the aforementioned magic parkour, where the hero can dash at speed, jump again mid-air, dodge attacks and more. Running on the studio’s proprietary Luminous Engine, the team is aiming to run the game at 2K 60 FPS and 4K 30 FPS, with ray-tracing graphical options too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d82f7cdffe1e435c92c4a465406028dc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/18a09080-5c14-11ec-bbed-db8ebfce2198" alt="Forspoken" data-uuid="57ef97a0-06f6-3ec6-897b-bb8df8b7c267"></section><p>The new studio is taking different approaches to the story, too. Instead of in-house writers, Luminous Productions tapped Allison Rymer (who wrote for the TV series <em>Shadowhunters</em>)  and Todd Stashwick as lead writers. The development team, which had last worked on the divisive <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, said they were looking to create a game with more “universal appeal”,  promising a narrative-led action-adventure RPG. However, judging by this early look, <em>Forspoken</em> may not stray too far from the video-game trope of messianic-outsider-saves-mystical-lands.</p><p>There is a focus on both the female lead, voiced and mo-capped by actor Ella Balinsk, and several female antagonists – mad sorceresses called Tantas. The world of Athia has a matriarchal society, ensuring, rightly, that the most important players are women. Still, the preview didn’t really help us get much of a bead on where the story of <em>Forspoken</em> will take Frey. The team is also promising post-launch DLC content, called In Tanta We Trust, which will function as a prequel to the main title.</p><p>We do know that encroaching darkness has trapped what’s left of humanity within the walls of a single city, Cipaul. The rest of the world is now covered in this sinister fog, “The Break”, that warps and absorbs life.</p><p>Some of the citizens of Cipaul view Frey as a demon – a threat – because she’s able to survive the Break outside of the city, not to mention the magical freerunning and elemental arsenal that comes with her cuff of magical bangles. There are RPG-style upgrades to unlock, too. Frey will be able to upgrade her cloak and nail art (!) to improve stamina and increase spell strength, which is a modern twist on magical jewels and runes.</p><p>In the tradition of <em>Destiny</em>’s Ghost, and er, <em>Ratchet and Clank</em>’s Clank, the cuff has a British accent and a sassy disposition. It will banter with Frey and respond to how she fights. It’s hard to tell from the early preview, but it seems like the cuffs (called Cuff?) will even offer up battle insights and fight-style advice. A Square Enix spokesperson said the team was “still in the process of adjusting the exact frequency, content and volume” of their interactions. That’s a good sign, because Frey seems to cuss a lot and there are diminishing returns to exclaiming “Shit!” every time a monster attacks. See: <em>Devil May Cry.</em></p><p>The preview teased stealth spells, magical land mines and using your cloak as a sort-of grappling hook. Even while moving at a high pace, <em>Forspoken</em> will slow things down when you’re aiming at crucial ledges, which seems like a thankfully forgiving touch.</p><p>I’m most interested in how <em>Forspoken</em> will actually play and how fights will feel. With battle spells, Frey can choose different effects and spells from rings, holding several in as shortcut spots for easy (repeated) use, but it’s hard to tell how intuitive this will feel.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/18a17ae0-5c14-11ec-97b8-8cd684340d6d" style="height:1350;width:2400;" alt="Forspoken" data-uuid="b3733af0-a795-3c54-9171-4159c40a0c94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix, Luminous Productions</div></figure><p>At the end of my 30-minute briefing, the developers show off Breakstorms, random supernatural events that spawn monsters and a bigger beast, a skeletal giraffe kind of thing with one eye that shoots energy beams. Frey casts multiple high-level spells, stacking effects and mixing up strategies for both crowd control and escaping the wrath of the boss monster at the center of it all. In this instance, she doesn’t quite make it, falling to the monster’s attacks, but the first thing I thought was – I want to play this myself, and best this cyclops giraffe. Hopefully, Square Enix is able to ensure these fights feel as fluid as Frey’s magical parkour dashes.</p><p></p><p><em>Forspoken launches on ​​PS5 and PC on May 24th, 2022.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-forspoken-magical-parkour-spells-rpg-140017421.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">22bb7e31-ee56-4d18-b983-c117bc5ea830</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639402405</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T13:33:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/18a4d640-5c14-11ec-bb6d-9617235881df" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/18a4d640-5c14-11ec-bb6d-9617235881df" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix, Luminous Productions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forspoken]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forspoken]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 hits new low of $570 on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s latest Mac Mini is the most cost-effective way to get an M1 machine, and now you can get the desktop for even less.

It packs a good amount of power into a compact device thanks to Apple&#39;s M1 chipset. While we haven&#39;t put the Mac Mini through its paces, we have tested out the MacBook Air M1 and the previous MacBook Pro M1 — both of which impressed us with their overall smooth performance and remarkable speed. It sports an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, plus a 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks. While the 256GB model is probably sufficient for most people, you&#39;ll future-proof the device a bit if you spring for the version with extra storage because you won&#39;t run out of space as quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With all of the improvements being internal, the latest Mac Mini looks much the same as the previous version. The silver box has a seamless appearance on most sides, save for its back edge which holds all of its connectivity options including two Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A connectors, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Since we didn&#39;t get an updated Mac Mini this fall, there&#39;s currently no telling when Apple may introduce a new version of its small desktop. That makes a sale like this one a great opportunity to upgrade your home&#39;s computer without spending too much money. If you plan on gifting the device, just keep in mind that it may arrive after Christmas depending on which model you choose.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-mac-mini-m1-hits-new-low-of-570-on-amazon-135537997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">142b65f2-1ff1-4ccf-acdf-5dac7bc7bed0</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 13:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639403398</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T13:50:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony will begin selling official PlayStation 5 covers next month]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After shutting down third-party PS5 console covers with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/platestation-panels-discontinued-202340595.html">legal threats</a>, Sony has launched its own official $55 PlayStation five colors, the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/12/13/new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-arrive-next-month-followed-by-new-ps5-console-covers/">announced</a>.

If you&#39;ve been looking at getting an 8-core model for productivity or creative chores but found the $1,500 price a tad much, there&#39;s good news. The 8GB version with 256GB of storage is now available at Amazon for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$1,400" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09326G4R1?linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=d854cf2d64b95e012d645d90b4d3e64a&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl&amp;th=1">$1,400</a>, the lowest price we&#39;ve seen yet.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DQ7UCX" id="fb96daa8433440a18bd2e28cfc967547" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple iMac M1">Buy Apple iMac M1 at Amazon - $1,400</a><p>The 2021 iMac M1 received an excellent Engadget review score for a variety of reason. With a new M1 chip also found on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">Apple&#39;s MacBooks</a>, it delivers formidable performance for activities ranging from spreadsheets to video editing to gaming. It even loads quickly, waking up almost instantly from sleep mode and getting to the desktop in around 25 seconds from a cold start. On top of that, it&#39;s 50 percent quieter than past models.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also got a fresh new design, with slimmer bezels and a more refined look. The new 24-inch, 4.5K Retina display is also excellent, thanks to the full DCI-P3 color gamut coverage and 500-nit brightness. Another nice upgrade is the new 1080p FaceTime Camera with larger image sensors and AI tricks that improve exposure, color and noise levels.&nbsp;</p><p>The drawbacks are few, but they include a lack of HDR on the display, a port selection limited to USB-C and the Magic Mouse and Keyboard that can be uncomfortable to use. Also, if you were hoping to pick up a colorful version of the iMac, only the silver model is on sale, alas. Still, it&#39;s a nice little saving for deal hunters on a model we haven&#39;t seen discounted very often.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-8-core-24-inch-imac-all-time-low-amazon-111824240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">343b65a2-d1f3-4e6e-9aeb-ad9e2eb58347</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 11:18:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639394312</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T11:18:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c60a13a0-5bff-11ec-99ff-5b2b604c36a6" width="2000" height="1254" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c60a13a0-5bff-11ec-99ff-5b2b604c36a6" width="2000" height="1254" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's colorful 8-core 24-inch iMac falls to a new all-time low at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple's colorful 8-core 24-inch iMac falls to a new all-time low at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MGM lets potential employees try out jobs in VR before signing on]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MGM Resorts is letting applicants try out casino and hotel jobs in virtual reality (VR) before signing on, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/mgm-resorts-vr-strivr-virtual-reality-labor-shortage-attrition-retention-2021-12"><em>Business Insider</em></a> has reported. It&#39;s part of a new effort to reduce employee attrition during the &quot;great resignation&quot; that has caused labor shortages in the US and elsewhere during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>The casino and resort group is using headsets from a VR company called <a href="https://www.strivr.com/blog/mgm/">Strivr</a> that specializes in virtual training for industry health and safety, customer service and more. The idea is to let employees experience typical job activities so that they know what to expect. &quot;It can be very difficult just to verbally explain the types of positions or show a video,&quot; MGM Resorts&#39; chief HR officer Laura Lee told<em> BI</em>. Using VR, by contrast, lets applicants &quot;throw a headset on and really experience the job.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>MGM plans to use the headsets at its offices and possibly career fairs, starting in January. The idea is to let potential customer service employees experience key aspects of the job, both positive and negative. For instance, the MGM Resorts VR module would include interactions with difficult guests, something that has reportedly become more common with COVID.</p><p>The negative interactions could discourage some candidates, but MGM expects that it would also allow for better hiring decisions. The use of the tech &quot;might&#39;ve resolved some turnover we experienced when people accepted positions and then realized it wasn&#39;t quite what they thought it would be,&quot; said Lee.</p><p>MGM plans to use the tech for its proposed $9.1 billion hotel, resort and casino in Osaka, Japan. It would be the first casino in the nation, so potential employees may not be familiar with typical jobs. As such, the VR option could be offered to candidates (it won&#39;t be required) to show them customer-oriented functions like hotel check-ins and gaming operations.</p><p>VR might not be the hit everyone expected in the consumer space, but it&#39;s certainly caught on with enterprises, particularly for training. MGM also uses Strivr&#39;s tech for customer-interaction training with new employees, saying it allows them to fail without consequences while learning a role. &quot;Virtual Reality gives employees the opportunity to think and correct themselves without getting stressed or worried that they did something wrong,&quot; Lee said in a <a href="https://www.strivr.com/blog/mgm/">Strivr webinar</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mgm-is-letting-potential-employees-try-out-jobs-in-vr-before-signing-on-101720483.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">866ba51d-289d-4ba9-9534-018ea3fff36d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 10:17:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639390648</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T10:17:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Job Search]]></category><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/030908e0-5bfd-11ec-bf7b-b8a00c68f8fa" width="1406" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/030908e0-5bfd-11ec-bf7b-b8a00c68f8fa" width="1406" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Strivr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MGM is letting potential employees try out jobs in VR before signing on]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MGM is letting potential employees try out jobs in VR before signing on]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's new sleeping bags could prevent eyeball 'squashing' on the ISS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Becoming an astronaut requires <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/pdf/606877main_FS-2011-11-057-JSC-astro_trng.pdf">perfect 20/20 vision</a>, but unfortunately, the effects of space can cause astronauts to return to Earth with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-18-nasa-astronaut-vision-loss-study.html">degraded eyesight</a>. Now, researchers from UT Southwestern Medical Center have developed a sleeping bag that that could prevent or reduce those problems by effectively sucking fluid out of astronauts&#39; heads.</p><p>More than half of NASA astronauts that went to the International Space Station (ISS) for more than six months have developed vision problems to varying degrees. In one case, astronaut John Philips returned from a six month stint about the ISS in 2005 with his vision reduced from 20/20 to 20/100, as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-59591301.amp"><em>BBC</em></a> reported.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For multi-year trips to Mars, for example, this could become an issue. &quot;It would be a disaster if astronauts had such severe impairments that they couldn&#39;t see what they&#39;re doing and it compromised the mission,&quot; lead researcher Dr. Benjamin Levine told the <em>BBC</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/972c0a80-5bef-11ec-bdff-83ccb7d93fe2" style="height:393;width:700;" alt="Optical Disc Edema SANS" data-uuid="0e3b4900-cf7d-35fa-866c-627ac105eff0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">UT Southwestern/NASA</div></figure><p>Fluids tend to accumulate in the head when you sleep, but on Earth, gravity pulls them back down into the body when you get up. In the low gravity of space, though, more than a half gallon of fluid collects in the head. That in turn applies pressure to the eyeball, causing flattening that can lead to vision impairment — a disorder called&nbsp;spaceflight-associated neuro-ocular syndrome, or SANS. (Dr. Levine discovered SANS by flying cancer patients aboard zero-G parabolic flights. They still had ports in their heads to receive chemotherapy, which gave researchers an access point to measure pressure within their brains.)</p><p>To combat SANS, researchers collaborated with outdoor gear manufacturer REI to develop a sleeping bag that fits around the waist, enclosing the lower body. A vacuum cleaner-like suction device is then activated that draws fluid toward the feet, preventing it from accumulating in the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Around a dozen people volunteered to test the technology, and the results were positive. Some questions need to be answered before NASA brings the technology aboard the ISS, including the optimal amount of time astronauts should spend in the sleeping bag each day. They also need to determine if every astronaut should use one, or just those at risk of developing SANS.</p><p>Still, Dr. Levine is hopeful that SANS will no longer be an issue by the time NASA is ready to go to Mars. &quot;This is perhaps one of the most mission-critical medical issues that has been discovered in the last decade for the space program,&quot; he said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-sleeping-bag-prevent-eyeball-squashing-083937316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">409f3352-7c6d-4c26-a123-1ab4ce84932a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 08:39:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639385851</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T08:58:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/320fda10-5be9-11ec-b6b2-7befd752b8a9" width="1548" height="860" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/320fda10-5be9-11ec-b6b2-7befd752b8a9" width="1548" height="860" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UT Southwestern]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA's new sleeping bags could prevent eyeball 'squashing' on the ISS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA's new sleeping bags could prevent eyeball 'squashing' on the ISS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag drops to $25 for Amazon Prime members at Woot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s now that much more affordable to scoop up an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a> and track your keys or bag from your iPhone.

On day one of the IEDM conference in San Francisco, the two companies unveiled a new design for stacking transistors vertically on a chip. With current processors and SoCs, transistors lie flat on the surface of the silicon, and then electric current flows from side-to-side. By contrast, Vertical Transport Field Effect Transistors (VTFET) sit perpendicular to one another and current flows vertically.</p><p>According to IBM and Samsung, this design has two advantages. First, it will allow them to bypass many performance limitations to extend Moore’s Law beyond IBM&#39;s current nanosheet technology. More importantly, the design leads to less wasted energy thanks to greater current flow. They estimate VTFET will lead to processors that are either twice as fast or use 85 percent less power than chips designed with FinFET transistors. IBM and Samsung claim the process may one day allow for phones that go a full week on a single charge. They say it could also make certain energy-intensive tasks, including cryptomining, more power-efficient and therefore less impactful on the environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to commercialize the design. They’re not the only companies attempting to push beyond the 1-nanometer barrier. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">In July</a>, Intel said it aims to finalize the design for angstrom-scale chips by 2024. The company plans to accomplish the feat using its new “Intel 20A” node and RibbonFET transistors.</p><p><strong>Update 12/12 12:20PM ET:</strong> IBM has clarified that VTFET will help it expand beyond its existing nanosheet technology, not necessarily to chips denser than 1nm.

Reddit user KitchenPicture5849 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/">discovered</a> that having Teams installed, but not signed in, would prevent emergency calls from going through. The phone would say a call was active and ring once, but never properly initiate the connection — call logs would show nothing.</p><p>Rahman and friend Kuba Wojciechowski pinpointed the cause. While all Android calling apps will try to create a PhoneAccount class instance in the operating system, Teams was creating instances every time a user started the app &quot;cold&quot; — that increased the chances of a sorting problem that stopped calls from going through.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google talked to the Reddit user and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/">revealed</a> that both the company and Microsoft were planning fixes. In addition to the Microsoft patch, Google is delivering an Android platform update on January 4th that should address its side of the problem. You can delete and reinstall Teams to clear any excess PhoneAccount instances, and staying logged in should prevent any mishaps.</p><p>Google said this only affected a &quot;small number of devices.&quot; The issue, however, was the severity. This could have blocked someone from making a life-saving call through no fault of their own.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-911-call-android-bug-fix-201139753.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9366d23a-1369-48ff-9037-35831b046d97</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 20:11:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639253503</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T20:11:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[releon8211 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emergency and urgency, dialing 911 on smartphone screen.

Wheeler and Christina D. Rosan. Reprinted with permission from University of California Press.</p><hr><p>While this book is about reimagining sustainable cities, we pause here to connect sustainable cities with the larger national and international context in terms of spatial inequality. We live in a world that is deeply interconnected. If we want sustainable cities, we need to work on reducing spatial disparities between cities and rural areas, and between different regions worldwide. Linkages between communities need to be recognized, and resources shared and equalized. Situations must be ended in which some regions exploit others by giving them the unwanted by-products of production, such as pollution, waste, and labor exploitation, while simultaneously moving resources and profits from poor regions to rich ones.</p><p>In and around the towns of eastern Kentucky, where Stephen Wheeler’s ancestral family is from, people of English and Scottish descent lived for many generations as self-sufficient farming families. That way of life changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Better roads, electricity, and telecommunications connected Appalachia with the rest of the world. Urban job opportunities lured away the young. Farming families became part of the cash economy and acquired new desires for processed foods, appliances, motor vehicles, and personal accessories. But hill farms didn’t generate enough cash to buy such things, especially with rising federal subsidies for agribusiness in other parts of the country. So the people of eastern Kentucky became designated as poor and came to see themselves that way.</p><p>Environmental problems grew as well. Giant bulldozers scraped away hilltops and extracted coal, adding this region to the long list of others worldwide suffering from the “resource curse.” Runoff from coal mining poisoned wells and polluted waterways. Coal jobs left as quickly as they had come, leaving many even poorer.</p><p>A new, more globalized retail economy brought first Kmart and then Walmart, putting family-owned stores out of business. Fast-food outlets proliferated. But the new service economy jobs didn’t pay much. To make better money some people began growing marijuana in hard-to-reach locations in the hills. Drug use, alcoholism, and obesity spread. Fundamentalist religion gained adherents and combined with Fox News (starting in the 1990s) to promote reactionary political values. A region that had been Democratic until the late twentieth century now helped elect US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell in turn played one of the largest roles in thwarting progressive legislation from Barack Obama’s administration, supporting Donald Trump’s presidency and fueling the rise of populism in the US.</p><p>If this tale of decline were one isolated example, it might not matter much. But spatial inequality persists and spreads worldwide. Some left-behind communities are rural. Others are urban. Entire countries are stuck in poverty due to the legacy of military or economic colonization. Spatial inequality is a core challenge to the development of more sustainable cities. Every community needs to be able to thrive, not just certain favored ones within a highly unequal global system. Instead of engaging in a zero-sum approach to development, with winners and losers, communities need to support one another so that all improve their quality of life and sustainability.</p><p>The so-called winners of today’s global economic competition have their own problems. At the other end of the spectrum from Appalachia is Silicon Valley. This forty-mile corridor in the San Francisco Bay Area is an economic dynamo envied the world over. Covered by orchards and agricultural fields in the 1950s, this beautiful area was known as “Valley of Heart’s Desire.” Now no orchards remain, and the region is a congested sprawl of poorly connected office parks, subdivisions, malls, and commercial strips. Incomes are high, but the price of a home is nearly five times that in the US as a whole. Many residents cannot afford housing near their jobs and so endure lengthy commutes or are housing insecure. Social inequality, traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions expanded greatly during the past fifty years, reducing the quality of life in the region and contributing to global warming.</p><p>The Silicon Valley ethic of “move fast and break things” has created dynamic companies, unprecedented technology, and great wealth for a few. But the new gig economy pioneered there often operates at the expense of workers and the environment. It often produces an enormous concentration of wealth that comes from the exploitation of others. One study found that one-fifth of San Francisco Uber and Lyft drivers earned virtually nothing when their full expenses, including things such as health insurance, were accounted for. The tech industry has also been heavily criticized for sexual harassment during the MeToo movement and racism during the Black Lives Matter movement. The combination of individualism, predatory capitalism, toxic masculinity, and lack of concern for the common good that Silicon Valley represents works strongly against a sustainable and equitable future.</p><p>Similar problems of unequal development exist in other successful urban areas worldwide, including Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Bangalore, Singapore, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Tel Aviv. Though among the world’s economic success stories, on many dimensions of sustainability they are failures. The growing core-periphery disparities that produce left-behind communities and “sacrifice zones” on the one hand and wealthy but unsustainable and highly unequal job centers on the other are at the heart of recent global development patterns.</p><p>Let us imagine instead a world where we are not content with the concentration of wealth and opportunity in a small number of global cities; where all communities have affordable housing and provide a decent quality of life; where cities meet the needs of people locally and regionally but do not drain wealth from other parts of the world; where no areas are left behind in the transition to a green economy, their populations increasingly alienated, despairing, and vulnerable to unscrupulous politicians and warlords; and where social dimensions of sustainability are well served everywhere.</p><h2>Sources of the Problem</h2><p>Today’s spatial inequity problems have long historical roots, illuminated by literature in fields such as economic geography, sociology, and environmental history. One starting point is physical geography. Some parts of the world have more fertile soils than others, more abundant mineral resources, more useful plant, animal, and fish species, and/or more benign topography and climate. Other places have been strategically well located to serve as trading centers and market towns or have been easy to defend against attack. Such communities have been able to accumulate modest amounts of wealth and power. The “chessboard” of geographical wealth is constantly shifting and with global warming is likely to shift in even greater ways in the future.</p><p>However, in other cases spatial inequities have resulted from military, religious, cultural, political, and/or economic systems that further centralize power and wealth. Typically these have drained resources from the periphery to the core of empires. Many parts of the world still suffer the legacy of colonization. Local traditions and cultures were disrupted, peoples were exploited, racism was institutionalized, ecosystems were harmed, and corrupt, colonizer-friendly governments were installed following independence. The damage has been so profound and long-lasting in many places that reparations may be appropriate. The need for climate justice may likewise call for reparations and repayments.</p><p>Twentieth-century economic development philosophies exacerbated spatial inequality on the assumption that economic globalization was to everyone’s long-term benefit. Various versions of “growth pole” theory, originating in the 1950s, sought to focus business development in particular geographical locales within countries on the assumption that this would leverage economic development in other parts. Such wider-scale progress was rare; growth poles instead often channeled resources to local elites, created isolated business enclaves, and harmed the environment.</p><p>The municipal economic development practice of chasing branches of multinational corporations has likewise undermined prospects for a more stable long-term economic base in cities worldwide. This “race to the bottom” competition leads suburbs to compete to host the newest shopping mall, central cities to compete for corporate headquarters, and states or countries to lower their environmental and labor standards to attract multinational corporations. However, the resulting businesses often don’t provide the expected number of jobs, pay the decent wages promised, or stay more than a few years. As Margaret Dewar has pointed out in her well-titled article “Why State and Local Economic Development Programs Cause So Little Economic Development,” politicians have an incentive in the short term to appear to be generating jobs by attracting well-known companies but little incentive to take into account long-term economic or environmental sustainabilIty. A recent example of the extreme lengths that municipalities will go to in order to attract development can be seen in the global competition for the second Amazon headquarters.</p><p>The Bretton Woods framework of post–World War II development assistance only deepened global spatial disparities, creating what economist Andres Gunder Frank termed “the development of underdevelopment.” Agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned funds to developing countries for megaprojects that created wealth for elites but left others poor and displaced, while countries accumulated enormous debt to lenders in the Global North. National governments focused on what sustainability-oriented NGOs refer to as “extreme infrastructure.” These dams, power plants, industrial zones, and large-scale agricultural projects sought to jump-start an export-oriented form of economic development that was often environmentally harmful and funneled capital created by Third World labor and resources into First World bank accounts.</p><p>Yet another source of disparities has been the structural adjustment policies that neoliberal governments in wealthy nations insisted upon as a condition for international assistance during the past forty years. These require developing countries to take actions such as cutting social programs, privatizing public assets such as utilities and railroads, reducing barriers to foreign investment, and lowering taxes on the wealthy. The effect has been to make life harder for the poor while enriching elites and international corporations. It is increasingly clear that structural adjustment policies need to be discontinued and policies that promote spatial equity put in their place.</p><p>Finally, the offshoring of manufacturing from wealthy nations to low-cost and less regulated parts of the globe during the past half century has had complex effects on spatial disparities. It has impoverished the US Rust Belt as well as the British Midlands, leading to the growth of right-wing populism in both places. Meanwhile, it has helped fuel the rise of megacities and megaregions in the developing world, leading to massive internal migration and expanding economic disparities between those urban areas and the countryside. Undoubtedly, these global economic shifts have improved quality of life for many. But they have harmed others, disrupted societies, contributed to the climate crisis, and widened the gulf between rich and poor communities (figure 7).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1f1fc860-56c7-11ec-bffd-16e17bfa19fa" alt="Figure 7" data-uuid="b580afab-a76e-34ee-aff7-402996e8b255"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">UC Press</div></figure><p>Although spatial disparities are still expanding in many places, there is hope for the rebirth of left-behind cities and regions. Manchester, UK, the first industrial powerhouse in Europe, lost much of its manufacturing in the middle of the twentieth century but has since rebuilt itself by focusing on culture, education, physical regeneration, and its geographical role as a transportation center. The US steel capital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after losing 350,000 industrial jobs in the 1980s, reinvented itself as a center of renewable energy, health care, and education. Even the long-declining hulk of Detroit, one of the most hollowed-out American cities, is showing signs of a turnaround. Examples such as these indicate the possibility for left-behind places to rebound. But all of these cities had assets to start with, including a strong identity and an active elite that led revitalization efforts. Other communities and regions don’t have such advantages. And the pervasive problems associated with spatial inequality affect wealthy as well as declining places, necessitating holistic and imaginative solutions at higher levels of governance.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-reimagining-sustainable-cities-christina-rosan-stephen-wheeler-uc-press-163019173.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253db024-1dd1-4cbc-a6fd-ff57dd237c7b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638829375</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T22:23:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/df350100-56cd-11ec-a97f-4e512f1fee0d" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff225fd0-56cd-11ec-87ff-1b44c22b3958" width="3000" height="1897" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Tama via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BOONEVILLE, KY - APRIL 20:  A man walks beneath an American flag at the Owsley County Saddle Club trail ride on April 20, 2012 in Booneville, Kentucky. The trail ride attracts riders from outside the county who contribute much needed revenue. Daniel Boone once camped in the Appalachian mountain hamlet of Owsley County which remains mostly populated by descendants of settlers to this day. The 2010 U.S. Census listed Owsley County as having the lowest median household income in the country outside of Puerto Rico, with 41.5% of residents living below the poverty line.  Familial and community bonds run deep, with a populace that shares a collective historical and cultural legacy uncommon in most parts of the country. However, the community of around 5,000 struggles with a lack of jobs due to the decline in coal, tobacco and lumber industries along with health issues including drug addiction without effective treatment.

As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, apps and services keep a record of all the events that happen while they&#39;re running, giving them a way to analyze how their program is performing and to figure out what went wrong in case of errors. Log4j happens to be a popular and widely used logging library, and even popular cloud services like Steam and iCloud, as well as apps like Amazon, Twitter and <em>Minecraft</em> are reportedly vulnerable to attacks exploiting Log4Shell.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/the-critical-log4shell-zero-day-affects-a-whos-who-of-big-cloud-services/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, it first came to light after <em>Minecraft</em> websites started reporting about a vulnerability allowing hackers to execute malicious code in the game. It became clear soon after, though, that the problem doesn&#39;t affect <em>Minecraft</em> only. Security researcher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-26-wannacry-hero-sentenced-to-supervised-release.html">Marcus Hutchins</a>, who helped stop the spread of the WannaCry malware, <a href="https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog/status/1469289471463944198">called</a> the vulnerability &quot;extremely bad&quot; since millions of applications use Log4j for logging.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bad actors could use it to remotely execute codes on servers, directing them to download and run malware that would compromise companies&#39; and people&#39;s data. Worse, it&#39;s pretty easy to exploit and could be triggered simply by posting messages. Hutchins said that in the case of <em>Minecraft</em>, attackers were able to execute code remotely by posting a message on the chatbox. In a <a href="https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/">blog post</a>, app security company LunaSec said triggering the vulnerability in Apple&#39;s servers is as easy as changing an iPhone&#39;s name.&nbsp;</p><p>Log4j has already <a href="https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html">issued</a> a fix for the vulnerability, and affected services like <em>Minecraft</em> and Cloudflare have already rolled out patches to protect users. Those running their own networks with Log4j may also want to patch their systems at the soonest possible opportunity if they can.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/log4shell-vulnerability-log4j-155543990.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8178e61a-199c-43cd-81a9-a79b47bc2e07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 15:55:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639236848</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T15:34:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/401a4460-5a8b-11ec-b619-8ac4a694b252" width="5000" height="2813" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/401a4460-5a8b-11ec-b619-8ac4a694b252" width="5000" height="2813" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gorodenkoff via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Display Showing Stages of Hacking in Progress: Exploiting Vulnerability, Executing and Granted Access.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Display Showing Stages of Hacking in Progress: Exploiting Vulnerability, Executing and Granted Access.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A scene from the 'Sex and the City' revival created a PR emergency for Peloton]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains a major spoiler for the first season of &#39;And Just Like That</em>.&#39;</p><p>Peloton is grappling with another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-recall-cpsc-safety-us-canada-154309695.html">media crisis</a> in 2021, although this one is decidedly... stranger. As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828003/peloton-bike-satc-and-just-like-that">reports</a>, Peloton has raced to defend its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-living-with-peloton-bike.html">signature Bike</a> after a scene in the first episode of HBO Max&#39;s <em>Sex and the City</em> revival, <em>And Just Like That</em>, featured the cycling hardware in a less-than-flattering way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scene depicted Carrie&#39;s husband Mr. Big, played by Chris Noth, dying of a heart attack soon after he finished a 45-minute Peloton class on the company&#39;s Bike (with real instructor Jess King in a fictional role, we&#39;d add). Peloton is worried viewers might think the Bike was responsible, and not just because the show might hurt sales — the company&#39;s stock price plunged between December 9th and December 10th, and it didn&#39;t get much better by the weekend.</p><p>In a statement, Peloton health and wellness advisor Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum argued that Mr. Big&#39;s death likely occurred despite the Bike, not because of it. Big lived an &quot;extravagant lifestyle&quot; that included drinking, smoking and a steak-filled diet, and he&#39;d even had a cardiac incident in <em>SATC</em>&#39;s sixth season. If anything, Dr. Steinbaum suggested, Big&#39;s riding might have &quot;helped delay&quot; his heart attack.</p><p>Peloton also said it was caught off-guard. Spokesperson Denise Kelly <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/peloton-big-just-like-that-hbo">told</a><em>BuzzFeed News</em> the company was aware an HBO-purchased Bike would be in the episode and that King would portray an instructor, but &quot;confidentiality reasons&quot; prevented it from learning about the tragic plot point until the <em>And Just Like That</em> premiere.</p><p>This likely won&#39;t significantly dent Peloton&#39;s sales figures. Still, this probably isn&#39;t the publicity the firm wanted as it grapples with a treadmill recall and stiffer competition from rivals like Bowflex, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echelon-prime-bike-shutdown-093532139.html">Echelon</a> and NordicTrack. Peloton may have to hope <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-price-cut-230347867.html">price cuts</a>, a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-guide-machine-learning-strength-training-152637209.html">strength training camera</a> and a loyal following will help it overcome any hesitancy from <em>Sex and the City</em> fans.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sex-and-the-city-peloton-bike-scene-152028623.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b237a7b-d006-4bb1-908e-414f6e24689a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 15:20:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639239577</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T16:19:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7e185d50-5a8c-11ec-97de-17cd16d432dd" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7e185d50-5a8c-11ec-97de-17cd16d432dd" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Scott Heins via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 04: A Peloton stationary bike sits on display at one of the fitness company's studios on December 4, 2019 in New York City.
