The Action 2 features a 155-degree field of view lens and 12-megapixel sensor that can capture 4K footage at up to 120 frames per second, and 240 frames per second slow-motion video at 1080p. In 2021, that’s not impressive for an action camera when you consider GoPro’s latest top-end model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">Hero 10 Black</a>, can do 5.3K at 60 frames per second and 240 frames per second at 2.7K. So what makes Action 2 into something interesting? It’s all about the form factor.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/35a32a10-3736-11ec-bed7-f78069e9e3e3" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="DJI Action 2" data-uuid="04a8ba74-3340-36a3-861d-5a4fb9190ab6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>DJI’s latest device weighs just under two ounces and includes a magnetic mounting system you can use to expand the functionality of the camera. We’ve seen companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-insta360-one-r-leica-modular-action-cam.html">Insta360</a> pull off similar designs, but DJI’s execution looks particularly handy. Want to add a front-facing display to make the Action 2 into a vlogging camera? You can with a touchscreen module that adds a secondary OLED display and three additional microphones to the camera, as well as allows you to record up to 160 minutes of footage without stopping. A separate battery module extends the Action 2’s battery life from 70 minutes to three hours and adds an extra microSD slot. Other accessories allow you to mount the camera to a floating handle, a 3-in-1 extension rod and a lanyard, among other things.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other nifty features include a dedicated sensor that can help the camera produce accurate color tones in challenging lighting conditions and underwater. A feature called SnapShot allows you to turn on the device and start recording right away by holding down the power button. It also comes with all of DJI’s usual camera features, including the ability to double as a web camera and capture time-lapses.</p><p>The Action 2 is available to buy today from <a href="https://store.dji.com/ca/product/dji-action-2?from=homepage&amp;site=brandsite&amp;vid=107601">DJI’s website</a>. The company isn’t selling the camera on its own. Instead, you can either buy it as part of either a $399 or $519 bundle. The former comes with the aforementioned battery module while the latter includes the touchscreen accessory. Both bundles also come with a variety of mounts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dji-action-2-announcement-152328716.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1277af1f-55bc-49c6-ac9e-4484d686bb42</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:23:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635348211</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T15:23:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f47765f0-3736-11ec-abfc-40700a9fdd36" width="1380" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f47765f0-3736-11ec-abfc-40700a9fdd36" width="1380" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DJI]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJI Action 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI Action 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Urbanista's solar-powered headphones tease a charger-free future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>81 percent. That’s the current battery level on the pair of Urbanista’s Los Angeles headphones sitting on my desk. When I took them out of the box about a week ago, the battery level was 75 percent. Number of charges? Zero. Hours of use? Around 10. In short, with some fairly typical listening and precisely no interaction with a charging cable, the headphones have more battery life than when I received them. Impressive, though not without some caveats.</p><p>First, let’s back up a little bit. If you missed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-los-angeles-anc-headphones-solar-cells-080019327.html">the announcement</a>, the Los Angeles’ main selling point was that they came with “Powerfoyle” solar charging cells in the headband for $200. The promise was simple: even indoors, these headphones will slowly charge when not in use. Go outside? They might even maintain their level while playing music; if it’s a particularly sunny day they could even gain battery life while you listen, even with ANC on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headphones themselves have a classic Scandinavian understated look. Acoustically, they don’t offer too many surprises. That’s to say, expect a <em>slightly </em>bottom-heavy EQ experience, but overall they deliver robust clear audio that won’t tire your ears. They are Bluetooth only, though, so no wired option here. More on that in a bit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bfcaa960-3656-11ec-afff-7df78af80f13" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles headphones" data-uuid="3e060e74-5a3b-3994-804f-76e4e22b404d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, the real interest is that claim of a “nonstop audio experience.” As my intro suggests, the company’s claims are true. Or should I say, <em>can</em> be true? The headphones definitely charge themselves, even indoors, but it’s not time to throw away the (included) USB cable just yet.</p><p>If you plan on using these mostly indoors, then you will almost certainly be charging them. Even about as much as you might any other pair. That’s because while the claim about indoor charging is true, it’s barely a trickle and only really under direct light. If you place them near a window between uses you can expect a little more juice, but it’s still more of a modest top-off than a flow of free energy.</p><p>This I can say with relative confidence thanks to the companion app which kindly shows you power coming in versus power being used with a fancy little circular chart. When the photons are abundant, the chart turns a pale green and a reassuring “up” arrow lets you know the headphones are gaining power. Enter the shadows, however, and things turn red to let you know you’re draining the battery. You can even see the amount of energy coming in or being used at any one time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4536b6e0-3650-11ec-afd8-3025bc6cb94d" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones." data-uuid="94113c03-9705-31a3-b195-e043dca48d89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With this info we can start to get an idea of how effectively the solar charging works. For example, just by turning the headphones on they will use about 2.6mA to maintain a connection to a phone. Play music, and this goes up to around 9mA. Add on either ANC or Ambient mode and this can creep up to around 13-15mA. Those are our numbers to “beat.”</p><p>In my testing, when laid flat on a table in a room without direct sunlight or any lights on during the day, they won’t charge at all. If I placed them <em>directly </em>under a lamp or bulb you might get between 0.2 and 1mA of charge. Place them near a window during the day and this can climb to about 3mA. Open that window and it’ll increase to maybe 4mA (indirect sunlight). So far, you’re only really slowing down their battery use by a tiny amount.</p><p>As I already hinted at, things get a lot more interesting once you head outside. Walking in the shade in the street you can expect about 3-5mA of input. Again, you’re still in net loss. Head out directly into the sun, however, and everything springs to life. I was frequently able to achieve 24mA of “gain” while listening to music with ANC (for around 8-10mA of drain).</p><p>The short version is… that the Urbanistas will charge when there’s ambient light. A bit. But take them outside (and with good sunshine) and they will even charge while in use. All this to say that, if I used these like I do any other wireless headphones, I would expect the solar charging to maybe add a few hours to their battery life. If I only used them outdoors, they would live forever.</p><p>This is all good news though. What Urbanista has done here is set a benchmark. JBL <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-jbl-reflect-eternal-solar-powered-headphones.html">tried something similar</a>, but <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jbl-reflect-eternal-self-charging-headphones/#/">that project</a> was tabled due to COVID travel restrictions making them unviable. Urbanista is actually shipping its version and it can only get better from here.</p><p>Perhaps the most understated achievement here is that the headphones don’t <em>look</em> like they have a solar panel attached. At least if you opt for the black pair. The cells in the head strap more or less blend into the design of the Los Angeles, just with the Powerfoyle logo on them (also in black so it’s fairly subtle). The headphones are also available in “sand gold” which is more of a cream/mushroom color. On those, the solar strip is painfully obvious but done in such a way it could be passed off as a style choice.</p><p>There are some other minor notes to consider. Most notably, for me, the volume. Urbanista says the pair I received for review are set at about 2dB below what the retail model will offer. But using them with an iPhone I have to almost always have them on full volume if I want to be immersed in a song. I found myself frequently mashing the volume button in vain when a banger came on and I wanted to get truly lost in sound but there was never anywhere left to go. I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR8fG8ccqAA&amp;t=135s">a lot of bangers</a>.</p><p>For people that don’t assault their ears, the volume is probably fine. It’s not hugely lower than, say, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-20-aiaiai-tma-2-hd-modular-headphones-hands-on.html">AiAiAi TMA-2s</a> I use. Connect things to a computer and, well, you can go a bit louder, so some of this, the company suggests, is down to your device’s chipset and regional limitations.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3da3edc0-365b-11ec-975d-7b475a19e3c5" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles headphones." data-uuid="77aa5e34-a8d2-3047-9c36-373d33f060af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If there was a second bugbear, it’d be the buttons. The Los Angeles has three buttons on the right side for volume/play/pause and skipping tracks and power. Then there’s a lone button on the other side for switching between ANC, Ambient mode and “default” mode or activating your phone’s assistant. The problem is, the buttons on the right side — i.e. the ones you interact with most — are tiny and very close together. This means that swift volume changes are difficult. Instead, you have to sort of fondle around to “count” the buttons with your finger to find the first or third one.</p><p>I do also wish there was the option to use them with a 3.5mm cable. Not only does that give you an option for whenever the battery does run out (or you’re in an Airplane mode situation) it would ameliorate some of my volume woes for when I really do need to feel a drop right to the core of my amygdala. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html">DACs are wonderful things</a>.)</p><p>As for other small positives, the app is a nice touch and opens up the door for possible firmware updates or new features. It was a little flakey in connecting sometimes. Or rather, once it had been connected and then left idle, I’d sometimes have to restart it, but for the amount of time you need it it’s not a major pain to swipe it away and open it again.</p><p>There’s also auto-pause when you take the headphones off. This is a subtle but welcome addition that gives things a slightly more premium feel.</p><p>All in all, the Los Angeles’ features and pricepoint come together to make a pleasing experience. The sound is very capable without being too aggressive in the lower frequencies. The battery life is obviously a selling point if you frequently find yourself without gas while on the go. And the small touches like Ambient mode/ANC, auto pause and so on just round them out to be a little more comprehensive than other options in this price range. If they were a smidge louder and had a 3.5mm port then these would be a solid pick for me, but even without those features, it’s hard not to admire what Urbanista has done here for $200.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urbanistas-solar-power-los-angeles-headphones-review-152013319.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb73c2d8-828b-4093-94ae-347c3e3add57</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:20:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635344849</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:27:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cfa472a0-364f-11ec-bf1f-e49ca3b58671" width="3840" height="2225" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cfa472a0-364f-11ec-bf1f-e49ca3b58671" width="3840" height="2225" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft details plans to slash water use at its data centers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the UN&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cop26/"><ins>COP26</ins></a> climate change conference, which starts on Sunday, Microsoft has revealed more details about its plans to make its data centers greener. Among those is a goal of reducing the amount of water its data centers use by 95 percent by 2024 — around 5.7 billion liters each year.</p><p>Data centers often use water to keep servers cool. Microsoft has researched server performance at higher temperatures and found that it&#39;s able to &quot;create higher set points for a variety of different climates for when water-based, evaporative cooling is necessary to preserve server performance and reliability,&quot; as Noelle Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s corporate vice president of cloud ops and innovation <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/27/supporting-our-customers-on-the-path-to-net-zero-the-microsoft-cloud-and-decarbonization/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says this project, which it expects to be fully implemented by 2024, could completely eliminate the need to use water for cooling in locations such as Amsterdam, Dublin, Virginia and Chicago. It may reduce water use in desert data center locations (like Arizona) by up to 60 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft continuing its research into liquid immersion cooling to reduce its dependency on water. The company says that, this year, it became the first cloud services provider to run &quot;two-phase liquid immersion cooling in a production environment.&quot; It&#39;s been looking into overclocking as well and found liquid cooling can increase performance of some chipsets by 20 percent.</p><p>&quot;Because of the efficiencies in both power and cooling that liquid cooling affords us, it unlocks new potential for datacenter rack design,&quot; Walsh wrote. &quot;In short, liquid cooling paves the way for more densely packed servers in smaller spaces, meaning increased capacity per square foot in a datacenter — or the ability to create smaller datacenters in more strategic locations in the future. This adds to the benefits of waterless cooling design.&quot;</p><p>Last September, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-water-positive-2030-164019192.html"><ins>announced plans</ins></a> to become &quot;water positive&quot; (i.e. to replenish more water than it uses) by 2030, and these data center efforts will be a key part of that goal. It also aims to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-carbon-negative-2030-steps-093047774.html"><ins>carbon negative</ins></a> by the end of the decade by removing more carbon than it emits. By 2050, the company plans to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it has generated since it was founded in 1975.</p><p>In addition, Microsoft says it&#39;s designing data centers with local ecosystems in mind &quot;to renew and revitalize the surrounding area so that we can restore and create a pathway to provide regenerative value for the local community and environment.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s attempting to use more environmentally friendly processes in designing and building data centers to reduce its carbon footprint. The aim is to use building materials that reduce &quot;embodied carbon,&quot; or emissions linked to materials and construction during a building&#39;s life cycle. Concrete and steel are said to be major contributors of such emissions.

The well-known Twitch personality is co-founding <a href="https://www.rts.gg/">RTS</a>, a talent management and brand consulting company that plans to fix &quot;what is broken&quot; for both game streamers and esports.

There are plenty of talented streamers who are &quot;spinning their wheels on basic stuff&quot; and forging partnerships that don&#39;t work for either side, she said.

That’s according to Streamlabs, which published its <a href="https://medium.com/@ethan.may/8b6ceb6a9c32">Q3 2021 Live Streaming Industry Report</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>The company says viewers watched 1.29 billion hours of content on Facebook Gaming between August and September, representing a 9.2 percent increase from the previous quarter. By contrast, the amount of content people watched on YouTube Gaming went from 1.294 billion hours in Q2 2021 to 1.13 billion hours in the most recent three-month period. In terms of viewership, Google’s platform has seen a steady decline since it hit a peak at the end of last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube’s struggles are surprising considering the company recently spent big to secure talent like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html"><ins>DrLupo</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html"><ins>TimTheTatman</ins></a>. Steamlabs attributes the milestone to Facebook Gaming’s international popularity, in addition to the recent rollout of features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gaming-co-streaming-announcement-170034516.html"><ins>co-streaming</ins></a>. Whether Facebook can continue to top YouTube is hard to say. Over the same timeframe, the platform saw a decline in both total hours streamed and unique channels. Those stand at 17.1 million and 440,000 currently, representing declines of 17.8 percent and 48 percent from the previous quarter. For what it’s worth, Steamlabs predicts the company is on the right path.</p><p>As for Twitch, it ran into its own set of problems. People watched 5.79 billion hours of content last quarter. Obviously, that’s more than Facebook and YouTube combined, but it’s also a 11 percent decrease from the viewership numbers it saw in Q2 2021. What’s more, the above number represents a year-over-year decline of 22 percent. At the same time, Twitch saw, for the first time ever, a year-over-year decline in unique channels, with that number decreasing from 10.6 million in Q3 2020 to 10.4 million in Q3 2021.   Still, with a 70 percent share of the market in terms of hours watched, Twitch is the dominant platform in the space, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-q3-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-150022643.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">993cf5c9-bb9f-4957-9c83-93e149e967d4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635269499</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T17:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fba23c30-3680-11ec-8db7-100b3d9358aa" width="4893" height="3262" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fba23c30-3680-11ec-8db7-100b3d9358aa" width="4893" height="3262" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A display for Facebook Gaming is shown during opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.

But after <em>Toy Story 4</em> put something of a boy on Woody&#39;s story, the focus is now shifting to Buzz Lightyear. The first trailer for <em>Lightyear</em> just arrived, and it sure paints a different picture than what we&#39;re used to in the Toy Story universe. For one, the titular character isn&#39;t a toy, but a real flesh-and-blood human who appears to be the inspiration for the Buzz Lightyear figure we know so well.&nbsp;</p><div id="15e92ebcc18b40118fd12578544fd716"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BwPL0Md_QFQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The trailer definitely gives off origin story vibes, as it looks like Buzz makes the journey from pilot to intergalactic explorer in his signature spacesuit.

If it wasn’t for the matte finish, it would be almost identical to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-4k-camera-pro-best-phone-in-years-150049871.html">last year’s Xperia 1 II</a>. Sony has stuck to its unusual elongated smartphone form factor while upgrading the screen itself, as well as the cameras.</p><p>Yet again, this phone is pitched at a particular kind of smartphone shopper. That’s no bad thing, especially in a time where most smartphones — if they don’t fold — lack anything particularly unique. At $1,300, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Xperia 1 III" href="https://fave.co/3vNvI8i">Xperia 1 III</a> is also an expensive phone. That’s several hundred dollars more than an iPhone 13 Pro Max and creeping closer to prices typically held for Samsung’s flagship foldables. (Edit: Just as I wrapped up this review, Sony unveiled a new flagship smartphone, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-announcement-031222484.html">the Xperia Pro-1</a> with a bigger imaging sensor, several attachments and a $1,800 price tag.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re tempted by the potential of unrivaled smartphone camera control — or just love the aesthetic of Sony’s hardware— there’s a lot to like here.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Hardware</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090aaaa0-35a6-11ec-81ff-4c08f7227981" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review" data-uuid="fad4ae16-dcf1-3552-951e-e052a264ce7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>I’m not sure whether it’s the similarities with Sony’s camera series or simply how sleek and understated the Mk.III is, but I love how this phone looks. A black oblong is far from exotic, but it’s definitely attractive. And that’s despite the unusual screen ratio (21:9), which makes the device more elongated than pretty much all other smartphones. In addition, a new almost-matte finish adds to the premium feel, something the Xperia 1 III demands at this price.</p><p>The Mk.III lays claim to being the world’s first 4K phone with a 120Hz refresh rate. I’m splitting hairs here, but it’s 1644 x 3840 — so it’s not quite 4K like your TV would show, which would be 2160 x 3840. Predictably, everything on the screen looked incredibly crisp, and my interactions with the phone were also buttery smooth.</p><p>The 6.5-inch OLED display continues to show Sony’s obsession with displays, and given the specs, you’d expect it to look as good, if not better, than Samsung and Apple’s top devices. If you decide to switch the high refresh rate on, the Xperia won’t dynamically change refresh rates to maximize battery life. There are a lot of times when you’re simply looking at the screen that you don’t need 120Hz refresh rates.</p><p>Whether it’s Samsung’s Galaxy S 21 and its dynamic refresh rates, or the iPhone 13 Pro’s ProMotion, both of those phones flit between refresh rates as needed, reducing the toll on the battery. Unfortunately, once set, the Xperia 1 III’s screen stays at 120Hz.</p><p>The phone houses front-facing stereo speakers, which sound good. That’s still a rarity for smartphones. As you might expect from Sony, there’s support for nearly all the cutting-edge audio formats, including its own 360 Reality Audio, Hi-Resolution audio, and Dolby Atmos.</p><p>You’ll have to figure out which apps and services offer these upgraded audio experiences, as it’s still a labyrinth of discovering out exactly how to play the highest-quality music files. On that subject, Sony is clinging onto the 3.5mm audio jack for one more year.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090aaaa5-35a6-11ec-9ff0-e38856172a29" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review" data-uuid="276ca4e7-dfaa-312c-a932-adafbf8820a6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s a fingerprint sensor built into the phone’s power button on the right edge of the phone, a volume rocker, a two-stage camera shutter button and then yet another button, just because Sony could. It summons the Google Assistant but sadly can’t be assigned to other (more useful functions). In the early stages of using the phone, I’d often press the wrong one, power up the screen instead of launching the camera. Sometimes, I’d do the reverse.</p><p>Four buttons on one side is too many and while I eventually got used to it, a dedicated voice assistant button seems entirely redundant.</p><p>I might love how the Mk. III looks, but that tall screen will be a struggle for some smaller hands. I find it a bit of a reach for icons at the top of the screen, and drop-down menus usually demand two hands. This form-factor does feel more comfortable in my hands, though, and slides into pockets easier than Apple’s bigger Pro phones, or the Pixel 4a 5G.</p><p>Rounding out the list of specs you’d expect to see in a premium smartphone, the Xperia 1 III is running on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 chipset, with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.  It is also a little bit more 5G-friendly, working this time around with T-Mobile and Verizon bands. However, there is no mmWave support nor will it work on AT&amp;T’s 5G offering.</p><p>Sony has increased the battery size to 4,500mAh, making it notably bigger than its predecessor. Unfortunately, the Xperia 1 III struggles to last an entire day, if you keep the screen running at 120Hz, at least. On days of heavy use, I’d have to recharge the phone by early evening. After dropping the settings down from 120Hz I was typically getting just shy of a day and a half of use, which is a pretty standard figure for most high-end Android devices. The battery is big, yes, but so is the screen.</p><p></p><h3>The cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090af8c0-35a6-11ec-bfe2-e630530914ba" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review" data-uuid="cc172df3-0cfe-353f-88eb-24f18a629534"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s an open secret that Sony makes camera sensors for a lot of smartphone makers. But until recently, that didn’t translate to killer smartphone cameras for its own phones. So if the Xperia 1 II was Sony getting serious about its phone cameras, then the Xperia 1 III is Sony getting serious, focused and business-like, all at once.</p><p>As with the screen, Sony is taking its own approach with three 12-megapixel cameras of varying focal lengths. That includes a new telephoto lens that can switch between 70mm and 105mm equivalent zoom.  Sony says the variable zoom lens helps it to focus faster, which was true in my experience, although I did find there was a little bit too much blur when using the optical zoom at its maximum.</p><p>With the Mk.III, Sony also added dual-phase-detection-autofocus pixels, which, paired with 20 frames per second shooting, should offer a better chance of catching crisp shots in hectic settings. You can tap to focus and the camera will <em>track</em> moving subjects, just like a digital camera touchscreen.</p><p>Sony has pulled together an intriguing mix of (relatively) low-megapixel sensors and infused it with what it’s learned from its camera series. Compared to what iPhones and Pixel phones do with computational photography and post-processing, Sony offers a more technical approach to capturing shots.</p><p>While testing out the phone, I leaned heavily on the “auto” shooting mode, which acts like any camera app on any smartphone. But like the Xperia 1 phones before it, the Mark III comes with a pretty expansive Photography Pro app. Beyond the basic mode, you can tinker with shutter speeds, ISO, color balance and pretty much anything else.</p><p>I’ll confess that I’m not the best photographer, and so anything that helps me get a better shot, whether that’s software assistance or higher light sensitivity, is appreciated. Outside of the automatic, simplified camera mode, the Xperia 1 III has a learning curve. Unfortunately, it doesn’t quite match the experience of a Sony camera. I fumbled around for an aperture priority mode (so I could maximize bokeh effect at low f stops), but it doesn’t exist. I was tricked into thinking the Mk.III would work like a camera, but it’s still just a smartphone camera. You can adjust shooting speed and ISO, but not aperture. At times, I felt I wasn’t skilled enough to get the most from the Mk.III. I can take better photos on other flagship phones, but I think that’s due to my own photographic shortcomings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08ee9720-35a6-11ec-afc7-12965d654aee" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review" data-uuid="a6a4b5a0-6ec7-3875-a2ec-89c8d0d894bd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Xperia 1 III does great with face detection and often latches onto fast-moving people and pets. However, when you’re using the telephoto lens, the phone seems to hop between fore and background details a little too often. The usual curse of smartphone photography doesn’t escape Sony, either. Low light conditions will still mess up autofocus, no matter how smart Sony has made it. There’s no night shoot mode, either, which is curious in 2021.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/21ffe8c0-35a8-11ec-ac3e-5de841811511" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review camera samples" data-uuid="4dcb51fa-66e7-397c-b8cf-35718aff655c"><figcaption>The Xperia 1 III is excellent at ensuring faces in photos stay in focus. While most of the image is crisp, you can still clearly see the boat passengers even at this distance.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Video captured by the Mk.III was a pleasant surprise, whether shooting in 4K or 1080p. I took the phone with me during a trip to Amsterdam and recorded video both in daylight and night-time. The lack of rolling shutter, on a moving tram, and the accurate lighting as I recorded dark streets both impressed me. The footage wasn’t overly noisy or blurry either, which is something you often see from many smartphone cameras when they’re trying to accommodate a lack of light.</p><p>If you’re looking for finer control with video, Sony&#39;s Cinema Pro app returns again, offering equivalent pro controls but for video. You can select shooting modes like 10-bit color and high frame-rates while toying with built-in filters, shutter speed and even manual focus. You’ll need to come to Cinema Pro with at least a passing understanding of what all those things do. I found it a little too complicated, but at least the Mk.III offers enough screen space to tap between settings and adjust everything.</p><p>And a quick note on the front-facing camera: It’s terrible. Blurry, noisy and shockingly under-specced, at a time when we’re using selfie-cams more than ever. It’s an unusual camera miss for Sony.</p><p></p><h3>Software&nbsp;</h3><section data-eng-breakout="4f65c5b8207c45b293d36317cf66da99" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090aaaa1-35a6-11ec-aff7-5fb711179d54" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review"></section><p>Aside from the camera app, Sony has played it relatively safe in its customization of Android software in recent years. While there are a few homemade apps that you won’t touch (like the news feed one), there are some tricks you won’t find on other phones, like the ability to use Xperia 1 III as an external monitor. The feature works with cameras capable of USB Video Class (UVC) output (such as, conveniently, Sony’s Alpha camera series), but it’s very much a simple, expansive display for your camera. Having said that, this 6.5-inch 4K display is almost definitely better than whatever’s on the back of your camera.</p><p>Sony has also simplified connecting a PS4 DualShock controller to the Mk.III, with a prominent connection option within the settings app. You will probably need to pick up some kind of mount to keep the Xperia 1 III attached to your controller. Oddly, as of the time of writing, you can’t pair the PS5’s DualSense controller.</p><p></p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08ee4901-35a6-11ec-b1eb-828f177cba1e" alt="Sony Xperia 1 III review" data-uuid="610ee14c-ce02-357a-8dee-e6be8ccbce80"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Xperia 1 III is not for everyone, but for devoted smartphone camera (or Sony) fans, it’s another intriguing device, despite the prohibitive price. I can’t unequivocally say it’s the best smartphone camera, but, like its predecessors, it does things its own way, whether that’s the camera array, deeply customizable camera app or the slick, sharp 4K 120Hz screen. Does anyone need a 4K phone screen? I’m not sure, but Sony makes a better argument for it with its external display app.</p><p>The Mk.III, with its almost matte finish, looks and feels more like Sony’s family of alpha cameras, or perhaps more accurately, its high-end RX point-and-shoots, and when most other phones are backed with glass or glossy plastic, I think the Xperia 1 III has its own unique charm. Barring the iffy selfie camera, the latest Xperia 1 doesn’t do anything poorly and if you have the patience and the skill to master it, the Mk.III can take some stunning shots. For a lot of people, however, letting  Apple, Google or Samsung&#39;s software take up some of the slack will lead to better pictures, no matter how technically impressive Sony’s proposition is.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8950ecdd-ec80-441d-a2ea-9378d3e5065c</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:30:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635345446</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:37:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090a8392-35a6-11ec-bff3-6b4ccfe82283" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/090a8392-35a6-11ec-bff3-6b4ccfe82283" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Xperia 1 III review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Xperia 1 III review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's latest 'green' investments include EV charging and alternative fuel companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) kicks off on Sunday, and ahead of it some of tech&#39;s biggest companies are announcing new initiatives. Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-backs-new-companies-focused-on-low-carbon-technology">investing in three companies</a> working on creating sustainable technology as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-invests-2-billion-clean-energy-fund-183049118.html">its $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The first of these companies is Resilient Power, a company working to make delivering electricity from the power grid and delivering it to electric vehicle charging stations more efficient. The company appears primarily focused on fleets — think businesses that need to deploy vehicles en masse, like shipping services — rather than individual vehicles. The company claims it can build out EV fast-charging stations at one-tenth the standard size and installation time as current stations. Naturally, an efficient, fast-charging solution for fleets of delivery vehicles is something&nbsp;that could be directly relevant to Amazon. It also could relate to the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-amazon-rivian-investment-electric-pickup-truck-suv.html">existing investment in EV maker Rivian</a>, which could plausibly make EVs for Amazon delivery services down the line.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second company, CMC Machinery, can design and manufacture custom-fit boxes for whatever items need to go inside, without waste like extra space and single-use padding materials. Again, the benefit to Amazon is obvious here — if the company is going to continue to ship things at the rate it currently does, reducing the amount of packaging waste the company produces would be significant.</p><p>Finally, a company called Infinium is working on renewable fuel technology as an alternative to traditional diesel and jet fuels. The company claims its Infinium Electrofuels are &quot;ultra-low carbon fuels that can be used in air transport, marine freight, and heavy truck fleets.&quot; This marks Amazon&#39;s second investment round in Infinium, and it&#39;ll be used to help develop facilities for producing the company&#39;s fuel. Amazon also says that this investment will help the company actually deliver its fuel for the first time, which would be a pretty major milestone.&nbsp;</p><p>With these three new companies, Amazon is now supporting 11 total companies with its Climate Change Pledge, a key component in its plan to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2040. Given that goal, it makes sense that these investments are in companies that can directly help Amazon reduce its carbon footprint. With COP26 about to start, both Apple and Microsoft have also made announcements around moves they&#39;re making to become more eco-friendly. Apple, which plans to be carbon-neutral by 2030, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-announces-new-climate-initiatives-ahead-of-cop-26-climate-conference-131617869.html">announced</a> it has &quot;more than doubled&quot; the number of suppliers committed to using clean energy. Microsoft, meanwhile,  is hoping to reduce data center water consumption by 95 percent by 2024, just a few short years from now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-climate-pledge-fund-2021-investments-142723838.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51e56d35-cdde-404a-ae67-b39b16b5c501</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:27:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635344845</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:27:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/621f0cd0-3731-11ec-bfff-3cb1433e2e9a" width="5123" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/621f0cd0-3731-11ec-bfff-3cb1433e2e9a" width="5123" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Harvey Gonzalez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Amazon Prime delivery van sits idle beside a yellow Amazon Locker drop box where customers can collect their online deliveries on 10th August, 2021 in Leeds, United Kingdom.

The vehicle, called the <a href="https://roboat.org/">Roboat</a>, has been through multiple iterations — just last year, the lab <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mit-autonomous-roboat-ii-carries-passengers-140145138.html">tested</a> a version that can carry two passengers. This year, Roboat&#39;s creators are launching its full-scale version, which can carry up to five passengers, collect waste and deliver goods, in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p><p>The current Roboat has futuristic looks with its black and grey design and two seats facing each other. It&#39;s fully electric with 10 hours of battery life on a single charge and has wireless charging capabilities. MIT CSAIL Director Daniela Rus says it&#39;s more precise and has more robust perception, navigation and control systems that its predecessors. It also comes with new features, including close proximity approach mode that makes docking to a port or connecting to another boat easier, as well as better dynamic positioning that will help it better navigate real-world waters.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The vehicle&#39;s autonomous driving technology is similar to ones used by self-driving cars, according to CSAIL, and operates by using GPS to decide on a safe route from point A to point B. Roboat also uses LIDAR and several cameras to enable a 360-degree view that gives it a way to determine its path and avoid crashing into obstacles. The vehicle can operate on its own round-the-clock, but an onshore operator will monitor it remotely from a control center: A single operator will be able to monitor up to 50 Roboat units.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Roboats will debut on October 28th in the waters of Amsterdam.

It&#39;s unveiling the initiatives ahead of COP26, the upcoming UN conference that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/27/cop26-climate-talks-will-not-fulfil-aims-of-paris-agreement-key-players-warn">many observers feel</a> will not produce the breakthroughs needed to achieve aims set at the Paris climate accord.</p><p>As part of its 2020 <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2020.pdf">environmental progress report</a>, Apple said that its products and supply chain would be carbon neutral by 2030. That includes not just Apple itself, but 175 supplies that also need to transition to renewable energy, it wrote today. When that happens, &quot;the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world,&quot; avoiding over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually, Apple wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>In total, 175 Apple suppliers will transition to using renewable energy, and the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world. These actions will avoid over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually — the equivalent of taking over 4 million cars off the road each year.</p></blockquote><p>Apple noted that 19 suppliers in Europe are now part of its Clean Energy Program, including Solvay and STMicroelectronics. It has 50 more in China, along with 31 in Japan and South Korea, including SK Hynix, &quot;one of the first Korean suppliers to participate.&quot; Its also creating &quot;new pathways&quot; for recycled materials, including recycled sources of gold, cobalt, aluminum and rare earth elements.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple also added 10 new projects for its &quot;Power for Impact&quot; initiative designed to bring clean energy solutions to communities around the world, particularly in under-resourced communities. That includes a project with six Sioux tribes in the US to finance, develop, build and operating power generation facilities, along with renewable energy projects in South Africa, the Philippines, Columbia, Israel and elsewhere.</p><p>While Apple appears to be making good on its promise to deliver products built with 100 percent clean energy, it continues to take heat over e-waste and related right to repair issues. Many of its products are difficult and expensive to repair, meaning that they either end up as e-waste or recycled toward new products. Both of those things use energy, clean or otherwise, that wouldn&#39;t be consumed if the product was simply fixed.</p><p>Recently, President Biden ordered the FTC to draft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">right to repair</a> legislation, and Europe announced that it would take measures forcing phone manufacturers to use USB-C — both rules that seem to primarily target Apple.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-announces-new-climate-initiatives-ahead-of-cop-26-climate-conference-131617869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99b4c397-d7e2-4138-970a-da4833d9f051</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:16:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635343470</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:04:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0cf5f2a0-3727-11ec-a9ed-85db23d6fc59" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0cf5f2a0-3727-11ec-a9ed-85db23d6fc59" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple announces new climate initiatives ahead of the COP26 climate conference]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple announces new climate initiatives ahead of the COP26 climate conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber will rent up to 50,000 Tesla EVs to drivers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s now clear why Hertz is buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">so many Tesla cars</a>.

The firm could burnish its image with eco-friendly cars roaming the streets.

The company also has a tradition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-sharp-shot-213047501.html">previewing experimental tools</a> that may make it to the likes of Photoshop and others. As part of its &quot;sneaks&quot; session today, Adobe will demo Project In-Between: an AI-based tool that creates what the company calls &quot;living photos&quot; from separate still images.&nbsp;</p><p>Using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-sensei-ai-sky-replacement-preview-155256593.html">Adobe Sensei AI</a>, the tool makes an animation between two or more photos with a single click. Project In-Between will also let you choose the number of transition frames with a higher number creating faster motion. Once it&#39;s done, you can access the in-between frames individually as well. There is a big caveat though: your images have to be similar. For example, you could use an image of a person smiling and one of them not in the same general pose. If the images are too different, the results get weird quickly as the transitions become more like transformations. Adobe says the feature can also be applied to video to create slow-motion clips.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="bd74c6a8-c75e-4a66-860e-c4fd72b747b5"/><p>Adobe sees Project In-Between as a way to make photos you take on your phone more interesting. The company explains that the results of the tool could be posted as GIFs to social channels and various other places. With that in mind, it will be interesting to see if Adobe can bake this technology into a mobile app so that you can do all of the editing on your phone, and keep the results there for easy posting.&nbsp;</p><p>Adobe has shown off dozens of experimental features over the years at its Max event. In fact, the Sneaks portion of the festivities has become so popular, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-adobe-experimental-sneaks-editing.html">schedules a dedicated session</a> entirely devoted to previews of technology that&#39;s in development. Of course, not all &quot;sneaks&quot; make the leap to full-on features in Creative Cloud apps. However, some of them do, with Photoshop&#39;s powerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH0aEp1oDOI">Content Aware Fill</a> perhaps being the most famous example, demoed long before &quot;sneaks&quot; became as popular as they are today.&nbsp;</p><p>You can expect to see a demo of Project In-Between and this year&#39;s other &quot;sneaks&quot; during an Adobe Max session <a href="https://www.adobe.com/max/2021/sessions/na-max-sneaks-with-kenan-thompson-mb130.html">at 12PM ET</a> today.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/201be430-3721-11ec-b7ff-6b89ffaa96eb" alt="Adobe Project In-Between" data-uuid="ac6675d4-2802-3fc5-9455-88127edf9d8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-project-in-between-preview-130017575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b587f10-fae6-471e-85ac-131cb428eb76</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635338757</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T12:46:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9eab3980-3722-11ec-be5f-3f90f7e9f1a5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9eab3980-3722-11ec-be5f-3f90f7e9f1a5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe Project In-Between]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Project In-Between]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blink security cameras are up to 33 percent off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The holiday shopping season is a good time to invest in smart home gadgets since many are heavily discounted.

A one-camera <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blink Outdoor kit" href="https://amzn.to/3vPkksi">Blink Outdoor kit</a> is down to $70, while it&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Indoor equivalent" href="https://amzn.to/2ZBpNrd">Indoor equivalent</a> is on sale for $60 — both were $10 cheaper on Prime Day back in June, but this is the best price we&#39;ve seen since then. Also, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blink Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3nxp1n9">Blink Mini</a> is down to $25, which is only $5 more than it was on Prime Day.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3biNDKB" id="d21c7a2f22824884b9c60c624ef85682" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Blink sale at Amazon</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3vPkksi" id="baedba604bb845d2a6b4958a36504b49" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Outdoor (1 camera kit) at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2ZBpNrd" id="20d056136c5a4136939a668c8497ce03" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Indoor (1 camera kit) at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nxp1n9" id="4eebcff23aee41808a7ebab9836871db" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Mini at Amazon - $25</a><p>The biggest selling point for these <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-indoor-blink-outdoor-four-years-battery-172839714.html">cameras</a> is that they&#39;re wireless. Both the Outdoor and Indoor models are untethered and run on AA batteries, so you can place them almost anywhere you want with or without the help of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:mounts" href="https://amzn.to/2XT3I6G">mounts</a>. Aside from the Blink Outdoor being weather resistant, the two types of cameras are mostly the same. Both record 1080p video, have infrared night vision and can send motion detection alerts to your phone. They also support two-way audio, so you can speak to the person (or animal, even) on the other end of your video feed if you wish. And as with most Amazon-backed gadgets, these cameras support Alexa voice commands and you can view video feeds from any Echo Show devices you may have around your home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Blink Mini is a bit different in that it actually is a wired camera and it&#39;s also more compact. While it&#39;s less versatile than the standard Blink devices, it&#39;s the better choice if you want to give the system a go before investing in a bunch of additional cameras. Plus, you&#39;re not missing out on any features: the Blink Mini also records in 1080p, supports motion alerts and two-way audio, and it works with Alexa.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blink-security-cameras-are-up-to-33-percent-off-right-now-124022812.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e960c7c1-eb59-45c5-935e-5e5fe9b675c8</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:40:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635338891</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T12:48:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/d1db0690-ee09-11ea-bb6e-072e94cfe6fd" width="1974" height="1144" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/d1db0690-ee09-11ea-bb6e-072e94cfe6fd" width="1974" height="1144" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Blink Outdoor and Indoor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blink Outdoor and Indoor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analysis reveals coordinated Twitter campaign against Harry and Meghan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of the Harry-and-Meghan hate you see on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-everyone-ios-android-223459655.html">Twitter</a> comes from a relatively small number of accounts, according to Bot Sentinel. The Twitter analytics service has <a href="https://botsentinel.com/newsroom/reports">published</a> a report examining activity on the website related to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and found that around 70 percent of the hateful and negative comments about the couple originated from 83 accounts. That signifies targeted harassment against the Sussexes, mostly against Meghan Markle.</p><p>Bot Sentinel CEO Christopher Bouzy told <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/bot-sentinel-meghan-markle-prince-harry-twitter"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a> that the anti-Meghan campaign on the website isn&#39;t like anything his team has ever seen before. Why? Because there&#39;s no motive. It&#39;s not like the #StopTheSteal movement that aims to overturn the results of the 2020 US Presidential Elections. &quot;Are these people who hate her? Is it racism? Are they trying to hurt [Harry and Meghan&#39;s] credibility? Your guess is as good as ours,&quot; he said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And by &quot;people,&quot; he means actual people. The accounts aren&#39;t bots, but actual users who know how to manipulate the platform&#39;s algorithms. They avoid detection and avoid being banned for violating Twitter&#39;s Terms of Service, for instance, by pairing negative comments about Harry and Meghan with positive ones about William and Kate. &quot;This level of complexity comes from people who know how to do this stuff, who are paid to do this stuff,&quot; Bouzy said.</p><p>Bot Sentinel sampled 114,000 tweets with hashtags and keywords related to the Sussexes, such as  #HarryandMeghan and #MeghanMarkle. In the end, it identified a total of 55 accounts to be the ones primarily responsible for negative content against the Sussexes, while the rest (28 accounts) were mostly used to amplify the content they produced. Bouzy called the content they generate &quot;organic hate,&quot; which can fly under the radar and evade detection by automated systems.</p><p>According to <em>BuzzFeed News</em>, Twitter has already suspended four of the accounts named in the report, while six more set their profiles to private.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-analysis-coordinated-campaign-harry-meghan-122510226.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c4d535e-15f0-4f3c-a06c-b88f04a7d375</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 12:15:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635336598</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T12:10:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20157ac0-2b1c-11ec-a7f7-a6c2aa592e76" width="4436" height="2907" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20157ac0-2b1c-11ec-a7f7-a6c2aa592e76" width="4436" height="2907" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Britain's Prince Harry and Meghan Markle speak during the 2021 Global Citizen Live festival at the Great Lawn, Central Park on September 25, 2021 in New York City.

It can be a rice cooker, a slow cooker, a pressure cooker, and some models even let you make yogurt. A few years ago, the company released the Instant Pot Smart WiFi, which let you control it remotely from your phone. Now, there’s a brand new connected model called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Instant Pot Pro Plus" href="https://fave.co/2XOLCma">Instant Pot Pro Plus</a> (priced at $169.99) that promises to do that, and more.</p><div id="2f939ba599634d37b820b92733f2b8be"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiPfZaybJZ4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Similar to the Smart WiFi, you can connect the Instant Pot Pro Plus to your phone over WiFi. You can then use the Instant Pot app to start or stop cooking, check the timing and monitor the progress from anywhere in the home. But the Pro Plus can do more than that. The app has over 1,500 “smart” recipes, which have the timing, pressure levels and venting preferences already pre-programmed in, so all you need to do is follow the step-by-step instructions to prepare your meal. Plus, you can release the steam valve remotely and enter in a delayed start time. You can also create your own custom recipe with programmable venting methods (you can choose from natural release, pulse release or quick release).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Instant Pot Pro Plus has other improvements too. For one thing, it has a much sleeker design, with a large and bright LCD screen. The stainless steel inner pot has an extra-thick aluminum layer that promises more efficient heating, and it has a flat bottom that can go on any stove top. It even has “easy grip” handles that make the inner pot easier to maneuver. The Pro Plus features sous-vide, food warmer, sterilizer and cake maker modes as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The Instant Pot Pro Plus is available now from the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Instant Pot website" href="https://fave.co/3pDUbff">Instant Pot website</a>, Amazon and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Williams-Sonoma;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Williams-Sonoma" href="https://fave.co/2XOLCma">Williams-Sonoma</a> for $169.99.

Human rights groups believe over a million Uyghurs are being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037"><ins>detained</ins></a> in internment camps, but China continues to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/china-denies-uighur-abuse-claims-as-international-pressure-grows"><ins>deny</ins></a> the allegations.

This follows the commission’s actions regarding networking infrastructure from Huawei and ZTE, two companies that bore the brunt of accusations of being threats to national security. The one-time Huawei subsidiary, phone maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-commerce-department-entity-list-consideration-193403546.html"><ins>Honor</ins></a>, is still waiting to see if it’s going to be labeled similarly.

Google first announced the option <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-major-safety-changes-for-kids-on-search-you-tube-and-more-130051206.html">back in August</a> as part of a slate of new <a href="https://blog.google/technology/families/giving-kids-and-teens-safer-experience-online/">safety measures</a> for kids, but it&#39;s now rolling out widely to users.&nbsp;</p><p>Google said it will remove any images of minors &quot;with the exception of case of compelling public interest or newsworthiness.&quot; The requests can be made by minors, their parents, guardians or other legal representatives.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To do so, you&#39;ll need to supply the URLs you want removed, the name and age of the minor and the name of the person acting on their behalf. Google notes that &quot;web URLs (pages with both text and images) are not eligible for removal under this policy, which seeks to limit the presence of images in Google search results.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, it also can&#39;t remove images from websites hosting them, so &quot;you might&nbsp;wish to contact the site’s webmaster and ask them to remove the content,&quot; Google said. To aid in that, it linked a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109">guide</a> on how to contact a site&#39;s webmaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Until Google starts to actively remove images, we won&#39;t see what criteria it applies for &quot;public interest or newsworthiness.&quot; In general, though, it seems like most images will likely get pulled if a minor or their guardian asks. However, it doesn&#39;t appear that you&#39;ll be able to demand the removal of images of yourself below 18 unless you&#39;re currently under that age, as <em>The Verge</em> has noted.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-under-18-image-search-removal-option-is-now-widely-available-110634356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02a5b2ca-2b96-4a87-9ee9-fc33b2a976b1</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 11:06:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635332797</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T11:06:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google closeup logo displayed on a phone screen, smartphone on a keyboard is seen in this multiple exposure illustration, the company's symbol is globally recognized.
