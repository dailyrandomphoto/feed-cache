The automaker has <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/oct/news-4100018.html">unveiled</a> an autonomous wheel loader prototype, the LX03, that&#39;s based on a Lego model — 42081 Lego Technic Concept Wheel Loader Zeux, if you&#39;re looking for it. The machine can haul 5 tons and can make its own decisions in a wide variety of situations, including team-ups with human workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The LX03 is also uniquely modular. Volvo can make &quot;just one or two changes&quot; to produce a larger or smaller loader to meet a customer&#39;s demands. It&#39;s unsurprisingly electric and can last for up to eight hours depending on the job. It should be available for a typical workday, then.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prototype isn&#39;t indicative of a production model.

Many mobile gamers would love to know when they can log on for special item drops, for example.

Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-consider-text-988-expand-suicide-prevention-services">proposed</a> an order that would let people text 988 to reach the Lifeline. Carriers would have to automatically route texts to 988 to the Lifeline&#39;s full number (1-800-273-8255) no later than July 16th, 2022. Providers would have to support every messaging format the Lifeline can handle, and the FCC would explore the possibility of texting the Veterans Crisis Line.</p><p>The move would not only accommodate younger people more familiar with texting, but would make the Lifeline more accessible to people with disabilities, according to the FCC. The regulator also suggested this would offer a &quot;certain level of anonymity&quot; for people who aren&#39;t comfortable with phone conversations. The FCC will hold a vote on the proposal at its November 18th meeting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Lifeline already supports <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/">online chats</a> through the web. As Rosenworcel explained, however, this is a bid to &quot;meet [people] where they are&quot; and give them a choice in a moment of crisis. Americans would have more opportunities to get help, and might be more inclined to get that help in the first place.</p><p><em>In the U.S., the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is </em><a><em>1-800-273-8255</em></a><em>.

Specifically, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-zhurong-rover-selfie-photo-212920780.html">China&#39;s selfie-taking Zhurong rover</a>, which has been on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnsa-zhurong-rover-095207429.html">Red Planet since May</a>, will try to shoot data over to the ESA&#39;s Mars Express Orbiter.&nbsp;</p><p>As the<a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/"> ESA explains</a>, Zhurong can&#39;t actually receive any communications from the Express Orbiter, due to a radio incompatibility. That means it can&#39;t hear the hail signal sent from the orbiter, which is typically what a rover waits for before it starts sending out data. Instead, next month Mars and the ESA will attempt a new method that&#39;s previously only been tested on Earth. During five tests, Zhurong will send a signal blindly into space, and the Mars Express will listen for that signal and any potential data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;If [Mars Express] detects the magic signal, the radio will lock on to it and begin recording any data,&quot; <a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/">ESA&#39;s Josh Tapley writes</a>. &quot;At the end of the communication window, the spacecraft will turn to face Earth and relay these data across space the same way it does for other scientific Mars missions. When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter — that&#39;s commonly been seen as a smart backup method — but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That&#39;ll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/esa-mars-express-china-zhurong-rover-test-190629849.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a59b8ee-55f6-44c9-8f8e-6229a2011956</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:06:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635363064</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T19:31:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNSA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olympus cameras will be rebranded as OM System]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/olympus/"><ins>Olympus cameras</ins></a> are getting a new name.

The cost is lower too, at $1,400, compared with the Onewheel+ XR&#39;s starting price of $1,799. It&#39;s more expensive than the $950 Onewheel Pint.

The company designed the board from scratch, and it includes a new control system with a higher voltage. That, according to Future Motion, will deliver more power, torque and dynamic performance at all speeds. In fact, it&#39;s the first three-horsepower Onewheel.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ba2ed00-3689-11ec-bdfb-639b04e51d09" alt="Onewheel GT" data-uuid="87885ac1-9ff9-3e20-853e-b12f4c60969f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Future Motion</div></figure><p>A new battery system will keep the Onewheel GT rolling for up to 32 miles on a single charge, the company claims. Elsewhere, Future Motion says the built-in Maghandle Pro and LED headlights are over 300 percent brighter than lighting in other models, so the GT might be more viable for nighttime rides. The footpads might be more comfortable too, since they&#39;re concave on both sides. In addition, there&#39;s a version with a treaded tire for increased traction.</p><p>The Onewheel GT is also available starting today, but a premium product means a higher price. It starts at $2,200. However, Future Motion is sweetening the deal for the first 48 hours with promotional offers such as bundle savings up to $275, free fenders and free priority shipping to the lower 48 states.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/onewheel-gt-pint-x-future-motion-180021707.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e65bfb8-69e1-45a6-a571-7d4edf4c4dc8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635359514</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T18:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/598af0a0-3689-11ec-af7d-20caf4cdfc2d" width="5884" height="3393" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/598af0a0-3689-11ec-af7d-20caf4cdfc2d" width="5884" height="3393" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Motion]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Onewheel GT and Pint X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Onewheel GT and Pint X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Copyright Office provides a path to allow for more device repairs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The right to repair movement just got a big boost from the US Copyright Office. Responding to proposals from a variety of organizations, including the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro">iFixit</a>, the office on Wednesday recommended new exemptions to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">Section 1201</a> of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as it relates to the repair of consumer electronics. The statute prohibits the circumvention of software copy protection and has been the target of right to repair advocates for years.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747310/us-copyright-office-dmca-section-1201-exemption-rulemaking-report"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Copyright Office <a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/copyright/1201/2021/2021_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">recommends</a> additional protections for many consumer-facing devices that rely on software to function. As one example, it adopts a recommendation from Public Knowledge and iFixit that involves video game consoles. It says “the repair of software-enabled consumer devices is likely to be fair use, the Register finds that certain video game console repair is also likely fair use.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It notes consumers can access the firmware on their systems as long as it’s with the intention of fixing the device’s optical drive and they restore any protective measures afterward. The rulemaking stops short of protecting non-consumer devices. However, the Library of Congress has <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf">signed off on the recommendations</a>, paving the way for them to go into effect on October 28th. In a statement to Engadget, the EFF applauded the decision but said Congress needs to modify Section 1201.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The new rules enacted by the Librarian of Congress represent a victory for security research, accessibility, education, preservation, and repair. While the exemptions do continue to contain unnecessary and harmful limitations, we&#39;re pleased with the additional freedom to operate that the Librarian granted in this rulemaking. The largest disappointment, however, is that the agency failed to protect the public&#39;s ability to make non-infringing modifications of device software as we requested. This kind of user innovation has been a profoundly important driver of advances in technology and lets communities who are not served by a technology&#39;s default functions to customize them to their own needs. We are also mindful that the rulemaking process is inherently limited: while the Librarian can authorize people to engage in circumvention, they cannot create exemptions to the part of the law (Section 1201(a)(2)) that prohibits the dissemination of the technology needed to achieve circumvention. Congress needs to remove that restriction in order to give these legal rights to circumvent their full practical effect.</p></blockquote><p>iFixit had a similar take on the decision.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We&#39;re glad the Register of Copyrights finally agreed that copyright law shouldn&#39;t keep you from fixing your stuff — regardless of what &#39;type&#39; of device it is. A legal solution for repairing optical drives on Xboxes and PlayStations is long overdue, and will help put desperately needed bricked consoles back in service. Unfortunately, the new rules still maintain some absurd limitations — like excluding commercial devices and noninfringing modification of software-enabled devices (like changing the settings on a software-enabled cat litter box). Particularly troubling is the Register&#39;s reliance on potential service contracts with manufacturers in order to deny the exemption for repair of commercial or industrial equipment. If repair is non-infringing (which it is) then manufacturers&#39; monopoly-preserving service contracts shouldn&#39;t prevent the Office from granting anbear on the issuance of the exemption. Moreover, the Copyright Office&#39;s process has some fatal flaws: exemption proponents have to return every three years to argue that their exemptions be renewed (a process that is both time and resource intensive), and it doesn&#39;t address whether people can make or distribute repair tools that circumvent manufacturer&#39;s digital locks. Without access to those tools, the exemptions are largely academic. This is why Congress needs to step in an permanently exempt repair, and repair tools, from Section 1201. Copyright Law should never stand in the way of repair. Until Congress finally fixes Section 1201 and grants a permanent right to repair, we’re going to be stuck on this ferris wheel with the Copyright Office every three years.</p></blockquote><p>The decision will complement the efforts of the Biden administration on the same front. At the start of July, the president <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">ordered the Federal Trade Commission</a> to draft new rules to empower consumers and businesses to repair their devices on their own and at independent shops. The executive order marked the first time a US president had ever weighed in on the right to repair movement. Later that same month, the FTC complied with the directive, voting unanimously to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html">tackle unlawful repair restrictions</a>. At the time, it said it would work with law enforcement and policymakers to update existing regulations to protect small businesses and companies that would prevent them from fixing their own products.</p><p><strong>Update 2:03PM ET</strong>: Added comment from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. We&#39;ve also changed the headline to better reflect the nature of the Copyright Office&#39;s rulemaking.</p><p><strong>Update 2:51PM ET</strong>: Added comment from iFixit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-copyright-office-section-1203-exemptions-172514601.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94a8f974-13dc-42bd-b8fb-08a3cd143078</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:25:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635361057</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T18:57:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f0e0c00-3747-11ec-bfd3-bdafb5f07762" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f0e0c00-3747-11ec-bfd3-bdafb5f07762" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[aldarinho via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toronto, Canada - May, 23,2020: Close up of disassemble game controller repairing, cleaning or diagnostic.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Close up of disassemble game controller repairing, cleaning or diagnostic.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's own TVs will support AirPlay 2 and HomeKit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">first in-house TVs</a> may be showcases for Alexa, but that isn&#39;t precluding the company from supporting someone else&#39;s ecosystem. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747811/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-apple-airplay-2-homekit">According</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, Amazon has unveiled plans to add support for Apple&#39;s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to both higher-end Omni and budget 4-series Fire TV sets now that they&#39;re available. You can use AirPlay 2 to cast content from your iPhone, iPad or Mac, but the HomeKit integration may be the most notable — yes, you can use Siri to control an Amazon TV as part of your wider smart home network. Amazon would only say the support was coming &quot;soon.&quot;</p><p>The TVs themselves start <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV 4-series" href="https://amzn.to/3jJyUgd">at $370</a> for the 4-series, which provide the usual Fire TV integrations along with 4K and HDR support in sizes ranging from 43 inches to 55 inches. Omni sets, meanwhile, deliver Alexa-friendly far-field microphones and (on the two largest models) Dolby Vision HDR. They start <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6DZ81T/">at $410</a> and range from 43 inches to 75 inches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expansion isn&#39;t a complete shock. Insignia- and Toshiba-made Fire TV Edition sets <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-airplay-2-homekit-update-013526800.html">received AirPlay and HomeKit support</a> in July. We&#39;d add that Apple and Amazon are relatively cozy. Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-14-apple-music-works-on-echo-speakers.html">Echo speakers have streamed Apple Music</a> since 2018, for instance, while Prime Video integrates with the Apple TV app. Amazon has a strong incentive to include AirPlay and HomeKit, if just to fend off competition from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-update-features-from-google-tv-160004195.html">Android TV</a> and sets that rely on Google Assistant.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em> observed, though, there&#39;s no mention of either Apple platform coming to add-on media players like the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. For now, you&#39;ll have to buy hardware like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-os-10-airplay-2-homekit-support-hd-devices-130003400.html">modern Roku devices</a> to bring AirPlay and HomeKit to TVs where they aren&#39;t built-in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-airplay-2-homekit-support-171505953.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bde172a4-c133-4022-9648-c748645b344c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635353597</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:53:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f5a0d50-3740-11ec-be3e-c8f57be2f9d0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f5a0d50-3740-11ec-be3e-c8f57be2f9d0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Omni]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Omni]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to use SharePlay on iOS 15]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iOS 15.1 was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-group-workout-shareplay-available-now-170031703.html">released yesterday</a>, which means you can finally start checking out Apple&#39;s long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html">SharePlay feature</a>. After seeing how buggy it was on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">the iOS 15 beta</a>, I was able to check out SharePlay this week during a briefing with Apple, and the experience was surprisingly smooth. Though SharePlay works with just <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388">a small collection of apps</a> at the moment, it&#39;s also coming soon to Disney+, while the NBA and TikTok apps will be updated today to support it. I watched a few videos and a Milwaukee Bucks game via these apps on my demo, and beyond being impressed by how much more stable everything is since the beta, I also found some tips particularly useful.</p><h2>Setup and starting a SharePlay session</h2><p>First, make sure you and your friends all update your devices to iOS 15.1 or iPadOS 15.1. Just like we observed in the beta, you need to start a FaceTime call before you can SharePlay anything. Once you&#39;re on a call, open a supported app and you&#39;ll see an alert at the top of the screen asking if you want to stream your content. When you start a session, your callers will see a box pop up at the top of the screen to join you.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the most part, everyone you&#39;re SharePlaying with will need to have the relevant apps installed (i.e. TikTok, HBO Max, Showtime, Paramount, Apple TV etc). In some cases, they&#39;ll also need to have a subscription or at least an account.&nbsp;</p><p>While you watch a show together, anyone on the call can pause, skip forward or rewind, and that will bring everyone to the same point on the stream. As you watch something, FaceTime will run in picture-in-picture mode on top of your display, and whoever on your call is talking will appear in that box.&nbsp;</p><h2>Share your screen</h2><p>If you want to share your screen instead of watching a show, though, you&#39;ll need to tap on the screen while on your FaceTime call to pull up the commands panel and press the button on the right that resembles a person in front of a rectangle.&nbsp;</p><p>While you&#39;re sharing your screen, your friend can pinch to zoom on what you&#39;re showing them. But during a screen share session, your alerts (or other notices that pop up) won&#39;t appear on their screen, in case there&#39;s sensitive info you don&#39;t want others seeing. The pill on the top left of your screen will also turn purple to let remind you you&#39;re screen-sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was watching someone share their screen, by the way, I could still go back to my own phone and open another app. FaceTime&#39;s picture-in-picture tile showed my caller&#39;s screen with their face in an embedded picture-in-picture. Inception!</p><h2>Other features</h2><p>The controls box also lets you access the iMessage window for everyone on the call. You can continue to watch a game on the NBA app with your family without your camera or mic on, and send texts instead. That&#39;s particularly helpful when you need a toilet break when a game runs long.</p><p>Apple also built a feature called smart volume to automatically lower the streaming audio when you&#39;re speaking so everyone can hear you. This works best with AirPods, but it&#39;ll also work with your device&#39;s speaker.</p><p>Depending on each app&#39;s developers, other tools can be embedded to make them more useful. In Apple Music, for example, you can look at the song&#39;s lyrics as they play in real time, and tapping on a specific lyric will bring you and your callers to that point in the track. When you&#39;re all on TikTok together, each person can like the videos they want, too. The popular game Heads Up will also be coming to SharePlay so you can guess the word on your face while your friends act it out for you.&nbsp;</p><p>SharePlay works with iPhones, iPads and Apple TVs, and most playback features are the same across Apple&#39;s ecosystem. Those with Apple Watches will also be able to use this feature for group workouts or meditations on Fitness+ with up to 32 callers. So far, SharePlay works with just a few apps, but as more developers integrate it, iOS users could find more ways to socialize and digitally gather with loved ones soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74c073cf-7de1-44c1-88d7-ad4eb826e218</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635353980</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:59:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91f1f5e0-3744-11ec-bea7-46a0fa6a73ae" width="3900" height="2310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91f1f5e0-3744-11ec-bea7-46a0fa6a73ae" width="3900" height="2310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A composite of three images showing how SharePlay on iOS 15 works.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SharePlay on iOS 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google is giving Android on tablets another shot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case there wasn&#39;t enough news this week, Google is revealing a new version of Android that&#39;s designed for larger screens like tablets and foldables. It&#39;s called Android 12L, and is really just a set of new features for the existing OS that are optimized for big screens. The developer preview is available today as an SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/">on Google&#39;s site</a> so app makers can begin taking in some of the new features that should make for a more cohesive experience on devices with bigger displays. The public version of 12L will arrive early next year, &quot;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldables,&quot; the company said. The preview will also be &quot;coming soon to the Lenovo P12 Pro.&quot;</p><p>While Android already supports a sort of multi-window experience, there are still areas of the interface that feel more like a blown up version of a phone OS, rather than something that makes better use of the increased space. One of the things coming to Android 12L is a two-column layout for the notification shade and lockscreen when the system detects that the screen is above <a href="https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html#pixel-density">600dps</a> wide. Google said other system surfaces and apps will adopt this look too, though it didn&#39;t specify which yet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Android 12L will also feature a taskbar at the bottom of larger screens that will let you more easily open apps. This will also simplify the process of launching things in split-screen mode: just drag and drop an icon from the taskbar. Google is also enabling all apps to run in split screen, regardless of whether they are resizable.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b044ea20-373a-11ec-97ce-94d84a270f05" alt="An animation showing how to drag and drop icons from the new task bar on Android 12L to launch an app in split screen." data-uuid="502dde2b-0193-37bf-8e27-f4e35398c566"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cosmetically, Google is also adding tools that let developers make their apps look better in various windows or views. They&#39;ll be able to use custom letterbox colors or treatments, apply custom rounded corners and adjust the position of inset windows.&nbsp;</p><p>The above features are already available for preview in the developer software, but there are also changes coming that app creators have to apply for users to experience them. Google recommends that developers create versions of their UI tailored to the window size class of each device, and it&#39;s added reference devices for programmers to see their layouts across phones, tablets, foldable&#39;s larger internal displays and desktops.&nbsp;</p><p>For devices that can fold, Android 12L will offer an API that will allow developers to make their apps aware of hinges or other boundaries, and use them &quot;as natural separators.&quot; This means that when supported, you might be able to use an app like Kindle and have it show a two-column layout when your device is folded and expand to fullscreen when you open your phone completely flat.</p><p>Google is also adding ways to make adopting this easier for developers with a new Activity embedding tool and other updates in the Jetpack Window Manager library. The interface will be backward-compatible, so those using older versions of Android can still use apps that are optimized for 12L.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/79125420-36a9-11ec-afff-89ccaa22737b" alt="An animation showing the Messages app expand into a two-column layout when its screen is extended." data-uuid="a0620ac0-d661-3648-b9ce-57e07d5e6d4d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The company is also releasing its Material You design system to Jetpack Compose, so that developers can add the adaptive theming capabilities to their apps. This means that, when supported, third-party apps can also take on the color scheme that Google derived from your wallpaper, and buttons or menu highlight hues can reflect the palette for a more cohesive look throughout Android 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, to give developers a reason (or disincentive) to get their apps optimized for Android 12L, Google is updating the Play Store. It will check each app against its <a href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality">large screen app quality guidelines</a> and take the results into ranking and search listing considerations. It&#39;ll go even further by warning people on bigger devices with notices on an app&#39;s Play Store page if it&#39;s not been optimized for 12L.&nbsp;</p><p>Android has long faced criticism over being a poor OS for tablets and bigger displays, and 12L does appear promising. Google also announced some updates to make it easier for developers to code for WearOS, including offering Jetpack Compose support for the platform. It looks like the company is working hard to improve areas that it&#39;s been behind Apple on, and we&#39;ll have to see how developers take to these changes to know if Google&#39;s tablet, foldable and smartwatch dreams might succeed.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9443d30-d371-468b-b5a8-a37777773a6c</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635354372</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T17:06:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a3bbc80-36a9-11ec-befe-f81a460fcf06" width="1600" height="848" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a3bbc80-36a9-11ec-befe-f81a460fcf06" width="1600" height="848" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Examples of Google's Android 12L on four different devices: A phone, foldable, tablet and vertical tablet.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12L]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hinge users can send voice messages and add audio notes to profiles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hinge/"><ins>Hinge</ins></a> is the latest dating app that&#39;s making a push into audio.

The Dell brand has <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:released" href="https://bit.ly/3ElGu8S">released</a> both the Intel-powered Aurora R13 (above) and AMD-based Aurora Ryzen Edition R14 with their expected chassis redesign and, for the R13, a processor upgrade. The Intel machine now uses 12th-generation Core (aka Alder Lake) processors ranging from a 10-core 3.7GHz Core i5 through to the unlocked 16-core, 3.2GHz Core i9K and i9KF. The AMD models continue to use Ryzen 5000-series chips up to and including the 16-core 5950X.</p><p>The highlight, as you might expect, remains that distinct Legend 2.0 chassis. You can expect 50 percent more internal volume, tool-free entry, more customizable lighting and a more widely available clear side panel. That and an overall cleaner layout should help the Aurora run cooler and quieter than its predecessor while still allowing for easier upgrades. It probably won&#39;t sway you if you&#39;re determined to build your own rig, but it could make life easier if you&#39;re content to buy a pre-built system.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The R13 and Ryzen R14 models are available today starting at $1,250 for the AMD machine and $1,480 for its Intel-equipped counterpart. Upgrade options will remain familiar and include up to 128GB of RAM, GeForce RTX 3090 or RX 6900 XT graphics and 4TB of total storage (2TB SSD and 2TB spinning disk).</p><p>And don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re a creator who&#39;d prefer a more sedate case — Dell has you covered as well. The company has <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/scc/sr/desktops/xps-desktops">teased</a> a new XPS Desktop (below) that maintains the &#39;safe&#39; design of before, but in a much larger (27L versus 19L) form that improves airflow and customization in the toolless chassis. You&#39;ll have to be content with &#39;just&#39; 12th-gen Intel Core i5, i7 and i9 processors, but you&#39;ll have the same memory, graphics and storage choices. You can use liquid cooling, too, if fan noise or throttling are issues.</p><p>The new XPS tower arrives later in the fall starting at $919. As such, it might be the better buy if you&#39;re more interested in raw power than an attention-grabbing enclosure.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a7140900-36a3-11ec-bfb7-f0c6f39b0c8c" alt="Dell XPS Desktop (2021)" data-uuid="ae2f4c6e-39cd-3de6-83c4-01fe34512537"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-dell-12th-gen-intel-core-160047036.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3325f503-d70d-47ff-8151-eceac8877386</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635351405</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:16:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6a956b80-369f-11ec-bfff-d64308d7454f" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6a956b80-369f-11ec-bfff-d64308d7454f" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware Aurora R13 gaming desktop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware Aurora R13 gaming desktop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel's hybrid 12th-gen chips are a major strike against AMD]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;ve been hearing about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-tiger-lake-superfin-xe-graphics-130023003.html">Intel&#39;s powerful hybrid chips</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">so long</a>, they&#39;ve achieved almost mythical status. The idea behind them is intriguing: they feature both performance-cores (P-cores) and and efficient-cores (E-cores) on a single die, giving you chips that can be beefy and a bit more power-conscious, depending on the task.

And maybe, just maybe, it&#39;ll be able to steal the spotlight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-zen-3-ryzen-5000-cpu-162431364.html">back from AMD</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html">Apple</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to their hybrid configuration, these 12th-gen chips are also the first under the &quot;Intel 7&quot; process technology, which was previously seen as a refined 10nm design. When Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">revised its product roadmap in July with new names</a>, it seemed to just be steering us away from its 7nm delays. But the performance of these 12th-gen chips may be enough to justify the new branding.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b34acd90-372e-11ec-87ff-d055a4a78504" style="height:1240;width:2000;" alt="Intel 12th-gen CPU die from the bottom" data-uuid="7b3d587d-c12a-37da-91f4-9df855a7fa46"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>Intel is throwing some major numbers around: it says 12th-gen chips are up to 19 percent faster than 11th-gen CPUs overall, and they&#39;re twice as fast in the Adobe After Effects Pulse benchmark. When it comes to multithreaded performance (tasks built specifically for more than one core, like video and 3D rendering), the company claims the top-end i9-12900K is 50 percent faster than last year&#39;s 11900K while using less power. And even better, it can achieve performance parity while using only around a quarter of the power. Basically, everyone who held off on upgrading over the last few years is in for a treat, as these chips promise to be a big leap forward.</p><p>Intel&#39;s 12th-gen Core chips can fit in up to 16 cores on the i9-12900K. That&#39;s a combination of 8 P-cores and 8 E-cores, with a total of 24 process threads (every P-core counts double, since they support hyper-threading, but the E-cores don&#39;t). Given that this is an entirely new way of designing its chips, the company also worked together to develop a new Thread Director with Microsoft, which intelligently assigns tasks to the appropriate core. That way you don&#39;t have to manually assign a background thread to an E-core, or start mucking about your settings once you start working on concurrent tasks. (If the hybrid core design seems familiar, it&#39;s because ARM has been pushing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-10-20-arm-unveils-cortex-a7-processor-big-little-computing.html">something similar for the past decade</a> with its big.LITTLE technology on mobile CPUs.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/711eb070-372f-11ec-9fff-558e2a400f99" style="height:1276;width:2352;" alt="Intel 12th-gen CPU charts" data-uuid="c7ce7f97-77be-30e6-a8b5-d815d383c930"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>Intel claims P-cores can perform up to 28 percent faster than its 10th-gen Comet Lake S chips in single-threaded performance. The E-cores, meanwhile, are just as fast as the 10th-gen hardware on their own. As you&#39;d expect, these chips shine best when you&#39;re throwing serious workloads at them. Intel says the i9-12900K can get around up to 84 percent higher framerates while playing <em>Mount and Blade II</em> and streaming over OBS, compared to the previous generation chip. Similarly, it&#39;s 47 percent faster while multi-tasking with Adobe Lightroom Classic and Premiere Pro.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/711e6250-372f-11ec-afff-eca5e1ce9e18" style="height:1322;width:2400;" alt="Intel 12th-gen CPU charts" data-uuid="844d2340-0d62-35ef-836a-6feeb98cbb52"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>Intel&#39;s figures sound impressive when compared to its own hardware, but the company also noted that its Ryzen benchmarks were run before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-microsoft-ryzen-processor-windows-11-bug-fixes-190439836.html">AMD and Microsoft deployed Windows 11 updates</a> to fix some performance bugs. At the time of its testing, the i9-12900K appeared to have a commanding lead over the Ryzen 5950X in many games, like <em>Troy: A Total War Saga </em>and <em>Grid 2019</em>. But it&#39;ll be interested to see what those numbers look like now. And of course, AMD could easily come back with speedier hardware of its own early next year.</p><section data-eng-breakout="23217911933441c886aac3adc2f24e02" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/711e3b40-372f-11ec-bdfb-d6f6fb882503" alt="Intel 12th-gen CPU charts" data-uuid="c474e955-1253-308b-b537-e4330822f825"></section><p>The new 12th-gen chips are also looking towards the future, with support for up to 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and DDR5-4800 RAM. Intel&#39;s new 600-series chipset will feature PCIe 4.0 support, integrated WiFi 6E, and an updated Direct Media Interface (DMI) that&#39;ll offer &quot;double and faster bandwidth between the chipset and the processor.&quot; There&#39;s also support for up to 4 USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 ports, as well as far more USB 3.2 Gen 2 connections in general.</p><div id="e1df6fa89ad4463f84514b29648f7ade"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FOFXO9HRZG4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As you&#39;d expect, it&#39;ll cost a bit more to jump into Intel&#39;s 12th-gen chips. The Core i9-12900K will go for $589, compared to the 11900K&#39;s $539 to $549 price range. You could always save $20 or so by getting the &quot;KF&quot; chip without onboard graphics, but in general I&#39;d recommend keeping graphics in case your GPU gets fried. The more approachable Core i7-12700K, thankfully, hasn&#39;t budged from its predecessor&#39;s $409 price, while the Core i5-12600K is around $20 more than before if you want onboard graphics.</p><p>The real question for Intel is how this new hardware stacks up against what AMD and Apple have coming. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/intel-core-i9-12900hk-benchmarks-leaked-geekbench-scores-wild">Benchmark leaks suggest</a> that the i9-12900K is faster than Apple&#39;s M1 Max chip, but that&#39;s also a power-sipping laptop part. A faster, desktop-focused chip from Apple would likely leave Intel lagging behind again. Still, this uncertainty is a good thing for the PC industry as a whole. Now we&#39;ve got several companies producing powerful processors. Their attempts to one-up should ultimately be a very good thing for consumers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-core-cpu-hybrid-alder-lake-160014440.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55637a1c-d0dd-45b7-a9ed-a18a8c5a5c33</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 16:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635345820</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:43:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b34aa680-372e-11ec-bddd-727031a83618" width="1925" height="1284" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b34aa680-372e-11ec-bddd-727031a83618" width="1925" height="1284" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen CPU box]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen CPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is building a cloud gaming platform for its TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung doesn&#39;t want to cede the game streaming space to the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-173003693.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-console-cloud-gaming-test-insiders-190628810.html">Microsoft</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-introduces-an-rtx-3080-tier-for-up-to-1440-p-120-fps-gaming-130011568.html">NVIDIA</a>. <em>IGN</em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/samsung-cloud-game-platform">reports</a> Samsung has <a href="https://youtu.be/ElMqHkG26sM?t=1520">teased</a> plans for a TV-based &quot;Cloud Game Platform&quot; during its developer conference presentation.

Massive wildfires were tearing across California, eating up piles of dead trees on the mountains and razing nearby housing developments. By the end of the year, 33 people would be killed in fires across California and 2020 would go down as the largest wildfire season in the state’s modern history.</p><p>Cecil Powell was living and working in the area at the time, helping develop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-november-5-174533819.html"><em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em></a> as a senior lighting artist at Sledgehammer Games. For days on end, he and his teammates would wake up to a red-tinged world filled with ash, and then they’d sit in front of their computers and attempt to recreate the ravaged landscapes of World War II. As a lighting specialist, one of Powell’s jobs was to build the skies above Stalingrad, a bloody city scene marked by bombed buildings and raging fires.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fires — just like the ones burning across California, painting the Bay Area a Martian red.</p><p>“It was a pretty weird feeling,” Powell told Engadget. “But I remember talking to the team about it, and we were actually thinking, man, it kind of feels like war time. Like destruction.”</p><div id="9dabf988b84f4f64b482f885a46b8832"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtZWVTTyFNU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Call of Duty as a series has found years of success turning tragedy into entertainment, using the real-world horrors of war to build lifelike digital playgrounds for soldiers, snipers and spawn campers alike. To Powell and the Sledgehammer crew, the orange skies caused by the fires in California made for natural, serendipitous source material, especially since color photography wasn’t ubiquitous during WWII. Powell’s <em>Vanguard</em> reference photos were all in black and white.</p><p>The Sledgehammer team agreed that it’d be a good idea for Powell to capture images and light readings of the fiery California skies to use in the Stalingrad level, but they were concerned about his health. After all, the air looked radioactive. So, Powell bought an air-quality monitor, tested it outside and got the green light. He did some quick research and discovered that marine wind patterns in the Bay were pushing the smoke up and circulating fresh air on the ground, and the all-consuming toxic glow was simply due to light refracting through the clouds.</p><p>“As soon as I found that out, I grabbed all the camera gear that I had from work and ran out, and decided I was just going to capture this because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Powell said. “I&#39;ve never seen anything like this before and I hope I never see anything like that again, to be honest. Because, you know, it&#39;s pretty sad to think about what is causing it. And I remember while I was out there, no one was really outside walking around.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93d427d0-369e-11ec-bf53-3b47be7ae98a" alt="Cecil Powell from Sledgehammer Games in San Francisco in September 2020." data-uuid="26b6387e-ae97-3847-9d9c-b33b18614a74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cecil Powell</div></figure><p>Powell made this trek in September 2020, at the height of California’s wildfire season and in the midst of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The city was largely shut down, streets abandoned, hot smoke collecting above empty buildings. He headed toward the coast.</p><p>Powell set up his camera and captured a panorama of the sky, and also took some light readings. His girlfriend at the time came along and he asked her to document the process, for history’s sake.</p><p>When he brought the photos and readings back to Sledgehammer, “everyone was shocked at actually what it did to the lighting in the level,” Powell said. “The sky’s the most important thing lighting-wise, because for exterior lighting, it really sets the mood and the tone for levels. And when we brought it in, we&#39;re like wow, this actually looks pretty good for coming from such destruction.”</p><p>Powell’s wildfire captures are used in the Stalingrad level, one of the only theaters in the game to feature a full city destroyed by bombs and flames. The light throughout the level glows a hellish orange, just like the coasts and valleys of California last year.</p><p>“Nature to me is the best artist, you know?” Powell said. “If you can replicate that, you&#39;re pretty much winning.”</p><p>The Stalingrad level may be an automatic win for Powell, but everyone else is still going to have to shoot their way through it when <em>Vanguard </em>comes out on November 5th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-duty-vanguard-california-fires-2020-stalingrad-153029085.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96e1e51c-5b27-4f36-97fe-039d0c208662</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:40:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635344860</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:27:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93d3d9b0-369e-11ec-bfaf-2ed4acb967c0" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93d3d9b0-369e-11ec-bfaf-2ed4acb967c0" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cecil Powell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cecil Powell from Sledgehammer Games in San Francisco in September 2020.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard development process]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Music is now available on PS5]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spotify/"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> isn&#39;t the only service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ps5/">PlayStation 5</a> owners can stream music from while they&#39;re playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/returnal-ps5-save-game-suspend-cycle-photo-mode-152123500.html"><em>Returnal</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>or other games.

The <a href="https://bit.ly/3EpvWpk">Action 2</a> features a 155-degree field of view lens and 12-megapixel sensor that can capture 4K footage at up to 120 frames per second, and 240 frames per second slow-motion video at 1080p. In 2021, that’s not impressive for an action camera when you consider GoPro’s latest top-end model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">Hero 10 Black</a>, can do 5.3K at 60 frames per second and 240 frames per second at 2.7K. So what makes Action 2 into something interesting? It’s all about the form factor.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b3a5040-3737-11ec-93ed-2dd6547ef4ef" alt="DJI Action Cam 2" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>DJI’s latest device weighs just under two ounces and includes a magnetic mounting system you can use to expand the functionality of the camera. We’ve seen companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-insta360-one-r-leica-modular-action-cam.html">Insta360</a> pull off similar designs, but DJI’s execution looks particularly handy. Want to add a front-facing display to make the Action 2 into a vlogging camera? You can with a touchscreen module that adds a secondary OLED display and three additional microphones to the camera, as well as allows you to record up to 160 minutes of footage without stopping. A separate battery module extends the Action 2’s battery life from 70 minutes to three hours and adds an extra microSD slot. Other accessories allow you to mount the camera to a floating handle, a 3-in-1 extension rod and a lanyard, among other things.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other nifty features include a dedicated sensor that can help the camera produce accurate color tones in challenging lighting conditions and underwater. A feature called SnapShot allows you to turn on the device and start recording right away by holding down the power button. It also comes with all of DJI’s usual camera features, including the ability to double as a web camera and capture time-lapses.</p><p>The Action 2 is available to buy today from <a href="https://bit.ly/3EpvWpk">DJI’s website</a>. The company isn’t selling the camera on its own. Instead, you can either buy it as part of either a $399 or $519 bundle. The former comes with the aforementioned battery module while the latter includes the touchscreen accessory. Both bundles also come with a variety of mounts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dji-action-2-announcement-152328716.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1277af1f-55bc-49c6-ac9e-4484d686bb42</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:23:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635351966</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:26:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/adc3e7c0-373e-11ec-9efe-1b013bd737bd" width="1152" height="747" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/adc3e7c0-373e-11ec-9efe-1b013bd737bd" width="1152" height="747" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DJI]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Someone holds up the new DJI Action 2 camera against a dingy monotone background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI Action 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Urbanista's solar-powered headphones tease a charger-free future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>81 percent. That’s the current battery level on the pair of Urbanista’s Los Angeles headphones sitting on my desk. When I took them out of the box about a week ago, the battery level was 75 percent. Number of charges? Zero. Hours of use? Around 10. In short, with some fairly typical listening and precisely no interaction with a charging cable, the headphones have more battery life than when I received them. Impressive, though not without some caveats.</p><p>First, let’s back up a little bit. If you missed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-los-angeles-anc-headphones-solar-cells-080019327.html">the announcement</a>, the Los Angeles’ main selling point was that they came with “Powerfoyle” solar charging cells in the headband for $200. The promise was simple: even indoors, these headphones will slowly charge when not in use. Go outside? They might even maintain their level while playing music; if it’s a particularly sunny day they could even gain battery life while you listen, even with ANC on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headphones themselves have a classic Scandinavian understated look. Acoustically, they don’t offer too many surprises. That’s to say, expect a <em>slightly </em>bottom-heavy EQ experience, but overall they deliver robust clear audio that won’t tire your ears. They are Bluetooth only, though, so no wired option here. More on that in a bit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bfcaa960-3656-11ec-afff-7df78af80f13" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles headphones" data-uuid="3e060e74-5a3b-3994-804f-76e4e22b404d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, the real interest is that claim of a “nonstop audio experience.” As my intro suggests, the company’s claims are true. Or should I say, <em>can</em> be true? The headphones definitely charge themselves, even indoors, but it’s not time to throw away the (included) USB cable just yet.</p><p>If you plan on using these mostly indoors, then you will almost certainly be charging them. Even about as much as you might any other pair. That’s because while the claim about indoor charging is true, it’s barely a trickle and only really under direct light. If you place them near a window between uses you can expect a little more juice, but it’s still more of a modest top-off than a flow of free energy.</p><p>This I can say with relative confidence thanks to the companion app which kindly shows you power coming in versus power being used with a fancy little circular chart. When the photons are abundant, the chart turns a pale green and a reassuring “up” arrow lets you know the headphones are gaining power. Enter the shadows, however, and things turn red to let you know you’re draining the battery. You can even see the amount of energy coming in or being used at any one time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4536b6e0-3650-11ec-afd8-3025bc6cb94d" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones." data-uuid="94113c03-9705-31a3-b195-e043dca48d89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With this info we can start to get an idea of how effectively the solar charging works. For example, just by turning the headphones on they will use about 2.6mA to maintain a connection to a phone. Play music, and this goes up to around 9mA. Add on either ANC or Ambient mode and this can creep up to around 13-15mA. Those are our numbers to “beat.”</p><p>In my testing, when laid flat on a table in a room without direct sunlight or any lights on during the day, they won’t charge at all. If I placed them <em>directly </em>under a lamp or bulb you might get between 0.2 and 1mA of charge. Place them near a window during the day and this can climb to about 3mA. Open that window and it’ll increase to maybe 4mA (indirect sunlight). So far, you’re only really slowing down their battery use by a tiny amount.</p><p>As I already hinted at, things get a lot more interesting once you head outside. Walking in the shade in the street you can expect about 3-5mA of input. Again, you’re still in net loss. Head out directly into the sun, however, and everything springs to life. I was frequently able to achieve 24mA of “gain” while listening to music with ANC (for around 8-10mA of drain).</p><p>The short version is… that the Urbanistas will charge when there’s ambient light. A bit. But take them outside (and with good sunshine) and they will even charge while in use. All this to say that, if I used these like I do any other wireless headphones, I would expect the solar charging to maybe add a few hours to their battery life. If I only used them outdoors, they would live forever.</p><p>This is all good news though. What Urbanista has done here is set a benchmark. JBL <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-jbl-reflect-eternal-solar-powered-headphones.html">tried something similar</a>, but <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/jbl-reflect-eternal-self-charging-headphones/#/">that project</a> was tabled due to COVID travel restrictions making them unviable. Urbanista is actually shipping its version and it can only get better from here.</p><p>Perhaps the most understated achievement here is that the headphones don’t <em>look</em> like they have a solar panel attached. At least if you opt for the black pair. The cells in the head strap more or less blend into the design of the Los Angeles, just with the Powerfoyle logo on them (also in black so it’s fairly subtle). The headphones are also available in “sand gold” which is more of a cream/mushroom color. On those, the solar strip is painfully obvious but done in such a way it could be passed off as a style choice.</p><p>There are some other minor notes to consider. Most notably, for me, the volume. Urbanista says the pair I received for review are set at about 2dB below what the retail model will offer. But using them with an iPhone I have to almost always have them on full volume if I want to be immersed in a song. I found myself frequently mashing the volume button in vain when a banger came on and I wanted to get truly lost in sound but there was never anywhere left to go. I listen to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR8fG8ccqAA&amp;t=135s">a lot of bangers</a>.</p><p>For people that don’t assault their ears, the volume is probably fine. It’s not hugely lower than, say, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-20-aiaiai-tma-2-hd-modular-headphones-hands-on.html">AiAiAi TMA-2s</a> I use. Connect things to a computer and, well, you can go a bit louder, so some of this, the company suggests, is down to your device’s chipset and regional limitations.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3da3edc0-365b-11ec-975d-7b475a19e3c5" alt="Urbanista Los Angeles headphones." data-uuid="77aa5e34-a8d2-3047-9c36-373d33f060af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If there was a second bugbear, it’d be the buttons. The Los Angeles has three buttons on the right side for volume/play/pause and skipping tracks and power. Then there’s a lone button on the other side for switching between ANC, Ambient mode and “default” mode or activating your phone’s assistant. The problem is, the buttons on the right side — i.e. the ones you interact with most — are tiny and very close together. This means that swift volume changes are difficult. Instead, you have to sort of fondle around to “count” the buttons with your finger to find the first or third one.</p><p>I do also wish there was the option to use them with a 3.5mm cable. Not only does that give you an option for whenever the battery does run out (or you’re in an Airplane mode situation) it would ameliorate some of my volume woes for when I really do need to feel a drop right to the core of my amygdala. (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html">DACs are wonderful things</a>.)</p><p>As for other small positives, the app is a nice touch and opens up the door for possible firmware updates or new features. It was a little flakey in connecting sometimes. Or rather, once it had been connected and then left idle, I’d sometimes have to restart it, but for the amount of time you need it it’s not a major pain to swipe it away and open it again.</p><p>There’s also auto-pause when you take the headphones off. This is a subtle but welcome addition that gives things a slightly more premium feel.</p><p>All in all, the Los Angeles’ features and pricepoint come together to make a pleasing experience. The sound is very capable without being too aggressive in the lower frequencies. The battery life is obviously a selling point if you frequently find yourself without gas while on the go. And the small touches like Ambient mode/ANC, auto pause and so on just round them out to be a little more comprehensive than other options in this price range. If they were a smidge louder and had a 3.5mm port then these would be a solid pick for me, but even without those features, it’s hard not to admire what Urbanista has done here for $200.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urbanistas-solar-power-los-angeles-headphones-review-152013319.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb73c2d8-828b-4093-94ae-347c3e3add57</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:20:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635344849</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:27:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cfa472a0-364f-11ec-bf1f-e49ca3b58671" width="3840" height="2225" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cfa472a0-364f-11ec-bf1f-e49ca3b58671" width="3840" height="2225" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urbanista Los Angeles solar-charging headphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft details plans to slash water use at its data centers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of the UN&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cop26/"><ins>COP26</ins></a> climate change conference, which starts on Sunday, Microsoft has revealed more details about its plans to make its data centers greener. Among those is a goal of reducing the amount of water its data centers use by 95 percent by 2024 — around 5.7 billion liters each year.</p><p>Data centers often use water to keep servers cool. Microsoft has researched server performance at higher temperatures and found that it&#39;s able to &quot;create higher set points for a variety of different climates for when water-based, evaporative cooling is necessary to preserve server performance and reliability,&quot; as Noelle Walsh, Microsoft&#39;s corporate vice president of cloud ops and innovation <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/27/supporting-our-customers-on-the-path-to-net-zero-the-microsoft-cloud-and-decarbonization/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says this project, which it expects to be fully implemented by 2024, could completely eliminate the need to use water for cooling in locations such as Amsterdam, Dublin, Virginia and Chicago. It may reduce water use in desert data center locations (like Arizona) by up to 60 percent.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft continuing its research into liquid immersion cooling to reduce its dependency on water. The company says that, this year, it became the first cloud services provider to run &quot;two-phase liquid immersion cooling in a production environment.&quot; It&#39;s been looking into overclocking as well and found liquid cooling can increase performance of some chipsets by 20 percent.</p><p>&quot;Because of the efficiencies in both power and cooling that liquid cooling affords us, it unlocks new potential for datacenter rack design,&quot; Walsh wrote. &quot;In short, liquid cooling paves the way for more densely packed servers in smaller spaces, meaning increased capacity per square foot in a datacenter — or the ability to create smaller datacenters in more strategic locations in the future. This adds to the benefits of waterless cooling design.&quot;</p><p>Last September, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-water-positive-2030-164019192.html"><ins>announced plans</ins></a> to become &quot;water positive&quot; (i.e. to replenish more water than it uses) by 2030, and these data center efforts will be a key part of that goal. It also aims to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-carbon-negative-2030-steps-093047774.html"><ins>carbon negative</ins></a> by the end of the decade by removing more carbon than it emits. By 2050, the company plans to remove more carbon from the atmosphere than it has generated since it was founded in 1975.</p><p>In addition, Microsoft says it&#39;s designing data centers with local ecosystems in mind &quot;to renew and revitalize the surrounding area so that we can restore and create a pathway to provide regenerative value for the local community and environment.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s attempting to use more environmentally friendly processes in designing and building data centers to reduce its carbon footprint. The aim is to use building materials that reduce &quot;embodied carbon,&quot; or emissions linked to materials and construction during a building&#39;s life cycle. Concrete and steel are said to be major contributors of such emissions. Microsoft says it has found ways of reducing embodied carbon from those materials by up to 60 percent.</p><p>Elsewhere, the company has <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/10/27/advancing-a-net-zero-future-ahead-of-cop26-new-carbon-accounting-tools-available-with-the-microsoft-cloud-for-sustainability-now-in-public-preview/"><ins>opened up</ins></a> a public preview of a tool called <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sustainability"><ins>Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability</ins></a> to help companies and other organizations record and report their carbon emissions.

The platform has been gradually expanding access to the feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-link-stickers-160612810.html"><ins>over the last several months</ins></a>, and now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram/"><ins>Instagram</ins></a> says it&#39;s rolling out the option to just about everyone.</p><p>It works in a similar way to any other sticker in Stories. Tap the sticker icon at the top of the screen, scroll down to or search for the link option, select it, paste in the URL and position the sticker on your photo or video. Instagram says it&#39;s working on options for users to customize the sticker and provide more context to viewers about the page it leads to.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The &quot;swipe up&quot; link function that the sticker replaces was only available to verified accounts or those with at least 10,000 followers. But soon enough, almost all users will be able to add links to their Stories.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that not every single person will be able to use the link sticker. New accounts and those that often share misinformation and hate speech will be blocked from using the feature, as will those who post other content that goes against the community guidelines. Instagram says that this is part of its efforts to limit harmful content on the platform.</p><p>However, some users say they lost access to the sticker unfairly. <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/losing-link-sticker-instagram"><em><ins>BuzzFeed News</ins></em></a> reported last week, for instance, that Instagram prevented one creator from using the sticker after they shared a photo of kids from the waist up in a bath that was pulled for “nudity or sexual activity.” Instagram said it would look into claims of users being mistakenly told they won&#39;t be able to use link stickers anymore.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-link-stickers-roll-out-150024795.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9877f789-ef8c-4f2d-b42e-42899c155de0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635342418</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T13:47:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a728a100-3728-11ec-bc6e-37288812ac46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a728a100-3728-11ec-bc6e-37288812ac46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A series of screenshots showing how to add Link Stickers in Instagram Stories]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Link Stickers in Instagram Stories]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Streamlabs says Facebook Gaming views have overtaken YouTube Gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the first time ever, people recently spent more time on Facebook Gaming than YouTube Gaming watching their favorite streamers. That’s according to Streamlabs, which published its <a href="https://medium.com/@ethan.may/8b6ceb6a9c32">Q3 2021 Live Streaming Industry Report</a> on Wednesday.</p><p>The company says viewers watched 1.29 billion hours of content on Facebook Gaming between August and September, representing a 9.2 percent increase from the previous quarter. By contrast, the amount of content people watched on YouTube Gaming went from 1.294 billion hours in Q2 2021 to 1.13 billion hours in the most recent three-month period. In terms of viewership, Google’s platform has seen a steady decline since it hit a peak at the end of last year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube’s struggles are surprising considering the company recently spent big to secure talent like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html"><ins>DrLupo</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html"><ins>TimTheTatman</ins></a>. Steamlabs attributes the milestone to Facebook Gaming’s international popularity, in addition to the recent rollout of features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gaming-co-streaming-announcement-170034516.html"><ins>co-streaming</ins></a>. Whether Facebook can continue to top YouTube is hard to say. Over the same timeframe, the platform saw a decline in both total hours streamed and unique channels. Those stand at 17.1 million and 440,000 currently, representing declines of 17.8 percent and 48 percent from the previous quarter. For what it’s worth, Steamlabs predicts the company is on the right path.</p><p>As for Twitch, it ran into its own set of problems. People watched 5.79 billion hours of content last quarter. Obviously, that’s more than Facebook and YouTube combined, but it’s also a 11 percent decrease from the viewership numbers it saw in Q2 2021. What’s more, the above number represents a year-over-year decline of 22 percent. At the same time, Twitch saw, for the first time ever, a year-over-year decline in unique channels, with that number decreasing from 10.6 million in Q3 2020 to 10.4 million in Q3 2021.   Still, with a 70 percent share of the market in terms of hours watched, Twitch is the dominant platform in the space, and that’s unlikely to change anytime soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-q3-2021-live-streaming-industry-report-150022643.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">993cf5c9-bb9f-4957-9c83-93e149e967d4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635269499</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T17:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fba23c30-3680-11ec-8db7-100b3d9358aa" width="4893" height="3262" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fba23c30-3680-11ec-8db7-100b3d9358aa" width="4893" height="3262" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A display for Facebook Gaming is shown during opening day of E3, the annual video games expo revealing the latest in gaming software and hardware in Los Angeles, California, U.S., June 11, 2019.
