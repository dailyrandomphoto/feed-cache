All the versions are all-black rather than grey, so they may appeal to musicians who want that aesthetic or the exclusivity of a limited edition model.</p><p>As a reminder, the MiniBrute 2 is a monophonic synth that&#39;s semi-modular in that it has a decent-sized patchbay for rerouting the synth&#39;s signal, but it can also make sounds right out of the box. Other features include a pair of VCOs, two LFOs and the 25-note, velocity-sensitive keyboard with aftertouch and dual-oscillator Brute Voice. The MiniBrute 2s lacks the keyboard but offers a 64-step sequencer for &quot;classic synth workflow and punchy Brute character.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/41138010-7477-11ec-9d7f-db093262c236" style="height:1490;width:2000;" alt="Arturia unveils &#39;Noir&#39; editions of its popular mid-tier MiniBrute synths" data-uuid="17d5b66a-238e-375a-97ad-022abbd55aa5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>The DrumBrute Impact, meanwhile, is Arturia&#39;s entry level 10-voice analog drum machine.

Most recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leica-m10r-rangefinder-40-megapixel-130035234.html">the M10-R added a 40-megapixel sensor</a> to the to the camera, a big step up over the 24-megapixel one found in the original M10. But today, Leica is ready to leave the M10 lineup behind and move to a totally new camera, the Leica M11.</p><p>Well, “totally new” might be a stretch. It’ll look familiar to anyone who has seen Leica’s famous lineup of rangefinder cameras before, and it still uses Leica’s M mount for lenses, but the company has put in enough new features to justify giving it a new name. First and foremost is a new 60-megapixel full-frame sensor, making this camera a huge upgrade for anyone who might have purchased the original M10 back in 2017. The so-called “triple resolution” sensor can shoot at either 60, 36 or 18 megapixels in DNG RAW or JPG. Notably, Leica says it&#39;ll shoot using the full sensor area when shooting at a lower resolution, rather than cropping the image down. But these images might loose some sharpness because of pixel binning or line skipping that occurs when using the full sensor to shoot at a lower resolution. .</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shooting at lower resolution, though, will naturally save storage space and also offer extended burst shooting. The ISO on this camera ranges from 64 all the way to 50,000, a stop more than the 100-50,000 range offered on the M10 series.  The ISO on this camera goes from 64 all the way to 50,000, a stop more than the 100-50,000 range offered on the M10 series.</p><p>Speaking of storage, the M11 has 64GB of onboard storage, which lets photographers storage images both on the internal memory as well as an SD memory card. Leica also redesigned the bottom plate of the camera to provide quicker access to the SD cart slot and battery. There’s also a USB-C port right in the bottom of the camera, which makes charging the battery and transferring pictures to a computer a bit easier. That’s a fairly common feature these days, but it’s still a welcome addition to the M11. Leica also says that the M11’s 1,800mAh battery stores 64 percent more power than the battery on older models</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/bb10aab0-73d6-11ec-96fd-d0711cf75dba" alt="Leica M11 transferring photos to a smartphone." data-uuid="0572b8ac-7ab1-33e2-963d-94a014dc578b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Leica</div></figure><p>As with the M10 series, the M11 uses Leica’s optical rangefinder and manual focus only. But the 3-inch back screen, which you can also use as a viewfinder, has 2,332,800 pixels, more than double the 1,036,800 pixels on the M10. In another concession to modern technology, the M11 has both a mechanical and an electronic shutter.&nbsp;</p><p>The standard mechanical option can shoot at speeds up to 1/4000th of a second, while the electronic shutter goes up to a whopping 1/16,000 of a second. Perhaps most significantly, the electronic shutter will be totally silent, something that street photographers should appreciate. The M10-R had an “extra silent” mechanical shutter, but you can’t beat a motionless electronic shutter if you need perfectly quiet operation.</p><p>Leica is offering two models: an all-black M11 and a black and silver option. The latter uses a brass top plate and as such weighs in at 640 grams, 100 grams more than the all-black models. To save weight, that camera has an aluminum top with a scratch-resistant coating. Regardless of which finish you prefer, the M11 is wildly expensive, in keeping with Leica tradition. It costs $8,995 without a lens, the same price as the M10-R.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the numerous improvements here, it’s nice that Leica didn’t increase the price further, but — as we said when we checked out the M10-R — Leica rangefinders are as much a status symbol as they are a photography tool. We said the M10-R was the king of that category in 2020, but now it seems the M11 has taken the throne. The M11 is available to order now.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/leica-m11-rangefinder-digital-camera-price-specs-release-date-140032032.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93c1f35a-08ef-42e3-98a2-abacb2b687f0</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642082975</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T14:09:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4dcb3d40-747a-11ec-b712-3e259b345865" width="2817" height="1726" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4dcb3d40-747a-11ec-b712-3e259b345865" width="2817" height="1726" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Leica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The M11 rangefinder digital camera.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Leica M11 rangefinder digital camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's updated iCloud Private Relay notice clarifies why it might not work for some users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is set to slightly alter the wording on its notice for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/applenot-release-private-relay-china-090524919.html">iCloud Private Relay</a> error that switched off the VPN-like feature for some users. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the tech giant will update its note for users, clarifying that their carriers aren&#39;t <em>always</em> to blame for the issue. After a previous iOS 15.2 update, some users found that they couldn&#39;t use Private Relay while on a cellular network. Private Relay ensures that, as long as the user is on Safari, not even Apple can see their activities.&nbsp;</p><p>The original notice puts the blame solely on mobile carriers:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan.

With ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>T-Mobile, however, denied that it was responsible for the error happening to its subscribers&#39; phones. It told <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> Mark Gurman in a <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248">statement</a> that it identified a problem with the iOS 15.2 update that toggled off the feature by default. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/apple-icloud-private-relay-ios-15-2/?Bibblio_source=true">denied</a> that its update rolled out with changes to Private Relay, as one would expect: &quot;No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,&quot; a spokesperson said.</p><p>Whatever the real reason is for the feature being switched off, fixing the problem could be as simple as toggling some settings back on. The updated notice that rolled out with iOS 15.3 beta now says:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings.

According to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/12/africa/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-midnight-government-official-says-2022-01-12/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/81764d61-6a3a-4914-b6d6-69d56d256b2a"><em>The Financial Times</em></a>, Nigeria has decided to lift the ban after Twitter agreed to open a local office.</p><p>Twitter also had to agree to meet other conditions set by the government, including &quot;managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.&quot; The social network has to pay domestic taxes, as well, and to appoint a representative in the country who&#39;ll be in charge of engaging with local authorities.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;ll recall, Nigeria originally suspended Twitter in June 2021 after the website removed a tweet made by President Muhammadu Buhari who used the platform to threaten citizens following attacks on government buildings.

Until now, most devices for this style of mixing have either been the classic turntables and mixer combo, or pricey modular units. Today, Pioneer DJ announces its new DDJ-REV controller series focused on the battle DJ’s style of mixing and aimed at both novices and pros alike. The new entry-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV1-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV1</a> ($259) and the pro-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-rev7/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN-US&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV7-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV7</a> ($1,899) are both Serato DJ compatible and offer an adjusted layout for fans of the sideways turntable and the Pioneer DJM-S series of mixers.</p><p>Newcomers interested in this style of DJing can get a taste of what’s to come, with a few useful flourishes for the livestreaming generation. The 2-channel DDJ-REV1 controller runs Serato DJ Lite and includes a 14-day trial of Serato DJ Pro. It’s bus-powered and has slightly larger jog wheels than prior models in this price range. It also includes a mic input that blends into the master so you can get chatty during livestreams without extra gear - a perk in this level of product. Along with the mic, the only other input is the USB port, and you only get a single RCA master output.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although pint-sized, the layout echoes a classic battle DJ’s choice with platters at the bottom and a horizontal pitch slider up top. A sideways turntable allowed easier scratching without the tonearm getting in the way, which resulted in an unusual placement for the pitch control. It seems that some have gotten used to it and this type of controller layout caters to that familiarity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c5a1a040-7329-11ec-bf9e-13ce4142c2c8" alt="Pioneer DJ / Serato DJ - DDJ-REV1 controller" data-uuid="2917ed12-5120-36ea-9be7-58a964cea0c8"><figcaption>The DDJ-REV1 controller.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pioneer DJ</div></figure><p>The central mixing panel also borrows from the popular Pioneer DJM-S series, with performance pads in the middle and lockable FX toggles. There’s a Scratch Bank to store your choice of audio clips and also a Tracking Scratch feature. This saves you having to get back to a scratchable cue point by doing it for you when you remove your hands from the ridged capacitive jog wheel or spin it back.</p><p>If you have more seasoned skills and/or more money to spend, the 2-channel DDJ-REV7 is a better fit. This higher-end model includes 7-inch motorized jog wheels with vinyl-mimicking top plates and adjustable torque for a classic turntable feel. Each side also includes a 3.5-inch on-jog display where you can see waveforms and other data, or switch to a Serato virtual deck view, song artwork or your own logo with easy-to-see omnidirectional viewing.</p><p>As with the economy model, the DDJ-REV7 mimics a classic cut and scratch layout with the DJM-S styled central mixer, performance pads and FX toggle. Those jog wheels are along the front edge with the pitch slider on the top. Relevant control buttons live in between those, somewhat reminiscent of the Pioneer CDJ series layout.</p><p>Other highlights for the DDJ-REV7 are onboard scratch samples, a Maglev Fader Pro and 22 built-in Beat FX. If you want to flank your controller with turntables or CDJs, you’re in luck since there are line and phono inputs on each channel. Plan to swap with another DJ during live sets? The dual USB ports will make life easier. You&#39;ll need a computer for most things, since there&#39;s no thumb drive or SD Card slot. It <em>seems</em> you can store full tracks in the on-board scratch bank along with clips, but that doesn&#39;t seem like a complete solution.

The list of documents includes everything from the original class action complaint to notices of the settlement to different types of class members. It also includes information on how to get in contact with the settlement administrator.</p><p>A group Apple employees sued the company in 2013 for not paying them for the time it took to check their bags during their shifts or when they&#39;re leaving for work, which took between five to 20 minutes. They claimed Apple was violating California law by doing so. Apple said bag checks were necessary to ensure workers weren&#39;t leaving with stolen goods or trade secrets and tried to argue in court that those who didn&#39;t like the policy could simply not bring their bags or their iPhones to work. The company stopped searching employees&#39; bags in 2015.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While a district court originally tossed the lawsuit, it went to the California Supreme Court on appeal, wherein the judge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html">sided</a> with the plaintiffs. As previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/apple-to-pay-30-million-over-security-checks-for-store-workers?sref=10lNAhZ9">revealed</a> in a court filing, the lawsuit covers 14,683 workers in 52 Apple Stores in California who were subjected to bag checks from July 25th, 2009 until August 10th, 2015.

Specifically, Angela Hession, Twitch’s vice president of global trust and safety, says the company will update its user reporting and appeals process.&nbsp;</p><p>It also plans to upgrade its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-suspicious-user-detection-announcement-000510859.html"><ins>Suspicious User Detection</ins></a> feature. The AI tool, which the company launched at the end of last year, automatically flags individuals it believes may be repeat ban dodgers. In 2022, Twitch has updates planned around how streamers can use information from that tool. As the company has indicated previously, it also plans to update its sexual content policy to clarify various aspects of it. Twitch simultaneously intends to share more and “better” educational content across its safety center and other areas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitch spent much of the latter half of 2021 trying to stop automated &quot;hate raid&quot; harassment campaigns. The attacks saw malicious individuals use thousands of bots to spam channels with hateful language, and they frequently targeted streamers from marginalized communities. In September, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sues-hate-raiders-cruzzcontrol-and-creatine-overdose-184439305.html">sued</a> CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, two of the more prolific individuals involved in those campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’ll likely never be able to eliminate [hate raids] entirely,&quot; Hession said. However, she claims Twitch  &quot;significantly&quot; cut down on the number of bots on its platform through some of its actions in 2021. In 2022, it looks to continue that work through the improvements it announced today.&nbsp;</p><p>If the company’s safety roadmap feels light on details, Hession says that’s out of necessity. “The honest and unfortunate reality is that we can&#39;t always be specific because bad actors can and have used that transparency to attempt to thwart our efforts,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the executive acknowledged Twitch needs to do a better job of communicating what it’s doing to make people feel safe on its platform. It’s easy to see why the company would say that. When it felt like the hate raids that were occurring on Twitch couldn’t get any worse, many creators banded together to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html"><ins>protest</ins></a> the lack of action they saw from the company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bd42848-2e68-4375-90d4-d4a228426c85</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:29:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642030259</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:59:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man works at a computer at the offices of Twitch Interactive Inc, a social video platform and gaming community owned by Amazon, in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 6, 2017.

Platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-policy-204452958.html">Twitter</a> have adopted policies in an effort to curtail rampant false claims, but some don&#39;t have rules in place. A group of 270 doctors, nurses, scientists and educators <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/">have sent an open letter to Spotify</a> following a recent episode of <em>The</em><em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calling for the streaming service to adopt a clear policy and to fulfill its &quot;responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>On the December 31st episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who says he&#39;s one of the creators of mRNA technology. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/">unclear</a> whether that&#39;s true. During the chat, Malone made baseless claims about COVID-19, including the idea that &quot;mass formation psychosis&quot; led people to believe the vaccines were effective and the notion that President Biden had withheld data that supported ivermectin as a valid treatment. The episode quickly went viral among both critics and fans as Rogan averages over 10 million listeners per episode. YouTube <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-rogan-podcast-youtube-robert-malone-b1986008.html">removed a video of the interview</a> and Malone was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/31/prominant-virologist-kicked-off-twitter-for-spreading-anti-vaxx-video-15844655/">banned from Twitter</a> for violations of the platform&#39;s COVID-19 misinformation policy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,&quot; <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">the letter explains</a>. &quot;[The episode] is not the only transgression to occur on the Spotify platform, but a relevant example of the platform’s failure to mitigate the damage it is causing.&quot;</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"><em>The Verge reported</em></a> that Spotify was okay with a Rogan episode on which he encouraged 21-year-olds to not get vaccinated. A company source indicated the message wasn&#39;t &quot;outwardly anti-vaccine&quot; and he didn&#39;t &quot;make a call to action,&quot; <em>The Verge&#39;s </em>Ashley Carman wrote at the time. Spotify has taken down more explicit examples of vaccine misinformation, including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ian-brown-says-spotify-have-taken-down-his-anti-lockdown-song-little-seed-big-tree-2899613">a song from musician Ian Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/pete-evans-spotify-ban-2021-1">a podcast from Pete Evans</a>. The company has said in the past that it &quot;prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.&quot; And that when something violates those guidelines, it is removed.</p><p>However, as this open letter points out, Spotify doesn&#39;t have an official misinformation policy like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others. The group is asking for the platform to do just that, rather than to directly take action against Rogan or remove the episode in question. They want the company to create rules that would hold podcast creators accountable for the content of their shows.</p><p>Spotify paid a reported $100 million to lock down <em>The Joe Rogan Experience </em>as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">an exclusive podcast</a> in 2020. The show was the most popular on the platform in 2021, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html">both in the US and globally</a>. When Rogan faced criticism over his choice of guests, including another example of pandemic misinformation in an episode with Alex Jones, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ceo-editorial-responsibility-podcasts-040340113.html">didn&#39;t have editorial responsibility</a> over podcasts.</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of really well-paid rappers on Spotify too, that make tens of millions of dollars, if not more, each year from Spotify.&quot; <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-talks-future-of-podcasts-93925d11-d002-478b-81fb-c371743f6c3c.html">Ek told Axios</a><em>.</em> &quot;And we don&#39;t dictate what they&#39;re putting in their songs, either.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify didn&#39;t respond to Engadget&#39;s request for comment on both the open letter and the company&#39;s misinformation policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-health-misinformation-covid-19-open-letter-215921304.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f8ba7181-ef64-4b91-90a7-f5f1932ab7ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:59:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642026567</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T22:29:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carmen Mandato via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 10: Joe Rogan introduces fighters during the UFC 269 ceremonial weigh-in  at MGM Grand Garden Arena on December 10, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dolby Atmos playback is automatic with recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">AirPods</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">Beats</a> earphones, but you can manually enable the format for Android or compatible third-party audio gear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal comes just days after David Bowie&#39;s estate made later albums available on a trio of services in Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio format, and shows how spatial audio has become a significant battleground. Streaming providers clearly hope you&#39;ll subscribe to hear your favorite stars in a new way, but Apple, Sony and others also benefit by spurring sales of earbuds and other hardware. Don&#39;t be surprised if you see more (and possibly larger) exclusives surface in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/j-cole-spatial-audio-apple-music-212924734.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e4aa972-818f-4bb6-aab4-38dcb0564059</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642022965</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b5edfd90-73e9-11ec-9cf7-44877206f308" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b5edfd90-73e9-11ec-9cf7-44877206f308" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tim Mosenfelder via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA - OCTOBER 20: J.

We recently highlighted the Wyze Cam V3 as our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html"><ins>favorite overall home security camera</ins></a>, thanks to its low price and handy selection of features. Although a subscription isn&#39;t totally necessary for the company&#39;s cameras, it does offer extra utility. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wyze/"><ins>Wyze</ins></a> is opening up a new subscription tier to everyone.</p><p>The <a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"><ins>Cam Plus Lite plan</ins></a> includes AI-powered Person Detection (instead of motion detection) and 12-second event recordings. Here&#39;s the twist: it&#39;s a pay-what-you-want plan, so you&#39;ll have access to those features without having to pay a monthly or annual fee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The existing Cam Plus plan costs $2 per month or $15 per year. It supports back-to-back event recordings (instead of one every five minutes). Other features include full-length video recording for as long as motion is detected, and package, vehicle and pet detection.</p><p>Until now, Wyze cameras have captured 12-second clips as often as every five minutes when they detect an event, and those recordings are stored for up to 14 days. Wyze is moving that feature to its subscriptions, though, you&#39;ll need to opt in to the Cam Plus or Cam Plus Lite plan to keep using cloud recordings.</p><p>Wyze says it&#39;s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/wyze-cam-plus-lite-subscription/">pairing</a> cloud recordings with the AI-powered Person Detection feature in the Cam Plus Lite plan to make them more useful and cut down on unnecessary notifications that might be triggered by a clip of, say, an insect flying in front of the camera. The company believes this approach will improve the overall experience, though it said it will incur significant cloud costs as a result. As such, while it won&#39;t make users pay for those features, it&#39;s hoping they&#39;ll contribute what they can to help cover the costs for everyone.</p><p>If you don&#39;t <a href="https://services.wyze.com/purchase/type/person-detection">opt in</a> to Cam Plus Lite, your cameras will store thumbnails of what they detect, rather than video. You&#39;ll still be able to sign up for Cam Plus Lite at any time.</p><p>Wyze is making some changes to the local storage options too. It will support microSDXC cards with more than 32GB of storage. That feature&#39;s available on Wyze Cam v3 now, and it&#39;s coming to the company&#39;s other cameras as part of their next firmware update. By the middle of February, Wyze will roll out 30-second rewind and skp forward buttons to help users zip through footage stored on a microSD card faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wyze-cam-plus-lite-plan-a-pay-what-you-want-security-camera-211502333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02592e1c-4b54-446f-a2f2-07c1a90c3807</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:15:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642021513</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T21:05:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wyze]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FCC proposes stricter requirements for reporting data breaches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is the next US regulator hoping to hold companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-rules-that-health-apps-must-notify-consumers-if-their-data-is-breached-114043312.html">more accountable for data breaches</a>. Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements">shared</a> a rulemaking proposal that would introduce stricter requirements for data breach reporting. Most notably, the new rules would require notifications for customers affected by &quot;inadvertent&quot; breaches — companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html">leave data exposed</a> would have to be just as communicative as victims of cyberattacks.</p><p>The requirements would also scrap a mandatory one-week waiting period for notifying customers.

There&#39;s no guarantee the Commission will greenlight the new requirements. It won&#39;t be surprising if the rulemaking moves forward, however. While companies are now more likely to disclose breaches, there have been multiple high-profile incidents where those firms took too long to alert customers or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-ny-attorney-general-sues-dunkin-cyberattacks.html">didn&#39;t notify them at all</a>.

The patch addresses a vulnerability found within the company’s HomeKit protocol for connecting disparate smart home devices. The bug allowed malicious individuals to force an iPhone or iPad to repeatedly crash and freeze by changing the name of a HomeKit-compatible device to include more than 500,000 characters. Since iOS backs up HomeKit device names to iCloud, it was possible for iOS users to get stuck in an endless loop of crashes.</p><p>Security researcher <a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html">Trevor Spiniolas</a> discovered the vulnerability and publicly disclosed it on January 1st. According to Spiniolas, he informed Apple of the bug back in August. The company had reportedly planned to address the vulnerability before the end of 2021 but later delayed a fix to early 2022. “I believe this bug is being handled inappropriately as it poses a serious risk to users and many months have passed without a comprehensive fix,” Spiniolas said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spiniolas found that the vulnerability is present within Apple’s mobile operating system as far back as iOS 14.7, but said he believes it exists in all versions of iOS 14.

However, Apple also fared particularly well this year — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a> received five nominations, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-show-season-2-teaser-apple-tv-plus-141241307.html"><em>The Morning Show</em></a> racked up four. <em>Coda</em> and the not-quite-released <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em> also burnished Apple&#39;s image.</p><p>Other services also had their due. Amazon had success with titles like <em>Being the Ricardos</em> and <em>The Tender Bar</em>, while Disney&#39;s empire made its presence felt with nominations for <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> and Disney+ series like <em>Loki</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix also broke a cultural boundary — <em>Squid Game</em><a href="https://twitter.com/squidgame/status/1481300075989303297">is the first</a> non-English series to receive a SAG nomination, not to mention the first Korean series. This isn&#39;t completely surprising given Netflix&#39;s eagerness to produce worldwide blockbusters, but it&#39;s notable given how difficult it has been for foreign releases to crack these awards.</p><p>Theater- and TV-first material still has a significant presence in SAG&#39;s nominations. Nonetheless, it&#39;s evident the partial return to normalcy in entertainment only had a limited effect — streamed shows are still thriving in the current awards landscape.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sag-awards-2022-nomintions-netflix-apple-amazon-191041019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">281ca81b-3d48-4f0a-918b-e9b2595db6df</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 19:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642014642</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T19:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noh Juhan/Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds bitmoji reactions and threaded replies to chats]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/snapchat"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> is ringing in the new year with a bunch of new features.

On Wednesday, the White House said it would allocate billions toward projects that lead to the construction of more wind, solar and geothermal energy across the country.</p><p>Specifically, the administration announced it’s moving forward with the lease of six commercial areas off the coasts of New York and New Jersey for use in wind farm projects. On offer is more than 488,000 acres of ocean seafloor for the winning bidders to build an estimated 5.6 and 7 gigawatts of clean power generation. As part of the bidding process, the White House says it will incentivize participants to support labor jobs and to source turbine components from American manufacturers. The New York Bight development is one of the primary pillars of the Biden administration’s plan to build out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-off-shore-wind-plan-204820118.html">30 gigawatts of offshore wind production by 2030</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another significant facet of today’s announcement is the “Building a Better Grid” initiative. Pulling from the $65 billion Congress set aside for power grid upgrades when it passed President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, the initiative earmarks $2.5 billion toward funding the installation of new transmission lines. It’s putting another $3 billion toward an expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, which supports projects that increase the capacity and flexibility of existing electrical infrastructure.</p><p>The administration notes it will also allocate $10 billion in grants to states, tribes and utility companies to help those groups strengthen their local transmission lines. Taken together, the investments will help modernize the country’s power grid, making it easier to transport renewable energy from remote generation sites to where it’s needed most. It will also harden the power grid against the kind of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-cold-snap-outage-193054181.html">extreme weather events</a> that have become more commonplace as the effects of climate change have worsened.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees the White House putting forward meaningful climate policy, but if the Biden administration is to have a chance of meeting the president’s ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-10/how-joe-biden-s-2035-green-energy-grid-could-work">decarbonizing the country’s power grid by 2035</a>, it will need to bypass the legislative gridlock that has left the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/">Build Better Back Framework</a> in limbo. Much of that will depend on whether the White House can convince Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support the approximately $1.75 trillion climate and social spending bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-climate-change-policy-181033816.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ee13fdb-3f9b-49e6-9407-165c9e47ee26</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 18:10:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642013684</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:55:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZHOUSHAN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 24, 2021 - An aerial photo taken on November 24, 2021 shows wind turbines rotating under sea breeze at a wind farm in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, China.

Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple and Acer held on to their respective top-five positions in shipments, but Apple and Acer were the shining stars after growing deliveries over 20 percent compared to 2020. Frontrunners Lenovo and HP had the slowest growth of the leaders in 2021, and saw their shipments fall in the very last quarter where other rivals grew. Their size didn&#39;t help them capitalize on expanded demand for computers, to put it another way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also seems likely that 2022 will be similarly bright.

Instead, HP said it was using a &quot;globally diverse&quot; supply network to stay &quot;agile and adaptable&quot; in the midst of chip shortages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The printer trouble illustrates one of the common complaints about digital rights management (DRM) and other copy protection systems: they create trouble the moment their designers can&#39;t offer full support. Just ask people who bought music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-04-23-microsoft-turns-the-drm-screw-on-msn-music-owners.html">tied to Microsoft&#39;s PlaysForSure</a>, for example. It&#39;s doubtful Canon, HP or others will drop their DRM chips any time soon, but this incident won&#39;t exactly help their case.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12 1:05PM ET:</strong> Canon told Engadget its focus was to &quot;limit possible disruption&quot; to customers, and that included shipping toner cartridges without the anti-knockoff chips. The company stressed there was no shortage of the cartridges themselves — American customers still had a &quot;continuous supply.&quot; You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p><em>While the global shortage of semiconductor components continues to affect many industries, it’s our priority to limit possible disruption to our customers. As with all manufacturers, we continually monitor our supply chain to anticipate and prepare for any potential disruption and we are taking steps to deal with the situation, such as adjusting product designs. One example of this is in toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices (imageRUNNER/imageRUNNER ADVANCE) as we are currently facing a shortage of the chip that is fitted inside the toner cartridge to monitor its remaining toner levels. There is no shortage of toner cartridge itself – a shortage of the chip that lies inside the toner cartridge. As such, we’re now shipping toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices without this chip to ensure we’re still providing a continuous supply of consumables to our Canon U.S.A. customers. We have also issued guidance on how to install and manage these new toner cartridges.</em></p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-printer-ink-cartridge-false-fake-claims-161752274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c78161c1-e036-4048-baad-e5e087115abc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:17:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642010805</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Irritated young businesswoman looking at printer machine at office]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Irritated Businesswoman Looking At Printer Machine At Office]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' is delayed until December 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans will need to wait several more months than expected to get their hands on the latest game in the series.
