The list includes charming candidates like a melting smiley face, a disco ball, beans and a pointing finger in various skin tones. Not every emoji you see below will make the cut.

The new experiment comes in response to the Oversight Board, which has said the social network should be more transparent with users about how their posts are removed.</p><p>The company revealed the new test in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/facebooks-first-quarterly-update-on-the-oversight-board/">new report</a> that provides updates on how Facebook is handling the Oversight Board’s policy recommendations. The test comes in response to one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-initial-judgments-141352775.html">first cases</a> the Oversight Board took up, which dealt with an Instagram post meant to raise awareness of breast cancer that the company removed under its nudity rules.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook restored the post, saying its automated systems had made a mistake, and updated Instagram’s rules to allow for “health-related nudity.” But the Oversight Board had also recommended that Facebook alert users in cases when a post was removed with automation rather than as a result of a human content reviewer. Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html">previously said</a> it would test this change, which is now in effect.</p><p>“We’ve launched a test on Facebook to assess the impact of telling people more about whether automation was involved in enforcement,” facebook writes in its report. “People in the test now see whether technology or a Facebook content reviewer made the enforcement decision about their content. We will analyze the results to see if people had a clearer understanding of who removed their content, while also watching for a potential rise in recidivism and appeals rates.” The company added that it will provide an update on the test later this year.</p><p>The report also shed some additional insight into how the company is working with the Oversight Board. The report notes that between November 2020 and March 2021 it referred 26 cases to the board, though it’s only chosen to take up three — one of which was in response to its suspension of Donald Trump. (Notably, the latest report only covers the first quarter of 2021, so it doesn’t address the board’s recommendations in response to Trump’s suspension.)</p><p>Though the Oversight Board has only weighed in on a handful of cases, its decisions have resulted in a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html">policy</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html">changes</a> by Facebook that could have a much broader effect. However, in some areas, the company has declined to follow up on its policy suggestions, such as one that Facebook study i<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html">ts own role</a> in enabling the events of January 6th. In a blog post, the company noted that “the size and scope of the board’s recommendations go beyond the policy guidance that we first anticipated when we set up the board, and several require multi-month or multi-year investments.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-notifying-some-users-whose-posts-were-removed-by-automation-212939760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eef6f31a-662c-4e5a-bcc5-a2ce3f02cdf0</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:29:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626383698</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:15:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

The film, as far as we’re aware, doesn’t include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdain’s voice. “If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don’t know what the other lines are that were spoken by the AI, and you’re not going to know,” Neville told <em>The New Yorker</em>. “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.” In his interview with <em>GQ</em>, he said Bourdain’s family told him “Tony would have been cool with that,” adding, “I was just trying to make [the quotes] come alive,”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anthony-bourdain-roadrunner-ai-voice-210643678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4545b5b5-a9fa-4c66-a419-6337001cd889</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:06:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626383207</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:07:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN / Focus Features]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Candace Parker is NBA 2K's first female cover athlete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twenty two years after the debut of <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/nba%202k"><ins>NBA 2K</ins></a>, the basketball sim series will feature a woman on the cover of the game <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/nbar-2k22-features-candace-parker-as-first-wnba-cover-athlete-in-exclusive-edition"><ins>for the first time</ins></a>.

The past half decade has seen the introduction of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-23-elgatos-control-pad-is-a-livestreaming-sidekick.html">Stream Deck</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-elgato-introduces-a-100-mini-version-of-its-livestream-controll.html">line</a> for easily initiating macros during a broadcast; different kinds of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-ring-light-130016714.html">lighting</a>; and, last year, the company’s first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-1-wave-3-usb-mic-180533989.html">gaming microphones</a>. The one thing missing in this list was a webcam — until today’s introduction of the Elgato FaceCam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9152fdf0-e41a-11eb-9fef-b769a7c3e924" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on a monitor" data-uuid="15c721a4-696b-3560-8dc4-022955d0bc50"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>On its surface, the $200 camera is not that unique. It’s a chunky rectangular box that can be easily clipped on top of a monitor, or connected to Elgato’s multi mount system. It shoots 1080p at 60fps, with a Sony-made STARVIS CMOS sensor. It may not be 4K, but most streamers don’t need that kind of resolution right now. The FaceCam makes up for it with a robust suite of settings in its dedicated Camera Hub program. Yes, you’ll have to download another piece of software for this camera to run alongside Game Capture, Stream Deck, Wave Link (for the mics) and Control Center (for the lighting), which is a little annoying. Other companies bundle all their different drivers and settings into one tool, but I suppose keeping them separate probably makes sending out updates easier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d4891b90-e41a-11eb-be87-513e555c8a2c" alt="It&#39;s a me on the screen" data-uuid="07af371b-5453-34d4-b3a7-0cdfc5f55f35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>In the Camera Hub you’ll have easy access to things like contrast, exposure and white balance. (The latter two can be set to automatic so you have one less thing to fuss over.) The automatic white balance was a little warm for my taste, but it was easy enough to turn it off and knock the number down to a cooler 4000K. The software also comes with zoom options, but it’s nothing to write home about, as the camera is fixed focus. You’ll always be sharp as long as you always remain between 12 inches (30 cm) and 47 inches (120 cm) from the camera. That should take care of anyone working at a desk; anyone who moves further back would be better served with something a little more portable with advanced settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8b53ffc0-e41b-11eb-bf7f-1f13788d7e5a" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, close up to my chin" data-uuid="ed278b57-c136-3246-84da-d22b9a270e2e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest draw of the Camera Hub is the real-time ISO reading, which makes it a lot easier to detect and react to changes in your lighting. Maybe your lights are too bright, or maybe the natural light from outside vanished with an oncoming thunderstorm (which is exactly what’s happening as I type this). The exposure and white balance can adjust automatically, or you can tweak the settings yourself on the fly. There’s a Stream Deck plugin available, which should make it possible to adjust the settings with the touch of a button. Of course, that’s dependent on you having smart lighting in the first place, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elgato&#x002019;s Key Light" href="https://amzn.to/3wJcijR">Elgato’s Key Light</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ring Light" href="https://amzn.to/3zgzFD5">Ring Light</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/29971830-e41b-11eb-9bfd-df9544fbfa61" alt="Exposure, ISO 426" data-uuid="99257739-9e87-3e8d-86e4-a15a2486746b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s a definite sense that you’re meant to go all-in on Elgato’s streaming lineup, probably best evidenced by the lack of a microphone in the FaceCam. The company says it didn’t bother since most gamers tend to use headsets anyway, but let’s face it: Elgato would rather you pick up one of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:1" href="https://amzn.to/3e2F48h">Wave:1</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:3" href="https://amzn.to/2TY1DnP">Wave:3</a> mics. They do indeed sound great, but they’re not my preferred microphones thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-3-microphone-hands-on-150021908.html">some issues I had</a> with getting the Wave:3 to work while I was wearing a headset — yes, even one made by Elgato’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-corsair-acquires-elgato-gaming.html">parent company</a> Corsair.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27fb4d10-e41c-11eb-977f-553e0db2d59c" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, hey look it&#39;s me" data-uuid="31f9cc9f-c1fe-3c22-8108-cef3ca0be96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>For the most part, the FaceCam has a lot fewer kinks. My biggest problem was plugging it in, as it must be plugged into your system directly and not via a hub. And that’s tough with many modern laptops, which may only have two USB-C ports. The FaceCam comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, and the company recommends you use the included wire instead of providing your own. I was forced to search around for a converter dongle. While I commend companies for finally embracing USB-C in their gaming accessories, we need some solutions on the software side to ensure that they can actually be used with hubs. My Logitech C920 works with a hub and it comes with a built-in mic, so it’s likely to remain my default webcam for most purposes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/00665b10-e41b-11eb-82b7-111b8417758f" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on top of a monitor" data-uuid="f1265b1e-9f7f-34d9-8335-0edd662d58e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, the FaceCam is off to a promising start. The video quality is crisp and free of noise, and when it’s not there’s a built-in filter you can enable. I haven’t needed it to, though, as the camera has handled my Google Hangouts and Zoom calls with ease. The price is a bit steep, but still on par with Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Brio 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3hum19f">Brio 4K</a> and Razer’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kiyo Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3hSHB6i">Kiyo Pro</a>, both of which cost $200.

In a press release, the Surgeon General said that “health misinformation has already caused significant harm” and undermined vaccination efforts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The advisory includes a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf"><ins>22-page report</ins></a> on steps that individuals, health organizations, researchers and journalists can take to help mitigate the spread of misinformation. Notably, it also calls out social media companies, though it stops short of calling any of the platforms out by name. But the report echoes much of the criticism that platforms like Facebook and Twitter have faced during the pandemic.</p><p>“Product features built into technology platforms have contributed to the spread of misinformation, the report states. “For example, social media platforms incentivize people to share content to get likes, comments, and other positive signals of engagement. These features help connect and inform people but reward engagement rather than accuracy, allowing emotionally charged misinformation to spread more easily than emotionally neutral content.”</p><p>The report also highlights the problem of algorithmic amplification, which can make it difficult for companies like Facebook to prevent misinformation from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/viral-plandemic-conspiracy-theory-230626744.html"><ins>going viral</ins></a>.</p><p>“Algorithms that determine what users see online often prioritize content based on its popularity or similarity to previously seen content,” the report says. “As a result, a user exposed to misinformation once could see more and more of it over time, further reinforcing one’s misunderstanding. Some websites also combine different kinds of information, such as news, ads, and posts from users, into a single feed, which can leave consumers confused about the underlying source of any given piece of content.”</p><p>The report also recommends that companies “prioritize early detection of misinformation ‘super-spreaders’ and repeat offenders.” A widely cited report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found more than half of anti-vaccine misinformation online can be linked to just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html"><ins>12 individuals</ins></a>. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1415725645875740672"><ins>Jen Psaki</ins></a> also referenced that same report, noting that many of these “super-spreaders” remain active on Facebook.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">160d42a2-ecc4-4e8e-aca3-9211d3d9a7c4</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 19:12:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626376363</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T19:13:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/069e7c70-e5a0-11eb-a7b7-3ab26e0c4301" width="3701" height="2354" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/069e7c70-e5a0-11eb-a7b7-3ab26e0c4301" width="3701" height="2354" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H.

At the center of the campaign was a group known as Tortiseshell. Facebook says the collective went after individuals and companies in the defense and aerospace industries. Its primary targets were in the US, but they also sought out people in the UK and parts of Europe.</p><p>“This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while relying on relatively strong operational security measures to hide who’s behind it,” Facebook said. &quot;Our platform was one of the elements of the much broader cross-platform cyber-espionage operation, and its activity on Facebook manifested primarily in social engineering and driving people off-platform (e.g., email, messaging and collaboration services and websites), rather than directly sharing of the malware itself.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What went down appears to be unprecedented for Tortoiseshell. In the past, the group has primarily targeted <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain">IT companies throughout the Middle East</a>. The methods it employed were similar to those that China’s Evil Eye used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-evil-eye-uyghur-210523469.html">target the Uyghur community</a> earlier in the year.</p><p>Facebook says the group created “sophisticated online personas” to contact its targets and build trust with them before trying to convince them to click on malicious links. They had accounts across multiple social media platforms to make their ruse appear more credible.

The company has revealed the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck</a>, which will arrive in December in the US, Canada, the European Union and the UK, with availability expanding to more regions later. The system starts at $399.</p><p>Although the hardware isn’t final, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLtiRGTZvGM"><em>IGN</em></a>, the device currently looks like a mashup of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-nintendo-switch-oled-155417723.html">Switch</a>, a Sega Game Gear and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-27-valve-steam-controller-sale-discontinued.html">Steam Controller</a>.

The Steam Deck also has a headphone jack, stereo speakers, dual microphones and haptic feedback. It weighs around 669 grams and it&#39;s just under a foot wide.</p><p>Valve teamed up with AMD on the hardware. The Steam Deck&#39;s custom chipset features a 2.4-3.5GHz processor and a 1.0 to 1.6GHz GPU with eight RDNA 2 compute units. Valve claims it&#39;s a &quot;Zen 2 + RDNA 2 powerhouse&quot; that&#39;s capable of running the latest major games &quot;in a very efficient power envelope.&quot;</p><p>The handheld PC comes with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 512GB of NVMe internal storage, which you can expand with a microSD card. Valve says the 40-watt-hour battery will power the device for between two and eight hours on a single charge. The battery life will depend on how resource intensive the games you play are. The Switch, meanwhile, runs for up to nine hours.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da788a40-e596-11eb-8feb-978cb67dd0e5" alt="Valve Steam Deck" data-uuid="345bae6c-36c6-3317-8d1d-ea07c8d4486a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>Steam Deck runs on a new version of SteamOS that&#39;s designed for handheld use.

Well, we did find out who was pulling the strings behind the Time Variance Authority and why, but it really served as an introduction to a villain who’s scheduled to make his next appearance in <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, <em>Loki</em> never felt like an extended prequel to, well, anything. It’s been a show that’s stood largely on its own, one which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loki-disney-plus-premiere-review-160028040.html">forged</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-marvel-studios-loki-episode-two-180043690.html">unique identity</a> apart from everything else in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, including the Thor movies. After all, this isn’t the Loki we spent eight years watching on screen. This one was created in 2019 in the middle of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, a variant that so far is walking a path free of Asgard and all that pesky Avengers business.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4cd225a0-e57f-11eb-b93f-dae57671e846" alt="Tom Hiddleston and Sophia Di Martino" data-uuid="3d46082e-1217-30fe-bd95-e8d433838974"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>And so <em>Loki</em> the show paved its own road as well, not really relying too much on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">knowledge of the films</a> past the first and last Avengers movies. You could walk into the series knowing as much about Loki’s fate as the variant Loki and walk away after the first season knowing just as little. The finale was interesting because for the first time, I have no idea how a Marvel show fits into the greater scheme of things. And like He Who Remains, I find that a bit exciting.</p><p>One thing that has been true of all the Marvel shows has that we’ve always generally known where they’re supposed to slot into the bigger universe. <em>Agents of SHIELD</em> was originally intended to be a way for the side stories of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to thrive but for a while it was treated as a place to dump movie leftovers. <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em> and <em>Iron Fist </em>were originally aimed toward setting up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-marvel-the-defenders-netflix-full-trailer.html"><em>The Defenders</em></a> limited series. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a> was a prequel for <em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em>, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> did character work for the next Captain America film.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eb411390-e57f-11eb-9bbb-8b779f94e35e" alt="Tara Strong as Miss Minutes and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Renslayer" data-uuid="e13088d0-e2e0-31a0-bbf6-6589a71bb10f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But <em>Loki</em>, aside from wrapping up a loose thread from <em>Endgame</em>, doesn’t actually tie into anything, especially any upcoming projects. They don’t even name the man behind the curtain, he’s just “He Who Remains.” And he’s killed by the end of the episode, which means any time we see him from this point forward, it’s technically a different person; another cosmic iteration of the same jerk. Fans of the comics know that he’s meant to be <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/kang">Kang the Conqueror</a>, but that big reveal is yet to come — because the man we met is not a conqueror. He was a cosmic bureaucrat.</p><p>The conqueror, though hinted at in the <em>Loki</em> finale, will make his first full appearance in early 2023. He won’t remember the events shown in the <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/5bAzOD">Disney+</a> show since he wasn’t actually there, which means either the film will completely ignore all we learned here, or explain it to the audience anew. Prior knowledge of <em>Loki</em> shouldn’t and most likely won’t be necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4c361740-e580-11eb-9ffe-3f49ae979aab" alt="Sophia Di Martino and Tom Hiddleston" data-uuid="e6e3494a-b84c-381e-b748-b3256fd9d5a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Which leaves season two of <em>Loki</em> free to do almost anything it wants. The man who seems to now be in charge of the TVA is unlikely to be even close to the same man that Scott Lang and Hope Pym will have to tangle with, since we are dealing with a multiverse of possibilities. It does throw the next Doctor Strange movie into a bit of uncertainty, since in our original non-COVID timeline that was supposed to have premiered back in May. Were we supposed to see the debut of the multiverse before we saw its origin? Or will there be some other cosmic wrench to mess things up further for the MCU? A lot of things that seemed inevitable when all these projects were originally announced have now been thrown into uncertainty.</p><p>But for now, the key takeaway from the <em>Loki</em> finale is that the series is not beholden to anything else in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It didn’t have to load up a ton of character development or make sure everything is back in place plot wise before the next film. It’s free to take its small cast of characters and fully explore their possibilities, with no worries about how it will affect the other Marvel properties. What will happen to Loki, Sylvie, Mobius, Ravonna and the rest? We can focus on their individual stories instead of fussing over what can and can’t happen.</p><p>We can no longer make predictions based on future projects in the pipeline, or contractual obligations of actors. Theories can proliferate and almost nothing is off-limits. Every step Loki and the rest take just means another multiverse to explore in shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-if-disney-plus-august-11-183845530.html"><em>What If?</em></a>. The Sacred Timeline is dead, and so are the shackles of movie continuity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fafbe022-2725-48eb-93d6-55e95c1d85e2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626384928</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:35:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boastful Loki, Kid Loki, Alligator Loki and Classic Loki]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Council of Lokis]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Arturia made its music-making software more accessible]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When visually impaired <a href="https://www.jasondasentinstudio.com/">music producer Jason Dasent</a> decided to buy a collection of instrument plugins from Arturia about four years ago, he did so despite his suspicion that the company’s tools wouldn’t be accessible. He was right. “At that point I couldn’t browse and use the software,” he said. “I pretty much couldn’t do anything.” He had spent some $500 on <a href="https://www.arturia.com/company/press/press-releases/arturiaannouncesvcollection5">Arturia’s V Collection 5</a>, a set of virtual instruments that included recreations of some vintage synths he wanted to use. It was cheaper than spending hundreds of thousands on actual synths, he told himself.</p><p>But because Arturia’s preset manager Analog Lab wasn’t built to accommodate the visually impaired at the time, Dasent had to drop even more cash. “I would have to hire someone to come in for maybe three days to save these presets,” he said. For between $500 and $1,000, this person would export the presets to a format that would work in Avid’s Pro Tools, which had the accessibility features Dasent needed. It was a  tedious and expensive process, he said, but even after that he could only choose presets. He couldn’t tweak cutoffs, envelopes, parameters or adjust the brightness. “I had no choice but to just stick with the presets,” he added.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2019, Dasent presented at the Audio Developers Conference (ADC) in London, where he was approached by Arturia’s then director of software development, Kevin Molcard. Moldcard wanted to make Analog Lab accessible, and asked for Dasent’s help. After the company set him up with the V Collection 7 and one of its Keylab controllers, Dasent started playing around. Eventually, Dasent was introduced to Arturia product manager Pierre Pfister, who wanted to learn more about what Analog Lab was missing.</p><div id="6bc4b63a35bd46e9b53816ea8be606ed"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zeGbEBjEf-M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Two months later, Dasent said, he got a call from Pfister. “I have something to show you.” What Pfister then shared with Dasent was an early version of a new accessibility toolset in Analog Lab V. “It’s as if my eyes are now open,” Dasent gushed. That kicked off a months-long back-and-forth between Dasent, Pfister and the Arturia team as they worked on the prototype, culminating in the launch of a new update today. The company is <a href="https://arturia.com/stories/jasondasent">announcing a new accessibility mode to Analog Lab V</a>, which will enable all users to turn on auditory feedback and screen reading. It also brings various “ergonomic improvements and bug fixes.”</p><p>With this new accessibility mode, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-beginner-home-music-studio-bedroom-producer-guide.html">company&#39;s Keylab controllers</a> now communicate with the Analog Lab software and a computer&#39;s text-to-speech engine. &quot;Basically, as I press a button on Keylab, or I turn a dial or change a value, it sends notifications out to the system voice, allowing me to know exactly what&#39;s on the keyboard,&quot; Dasent said in a video describing the update. Now, when he tweaks faders and encoders on the keyboard, &quot;I can know exactly what the values are as I tweak the parameters.&quot; As he turns a knob on the controller to scroll through a list of instruments, a voice reads out the name of each item he lands on.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Dasent is familiar with Arturia&#39;s devices, he has the layout of buttons and dials memorized. But he added that &quot;the layout of the keyboard is very well thought out, so it makes learning where everything is very easy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The most challenging part of getting the software accessible for visually impaired users, according to Pfister, wasn’t necessarily implementation or programming — it was figuring out how best to communicate with the system’s text-to-speech. Since a lot of music software (and many creative products in general) aren’t designed with accessibility in mind, there aren’t many best practices to pull from. Arturia almost had to start from scratch. “The hardest part was knowing what we should do and how we should make a product accessible,” Pfister said.</p><p>Once they figured it out and showed Dasent the first prototype though, the results were gratifying. “His reaction made everything worth it.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9c267650-e413-11eb-8fdd-5851d610a46e" alt="A screenshot of Arturia&#39;s Analog Lab V, with a navigation column on the left, three rows in the middle for Instruments, Types and Sound Banks.

He acknowledged that Arturia is a small company and there’s “a lot of things we don’t know.” The plan for now is to continue listening to and soliciting feedback to “identify what most of our users would like to be able to do.” Whether that means getting all of the Analog Lab program fully accessible or to make all its individual instruments accessible, Pfister said the goal is to continue improving what it’s done with Analog Lab.</p><p>Like most of the tech industry, music software developers have, until now, largely overlooked the needs of people with disabilities. In a <a href="https://blog.native-instruments.com/designing-for-the-visually-impaired-and-how-its-changing-how-software-is-made/">2019 blog post</a> for competing music company Native Instruments, UK technologist Chris Ankin said: “Historically, music software offered poor accessibility with existing screen readers.”</p><p>Even the leading digital audio workstation (DAW) Pro Tools struggled with keeping its software accessible through years of updates in the 2000s. At the time, in an effort to keep up with the latest versions of Apple’s desktop software, Avid offered newer plug-ins and features in its OS X version that those using older editions of Pro Tools did not get. The problem is, while the pre-existing Pro Tools HD (which launched in 2002) was “almost entirely accessible,” <a href="http://www.avidblogs.com/music-daw-software-for-blind-and-visually-impaired-audio-professionals/">according to audio engineer Slau Hatlyn</a> in an article on Avid’s website, the software for OS X wasn’t usable even after Apple introduced its VoiceOver screen reader in 10.4 Tiger in 2005. The only thing Hatlyn could access was the menu bar. “No other windows were readable.”</p><p>It took until Pro Tools version 8’s <a href="https://www.pro-tools-expert.com/home-page/2018/3/27/a-brief-history-of-pro-tools">launch in 2008</a> for the software to regain accessibility, a long time considering “the previous accessible version was 5.3,” according to Hatlyn. Even so, the conversation continued, with Hatlyn calling out changes that broke accessibility between versions 10 and 11.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a948480-e414-11eb-bd7b-ad910e4e04ef" alt="Arturia&#39;s KeyLab mk2 keyboards" data-uuid="a3e0a414-c14e-32d5-bddd-4f916d26a226"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arturia</div></figure><p>And this is one of the industry’s most widely used DAWs. While Apple’s Logic is lauded as accessible, other music software companies that build assistive technology into their products are a rarity. Brands like Ableton and Image Line don’t appear to have comprehensive tools for the visually impaired in their products Ableton Live and FL Studios, at least based on the <a href="https://forum.ableton.com/viewtopic.php?t=230533">comments on</a><a href="https://forum.image-line.com/viewtopic.php?t=188683">their forums</a>. A spokesperson for Ableton highlighted a Zoom Display feature, as well as recent updates to improve contrast, reduce automatic colors and adjust grid intensity as tools in Live for visually impaired users. The spokesperson added “We’re aware that there is much more to be done here.” Image Line has yet to respond to our request for comment.</p><p>Will Butler, the vice president of company whose app, Be My Eyes, connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers, wrote a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/music-software-accessible-we-rank-best-worst-apps-will-butler">LinkedIn post</a> about the accessibility of music software. In it, Butler asked blind music producer Byron Harden to anecdotally rank the accessibility of popular music software. While Harden placed GarageBand, Pro Tools, Audacity and Logic in the top four, awarding them passing scores out of ten, Ableton Live and FL Studio came in near the bottom with one point each.</p><p>Butler also highlighted Native Instruments for its efforts. In 2019, the company expanded support for Mac’s VoiceOver, as well as Narrator and the Speech API in Windows. Prior to that, Native Instruments <a href="https://blog.native-instruments.com/how-komplete-kontrol-is-empowering-visually-impaired-musicians/">had made keyboards with</a> touch-sensitive rotary encoders and buttons with auditory feedback. With those, its software “can detect when the user’s fingers are resting on them, then give auditory feedback – synthesized speech – of the current value, and do so continuously as it’s adjusted.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="f08b1706c51d4a039032eaf9f5e3ecea" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26059fa0-e571-11eb-9e77-20d75cb541e2" alt="Music producer Jason Dasent playing on an Arturia keyboard"></section><p>That auditory feedback is one of the features Arturia is bringing to Analog Lab V that Dasent is most grateful for. “One thing they got right: quality of feedback,” he said. Say for example you load a preset. When you hit the load button in Analog Lab V, it will say “Loaded” and read out the name of the pack. Dasent said that software can sometimes offer too much feedback or use overly lengthy sentences and phrases to communicate. It would be like a sighted person having to read 20 lines of text to get one little piece of information that a single sentence could have conveyed.&nbsp;</p><p>As Pfister recalled his first call with Dasent, he was amazed and shocked by the amount of effort Dasent was willing to expend to use Arturia’s instruments. “If they are willing to put in that much effort, why don’t we do a little bit to make their life so much easier?”</p><p>Indeed, while there are frontrunners in making music software more accessible for people with disabilities, the industry as a whole could benefit from a published set of best practices. This way, they could be disseminated to smaller companies entering the space and make it easier for them to build accessible products. Ultimately, as with the development of most assistive technologies, that would benefit all users regardless of able-bodiedness.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-analog-lab-v-accessibility-mode-story-music-software-lack-assistive-160013048.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84c5f212-b42e-4724-847c-602b599177bb</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626366523</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T16:29:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7b0b040-e413-11eb-bf1f-639a585d58e4" width="3694" height="3014" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7b0b040-e413-11eb-bf1f-639a585d58e4" width="3694" height="3014" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jason Dasent]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Visually impaired audio engineer Jason Dasent sits in a studio, with his right hand on a keyboard in front of him.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jason Dasent in a studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED pre-orders open today at 3PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to secure the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">OLED variant of the Nintendo Switch</a> before its October 8th release date, now’s your chance.

It might also be the first flight of its kind to technically enter space. While Virgin&#39;s altitude was short of the Kármán line (62 miles) that officially delineates space, Blue Origin is keen to point out that it should cross that symbolic barrier.

Aston Martin has introduced a Valhalla supercar that mates a 740HP, AMG-made 4.0-liter V8 with a 201HP dual electric motor system to produce top-tier performance while cutting emissions. The two-door can reach 62MPH in just 2.5 seconds and hit a top speed of 217MPH, but you can also drive a modest 9 miles in pure EV mode if you can live with an 80MPH top speed.</p><p>The electric technology also helps save weight. The Valhalla includes an eight-speed dual-clutch transmission that uses the hybrid system for reversing, eliminating the need for a conventional reverse gear. Toss in electric-assisted torque vectoring for the all-wheel drive system and the car should be agile, not just quick off the line.

The company has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website">announced</a> plans to break out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-facebook-pay-unification-whatsapp-instagram.html">Facebook Pay</a> from its own ecosystem to facilitate transactions across the web. Starting in August, US-based customers will be able to make purchases from Shopify-powered businesses using the payment method. When you visit a supported seller, you&#39;ll see a Facebook Pay button allowing you to complete a purchase with your saved card or PayPal details.&nbsp;</p><p>In that sense, Facebook will be jostling for attention at checkout with rival mobile and digital wallets including Apple Pay and Google Pay. Of course, each has a built-in audience based on preferred hardware, operating system or, in Facebook&#39;s case, social network.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, Facebook Pay has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-facebook-pay.html">limited</a> to the company&#39;s own platforms including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook has pitched it as an expedient way to shop on those apps, split the bill with friends, send money abroad and donate to charities. Expanding Facebook Pay&#39;s reach across the web not only boosts its convenience, but also fits into the company&#39;s wider ecommerce strategy. In June, Facebook added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-qr-codes-payments-213052047.html">QR codes</a> to the payments platform, enabling users to send money to people outside of their friends group.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, it has integrated shopping features into its wider ecosystem of social apps to capitalize on the shift to ecommerce. In May, Facebook introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-new-shopping-features-171051648.html">Shops</a> that turn business pages on its main platform and Instagram into online storefronts. Like Google and Snapchat before it, the company is also turning to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-visual-search-instagram-shopping-190323553.html">visual search</a> to help people discover more shoppable products on Instagram. Not to be left out, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-shopping-button-152011215.html">WhatsApp</a> also received a shopping button that let users browse a retailer&#39;s product catalog.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pay-online-stores-121041167.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b2798917-7255-4420-8424-d9e31cdb4384</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626349016</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T11:37:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube makes subscriber-only chats and polls available to all streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube has boosted its features for gamers and live-streamers with <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/117186067/availability-updates-for-clips-polls-subscribers-only-chat">three more features</a> borrowed from Twitch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577574/youtube-twitch-features-subscriber-sub-only-chat-polls-clips"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

You just need to head to Windows365.com when it launches on August 2nd (it isn&#39;t yet live), choose a virtual machine configuration and you&#39;ll be up and running. That is, of course, once we know what it costs.

Developed by researchers at <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis">UC San Francisco</a>, the technique is a more natural way for people with speech loss to communicate than other methods <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">we&#39;ve seen</a> to date.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, neuroprosthetic technology has only allowed paralyzed users to type out just one letter at a time, a process that can be slow and laborious. It also tapped parts of the brain that control the arm or hand, a system that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive for the subject.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The USCF system, however, uses an implant that&#39;s placed directly on the part of the brain dedicated to speech. That way, the subject can mentally activate the brain patterns they would normally use to say a word, and the system can translate the entire word, rather than single letters, to the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it work, patients with normal speech volunteered to have their brain recordings analyzed for speech related activities. Researchers were then able to analyze those patterns and develop new methods to decode them in real time, using statistical language models to improve accuracy.&nbsp;</p><div id="9dc1b71b29ca4459a6eefda9c48dd6ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GMcf1fXdW8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, the team still wasn&#39;t sure if brain signals controlling the vocal tract would still be intact in patients paralyzed for many years. To that end, they enlisted an anonymous participant (known as Bravo1) who worked with researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary that the team could decipher using advanced computer algorithms. That included words like &quot;water,&quot; &quot;family&quot; and &quot;good,&quot; enough to allow the patient to create hundreds of sentences applicable to their daily life. The team also used an &quot;auto-correct&quot; function similar to those found on consumer speech recognition apps.&nbsp;</p><p>To test the system, the team asked patient Bravo1 to reply to questions like &quot;How are you today?&quot; and &quot;Would you like some water?&quot; The patient&#39;s attempted speech then appeared on the screen as &quot;I am very good,&quot; and &quot;No, I am not thirsty.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The system was able to decode their speech at up to 18 words per minute with 93 percent accuracy, with a 75 percent median accuracy. That might not sound great compared to the 200 words per minute possible with normal speech, but it&#39;s much better than the speeds seen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">previous neuroprosthetic systems</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak,” said Edward Chang, MD,  Chair of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and senior author on the study. “It shows strong promise to restore communication by tapping into the brain&#39;s natural speech machinery.”</p><p>The team said the trial represents a proof of principal for this new type of &quot;speech neuroprosthesis.&quot; Next up, they plan to expand the trial to include more participants, while also working to increase the number of words in the vocabulary and improve the rate of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/severely-paralyzed-man-communicates-using-brain-signals-sent-to-his-vocal-tract-110524126.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">788eefc6-08c2-4fe2-b7be-694819d33ec7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:05:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626345334</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T10:35:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UCSF]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
