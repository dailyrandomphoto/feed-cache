According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"><em>Protocol</em></a>, the tech giant launched TV Plus ‚Äî something that used to be exclusively available on the the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">brand&#39;s TVs</a> and mobile devices ‚Äî <a href="https://samsungtvplus.com/">for the web</a> in May.&nbsp;</p><p>It was likely a soft launch, as the publication called it, seeing as Samsung has yet to formally announce its web version and has yet to include it in any marketing material for the streaming service. While there was zero fanfare surrounding TV Plus&#39; web expansion, a company rep confirmed to <em>Protocol</em> that Samsung did indeed roll out a web version of the service in the second quarter.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung launched TV Plus back in 2016, and it has since evolved into its current cable-like free ad-supported form. It&#39;s accessible in 23 countries, and in the US, it gives viewers access to 140 channels that include <em>ABC News Live</em> and <em>Vice</em>. Samsung Electronics SVP Sang Kim told <em>Protocol</em> that the company streams &quot;billions of minutes every month,&quot; so it&#39;s clearly pretty popular with users. Its reach has been limited to Samsung customers up until now, though, and it remains to be seen whether the web version&#39;s availability can add a substantial number of new users to the service.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-plus-streaming-service-web-034944264.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ac589a55-8101-42d1-8cc9-f458bc503c56</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:49:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625888994</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T03:50:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f521e7f0-e12d-11eb-8ff8-c36eb6c1d8f6" width="1500" height="968" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f521e7f0-e12d-11eb-8ff8-c36eb6c1d8f6" width="1500" height="968" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's anime adaptation of classic manga 'Spriggan' debuts in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix has shared a new trailer for <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81050064"><em>Spriggan</em></a>, its upcoming adaption of Hiroshi Takashige and Ryoji Minagawa‚Äôs seminal manga of the same name.

For the past year, the service has been testing and tweaking systems to find and take down such content. It will <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/advancing-our-approach-to-user-safety"><ins>roll out those systems</ins></a> in the US and Canada over the next few weeks.</p><p>To start with, the algorithms will <a href="https://www.axios.com/tiktok-automation-video-removals-5388a03a-4625-4435-9311-ede21fafc148.html"><ins>be on the lookout</ins></a> for posts that violate policies related to the safety of minors, violence, graphic content, nudity, sex, illegal activity and regulated goods. If the systems detect a violation, they&#39;ll yank the video immediately and the user who posted it can appeal. Users can still flag videos for manual review as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Automated reviews will be &quot;reserved for content categories where our technology has the highest degree of accuracy,&quot; TikTok said. Only one in 20 of the videos that have been automatically removed were false positives and should have remained on the platform, according to the company. TikTok hopes to improve the algorithms&#39; accuracy levels and notes that &quot;requests to appeal a video&#39;s removal have remained consistent.&quot;</p><p>TikTok says automation should free up its safety staff to focus on content that requires a more nuanced approach, including videos containing bullying, harassment, misinformation and hate speech. Crucially, the systems could reduce the number of potentially distressing videos that the safety team have to watch, such as those containing extreme violence or child exploitation. Facebook, for one, has been accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ireland-content-moderators-183059300.html"><ins>not doing enough</ins></a> to protect the wellbeing and mental health of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-lawsuit-settlement-212601146.html"><ins>content moderators</ins></a> who are tasked with reviewing often-disturbing content.</p><p>Elsewhere, TikTok is changing how it notifies users after they&#39;re caught breaking rules. The platform now tracks the number, severity and frequency of violations. Users will see details about those in the account updates section of their inbox. They can also view information about the consequences of their actions, such as how long they&#39;re suspended from posting or engaging with anyone else&#39;s content.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-automatic-content-removal-violence-nudity-171158047.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86aae845-f4b3-4ed7-84a7-a2c64037901a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 17:11:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625849110</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T16:45:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1683b410-f7db-11ea-bdf9-e37c87cf7fe0" width="6022" height="4014" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1683b410-f7db-11ea-bdf9-e37c87cf7fe0" width="6022" height="4014" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The TikTok logo is pictured outside the company's U.S. head office in Culver City, California, U.S.,  September 15, 2020.

Then you‚Äôve got the ID.4 which starts at $40,000 and boasts 50 miles more range but, in my opinion at least, doesn&#39;t offer quite the same level of refinement that I saw in the C40 Recharge.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/817ecb20-e0cd-11eb-bfd5-4d5a46884bfd" style="height:900;width:1200;" alt="Volvo C40 Recharge" data-uuid="e647de5a-0fb7-3106-a42b-b00f2ee41add"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure><p>The C40 is expected to hit US streets in the first quarter of 2022 but it will not be available for sale through Volvo dealerships.

The tiny mixers are lightweight, offer bags of connectivity and won‚Äôt break the bank. The latest model, the ‚Äú<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pro-X" href="https://fave.co/3k3zTZI">Pro-X</a>,‚Äù brings some modest but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-go-mixer-pro-x-guitar-pedal-mobile-input-mixer-133253000.html">important upgrades</a> from the original <a href="https://www.roland.com/global/products/gomixer_pro/">Go:Mixer Pro</a>.</p><p>The main newness here is less about the audio and more about compatibility: Roland claims the Pro-X adds better support for Android phones and iOS devices. Don‚Äôt worry, there <em>is</em> some extra audio functionality. Namely, a new gain ‚Äúpad‚Äù for guitars (to attenuate volume on active pickups) and the headphone/monitor port is now bi-directional (i.e. it‚Äôs also an input). Roland pitches the latter as a way to record the inline mic in your headphones, but you can also plug in a lavalier/3.5mm source too, if you can live without monitoring.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The rest of the Pro-X is the same as the Pro before it. There‚Äôs a single XLR combi port on the right hand side for microphones and 1/4-inch devices. Also on this side you‚Äôll find the phantom power switch (for when using condenser microphones), a smartphone/line level 3.5mm input and a guitar/bass port. The front edge hosts two more 3.5mm line level inputs, that new pad switch, the updated dual-directional headphone port and the phone loopback switch. The left hand side has just a pair of 1/4-inch instrument inputs and the battery cover for four AAA cells needed for the phantom power.</p><p>In short, if it has, or can be converted to, a 3.5mm port, a quarter-inch jack or an XLR connector you can likely use it here.</p><p>On the top face of the Pro-X is where you‚Äôll find all the gain rotaries for each input. A few things to note though: the ‚Äúsmartphone‚Äù 3.5mm input doesn‚Äôt have a gain control, you‚Äôll need to adjust that on the phone itself. Although, you can also plug a phone into one of the quarter-inch ports with an adapter, in which case you will have volume control with one of the ports if that‚Äôs important. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that the master volume is also the monitor gain which is a little inconvenient if you want high monitoring levels but low gain on your recording or vice versa.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5e036490-e0c2-11eb-bbf5-bedbdac8c380" alt="Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on." data-uuid="ee6e6cd7-c4c7-3898-97ed-073e2ad2bca5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Given that the Pro-X has been designed to work with your phone, there‚Äôs a handy ridge along the battery compartment that doubles as a slot for your handset. Obviously this means you don‚Äôt need to have your phone lying around like a tethered paperweight, but it also provides a good position for the camera should you wish to livestream a performance. My iPhone 12 with a case doesn‚Äôt <em>quite</em> fit in the groove perfectly, but enough that the phone is steady when using it.</p><p>If there‚Äôs one immediate thing I would change, it‚Äôs the ‚Äúpeak‚Äù indicator. Unlike a DJ mixer where you would have a full strip of LEDs indicating the volume of each channel and a separate one for the master volume, the Pro-X has a single LED that will flash red when any input goes over the maximum threshold (i.e. clipping). It‚Äôs quite possible to set your levels so that there‚Äôs no red light showing during your checks, and then just one plosive can send it over. If there was a way to constantly see how close you are to 0dB that would be much more helpful.</p><p>Worse than that, though, I found that some of my recordings that <em>didn‚Äôt</em> trigger the red light could be a little distorted on playback. While speaking into the microphone, everything looked fine, but the recording was often ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù in louder sections. Thankfully, you can actually hear this in your headphones while it‚Äôs happening, so you can adjust the levels before hitting record, but ultimately what‚Äôs the clipping light for if it‚Äôs not reliably preventing you from overdriving things? It made me pretty nervous about each recording until I had experimented with various levels and put more confidence in the monitoring.</p><p>After some testing with different mics, it became clear that dynamic mics are fine, but any condenser I tried needed much more headroom to avoid sounding harsh. It‚Äôs not clear whether this is a pre-amp or phantom power issue, or just the extra sensitive nature of condensers. When I tested with a Shure SM59 (dynamic/no phantom power), for example, I was able to ‚Äî in fact almost had to ‚Äî set the gain to full, and even if the master volume was at 75 percent there was still plenty of headroom.</p><p>And that brings us back to the fact that the monitor level control is the same as the master gain. You probably want your levels quite modest to make sure you don‚Äôt clip, but in doing so, your monitoring levels are also low, making it harder to hear your mix is how you want it, you know, kinda important things.</p><p>I largely avoided this issue by making sure that I was recording into something that showed more detailed levels. Rode‚Äôs Reporter app, for example, has a nice, broad meter showing you how hot your signal is and it was much easier to use that as a gauge of the aggregate output.</p><p>Teething problems aside, once you‚Äôre all set, it‚Äôs all very straightforward. Like I mentioned above, I preferred plugging in a phone (or any other 3.5mm source to be fair) via the Guitar port. Having the rotary dial for volume allows you to adjust the volume on the fly much more fluidly, which is handy if you want to use music beds or other such sources where you might want to dynamically alter the volume.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/865e8230-e0c2-11eb-a9fc-b02c45b08793" alt="Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on." data-uuid="6cba7eab-2a0d-33c0-b384-09e70153d454"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Likewise, if you want to use two XLR microphones ‚Äî say for a podcast or a vocal and a mic‚Äôd instrument) ‚Äî you can co-opt one of the 3.5mm ports with something like an<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid: iRig Pre 2" href="https://fave.co/3huf5c1"> iRig Pre 2</a>. This means spending out on another bit of gear, but if you record often, having an XLR-to-3.5mm adapter/interface is pretty handy to have around.</p><p>As for that new ability to record with the inline mic on your headphones, all I can say is‚Ä¶ it works? Those inline mics are never any good, but it‚Äôs never a bad thing to have more inputs, and might work well for more conversational podcasts or just recording phone interviews. As already mentioned, you can actually feed in other inputs here if you don‚Äôt need to monitor, say if you‚Äôre recording a voice over or something for a multitrack piece you want to edit later.</p><p>Perhaps the most interesting thing, for me, is what <em>else</em> can I use this for? Its credentials as a portable mixer for musicians are obvious. But I also feel like it‚Äôs just something handy to have around if you work with audio in any way. I‚Äôve become something of an audio-adapter collector. I have all sorts of cables, interfaces and various types of microphones. Something like the Pro-X appeals to me as a simple way to put lots of those together into a portable setup.</p><p>The wealth of inputs means it‚Äôs pretty flexible, too. That‚Äôs a pretty compelling combo right there. The levels issue I mentioned earlier is more about learning how to set things up. Once I figured it out it was rarely a problem after that.</p><p>I do wish that the monitor volume was separate from the master volume for those occasions where you really do want to record low but still hear how the mix sounds together. Maybe that‚Äôs something we can hope for in a future model.</p><p>Whether you‚Äôre a garage band, an artist on the move or a podcaster that likes to get out in the big wide world there‚Äôs a lot to like here. At <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$150" href="https://fave.co/3k3zTZI">$150</a>, it‚Äôs also a relatively modest investment for something you can easily fit in your back pocket.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rolands-go-mixer-pro-x-studio-in-your-pocket-160021589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5efd2f0-aa6b-488e-a6c5-a2cdfa29ae77</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625851045</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T17:17:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d06a9d10-e0c1-11eb-bebe-bf03a2b6a9b3" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d06a9d10-e0c1-11eb-bebe-bf03a2b6a9b3" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roland Go:Mixer Pro X hands-on]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This week's best deals: $30 off Apple's 10.2-inch iPad and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of new tech deals came up across the web this week, plus there are a few July 4th sales that are still going on.

For years, they‚Äôve largely looked the same ‚Äî plastic or metal rectangles attached to some generic silicone or nylon strap.</p><p>Fitbit likes to say its wearables resemble jewelry. But it‚Äôs difficult to make a fitness tracker that <em>actually</em> looks like jewelry and does everything from logging your steps, sleep and workouts to telling you to breathe and relax. The company tried its hand at a stylish fitness band in 2016 with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-18-fitbit-alta-review.html">the Alta</a>, but that device was <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/fitbit-alta,review-3476.html">just a slightly narrower Charge</a> with a finicky screen and has since been discontinued. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-price-specs-available-buy-now-170015159.html">the Luxe</a>, Fitbit is singing a familiar tune, once again promising a ‚Äúfashion-forward fitness and wellness tracker... in an effortlessly chic bracelet design.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design aside, the Luxe packs almost everything you‚Äôd want from a fitness band: a heart rate sensor, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring, sleep tracking, water resistance and basic syncing with your phone. <a href="https://bit.ly/3wvT5Sz">At $150</a>, this could be a great option for those looking for a simple no-frills tracker that stands out from the crowd.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Fitbit‚Äôs previous claims about how stylish and chic their trackers are have been questionable. They‚Äôre all just rectangular blocks with few minor variations. When announcing the Luxe, the company painstakingly detailed how it crafted the Luxe‚Äôs case, saying the device‚Äôs ‚Äúbreakthrough design has a soft, gentle shape inspired by the human body that sits lightly on your wrist with a jewelry-like look and feel.‚Äù</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f85c46bf-a02b-43c3-9c9c-f64b6ec0beee"/><p>It used techniques like metal injection molding to make the stainless steel case, ‚Äúproviding the warmth expected of handcrafted jewelry, all while delivering a level of precision needed to enable its advanced sensor technology.‚Äù After throwing in a few dozen mentions of how elegant the Luxe is, the company ends up calling this ‚Äúone of Fitbit‚Äôs most fashionable and comfortable devices yet.‚Äù</p><p>Co-founder James Park said ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features ‚Äì some that were previously only available with our smartwatches.‚Äù Meaning that Fitbit was able to squeeze advanced components into the teeny tiny body of the Luxe, which is about as wide as my index finger and just 1.43 inches long. It‚Äôs indeed very small and thin, with a profile of 0.4 inches. That‚Äôs about as thick as the Apple Watch SE, but about a third of the width. It‚Äôs also about three quarters as wide as a Fitbit Charge 4, and a <em>hair</em> thinner.</p><p>So yes, the Luxe is a dainty little thing, which is nice for people like me who have small wrists. The stainless steel case itself is slightly curved along the edges, making it less blockish than the Charge 4 and the Alta. But the strap you pick can make all the difference. When paired with the silicone option you get in the box, the Luxe still looks kinda basic. Swap it out for, say, the Gold Mesh version that Fitbit also sent me, and voila! Instant style elevation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca53-e04a-11eb-bfbe-34293ec4dd7b" alt="Slight off angle view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery. The screen shows the time is 6:30pm." data-uuid="3a917e9c-2db0-3ac6-be59-239b2432207f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That‚Äôs nice, but you could make most other fitness trackers look attractive by swapping in a pretty band. Where the Luxe stands out is in its dainty size and narrow width, and that‚Äôs good news for those of us who want something smaller. The added bonus of the Luxe‚Äôs footprint is that it never got in the way when I was typing or performing a handstand.</p><p>The bad thing about the Luxe‚Äôs size is that its screen is correspondingly small. This is a 0.76-inch AMOLED panel running at a 124 x 206 resolution. It‚Äôs surrounded by a thick bezel, which is probably hiding all the Luxe‚Äôs sensors. But this makes things like your workout stats very hard to read. The screen itself is crisp, bright and colorful. But if you have trouble reading tiny text, you might need a bigger device. Fitbit told Engadget that an update is coming soon that will include larger text, though we still don‚Äôt know the specific timeline nor how this will look when it rolls out.</p><h2>Navigation and in use</h2><p>Like the Charge 4 and Sense smartwatch, the Luxe has no physical buttons. But unlike the other two, this tracker doesn‚Äôt even have an inductive solid state sensor that detects pressure to trigger an action. The only way you‚Äôll be interacting with the Luxe is through its touchscreen. Thankfully, Fitbit uses a standard one here instead of its faux touchscreen that you had to forcefully jab for it to detect a tap. With the Luxe, you can swipe and tap on the screen just like on any smartwatch, albeit with a very rudimentary OS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca54-e04a-11eb-a6ef-45af42b261f4" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist leaning on a wet railing. The screen is off." data-uuid="29c8f4de-5397-3e5e-b521-cf20b7189d79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Swiping up from the main screen shows your daily progress and battery percentage, while dragging down lets you access Settings and enable Do Not Disturb, Sleep or Water Lock modes. Swiping sideways brings you through Notifications, Exercise, Relax (guided breathing), Alarms and Timers. You can scroll vertically on each of these sections to get to more functions. Double tap the top of the screen to go back (or swipe right). That‚Äôs it.</p><p>For more customization, like rearranging your favorite workouts in Exercise, you‚Äôll need to go to the Fitbit app on your phone. By default, you‚Äôll find Walk, Run, Bike, Swim, Treadmill and Workout (a catch-all for almost everything else) here. When you‚Äôre exercising, the Luxe will show your calories burned, time elapsed, heart rate and, where relevant, pace or miles covered. That‚Äôs far less information than you‚Äôll see at a glance on a bigger screen, but that‚Äôs the sacrifice you make for a smaller tracker. You can swipe up to see more things, like a pause button, but that‚Äôs about it.</p><p>As you‚Äôre working out, too, Fitbit will show your cardio zone below your heart rate, with labels like ‚Äúfat burn‚Äù and ‚Äúpeak.‚Äù This is useful information, but again, this is so tiny. I have decent eyesight and even I struggled slightly to read it (and it got harder when I was waving my arms about as I ran).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf07c33-e04a-11eb-bbfc-ec1372367285" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a concrete gray background. The screen shows a run being tracked with a pace of 26:00 and 0.01 miles traveled." data-uuid="136292cc-1ee4-3efc-ae77-d7753aae50e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cramped screen aside, the Luxe behaves like most other basic Fitbit trackers. Though notifications are tedious to read, it‚Äôs nice that you can send a quick pre-set reply or emoji from your wrist. The device will also buzz when you‚Äôve been idle too long, or when you‚Äôve achieved your targeted active minutes. When you lift your wrist, the screen wakes up to show you the time (in thankfully large font). If you wear the band to sleep, it‚Äôll use your heart rate to detect what sleep zones you‚Äôre in, and after three nights it‚Äôll tell you things like your resting heart rate. If you‚Äôve been running, walking, swimming or biking (or more) for at least 15 minutes, the Luxe will automatically detect and record your activity. You can change that minimum time requirement to something else via the app, too. Unlike the Charge 4, though, the Luxe doesn‚Äôt have onboard GPS and will need to connect to your phone to map your outdoor runs.</p><p>Something that‚Äôs new since Google completed its acquisition of Fitbit is the introduction of Fast Pair, which works with Android devices. This made setting the Luxe up and syncing it to my Pixel 4a a <em>breeze</em>. I charged up the Luxe, and a window popped up on all my Pixel review units asking if I wanted to connect to the tracker. I tapped yes and before I knew it, I was going through the welcome pages since I already had the Fitbit app installed. This is much easier than the old method of first opening the app, hitting the Add New Device button and then waiting endlessly for my phone to find the wearable.</p><p>There are some other functions that the Luxe offers, but only if you pay the extra $10 a month for Fitbit Premium. The company is throwing in six months free with every purchase, and that gets you additional insight like your activity, heart rate and sleep trends. It‚Äôll also unlock month-long and year-long reports on your wellness, detailed breakdowns on your sleep and stress, as well as guided workouts, mindfulness and nutrition programs. Without the subscription, most people should find the basic data the Luxe gathers is sufficient. But those who are keen on learning about their long term health trends might benefit from Premium.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca50-e04a-11eb-9ef7-e8ebfc6ad464" alt="Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a gold mesh bracelet on a patterned blue and white background.

That‚Äôs with tracking multiple workout sessions every other day, though I didn‚Äôt wear the band to sleep most nights. If you keep the Luxe on when you go to bed, and also connect it to your phone‚Äôs GPS a lot, your runtime will likely be shorter.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The most impressive thing about the Fitbit Luxe isn‚Äôt its style; it‚Äôs its size. The fact that this little device can do so much is noteworthy, and those with smaller wrists will like the way it fits. But its size is also one of its drawbacks ‚Äî its tiny screen makes things hard to read. Still, for $150, the Luxe is a well-made and capable fitness tracker that can track pretty much everything. If you‚Äôre looking for a simple activity band that‚Äôs smaller than most, this will serve you well. At least, as long as you have near-perfect vision.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-review-small-fitness-tracker-150008620.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e9e970f-69b1-4c31-b6b0-c01053faf536</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 15:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625841800</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:43:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery.

The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">just announced</a> that president Joe Biden will be signing a new executive order today that will establish a &quot;whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s targeting anticompetitive practices across a wide range of industries, including internet services and tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The order contains 72 proposals and actions, among which it specifically says &quot;the President encourages the FCC to restore Net Neutrality rules undone by the prior administration.&quot; It also asked the agency to consider limiting early termination fees and prevent internet service providers from making deals with landlords that limit tenant choices. In addition, it urged the FCC to revive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-04-fcc-consumer-broadband-labels.html">the Broadband Nutrition Label that was developed under the Obama administration</a> that would offer greater price transparency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The order also looked at how &quot;dominant tech firms are undermining competition and reducing innovation,&quot; and announced an administration policy of greater scrutiny of mergers. It would focus on &quot;dominant internet platforms,&quot; especially around &quot;the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‚Äúfree‚Äù products, and the effect on user privacy.&quot;</p><p>As part of its crackdown on Big Tech, the order called on the Federal Trade Commission to &quot;establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of data,&quot; along with banning &quot;unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces&quot; and &quot;anticompetitive restrictions on using independent repair shops or doing DIY repairs of your own devices and equipment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In other industries, like banking and personal finance, the order similarly asked for more robust scrutiny of mergers. It also urged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to &quot;issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with them.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar notions of price transparency, consumer rights, increased scrutiny of mergers and prevention of excessive fees were prevalent across the other industries covered. Under agriculture, for example, the order also highlighted the need to give consumers the right to repair their tractors and equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Proposals for the healthcare sector include allowing for hearing aids to be sold over the counter, supporting price transparency rules, preventing surprise hospital billing and standardizing plan options in the National Health Insurance Marketplace for easier comparison shopping. In the transportation section, airlines were the focus of the suggestions. The order called for rules around greater transparency and disclosure over baggage, change and cancellation fees, as well as better guidelines on when a company must issue refunds over delayed baggage or non-working services (like in-flight WiFi or entertainment).</p><p>After the order is signed later today, the administration will have plenty of work to do to get these initiatives moving. It&#39;s not a guarantee that all the suggestions announced here will eventually happen, but it&#39;s a clear sign that the Biden team is paying attention to the issues of anticompetition, a lack of transparency in multiple industries and other unfair practices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e8e7528-48e5-4431-ba8b-f4b76c7b28bf</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:10:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625842111</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:48:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about the situation in Afghanistan from the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, July 8, 2021. - US President Joe Biden expressed confidence on July 8, 2021 in the Afghan military and said that a Taliban takeover of the country is not inevitable.

As cool as they could be, they always feel like an artefact from a dystopia that‚Äôs yet to engulf us. When the air burns and the seas boil, you won‚Äôt be able to fit a 40-inch HDTV into your existence-support-pod, so these will have to do. It hardly screams ‚Äúaspirational.‚Äù</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt help that nobody ‚Äî not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-03-sony-new-hmz-t3-head-mounted-display-wireless-hands-on.html">Sony,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-01-avegant-glyph-review.html">Avegant</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-royole-moon-personal-cinema-headset-impressions.html">Royole</a> nor <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/heroic-failures/the-man-who-invented-vr-goggles-50-years-too-soon">others</a> ‚Äî has managed to make this concept work. Personal cinemas, then, have replaced VR as the go-to whenever anyone needs to talk about a product that‚Äôs perennially on the edge of breaking through, and never has. But, despite them being a solution in search of a problem, and their historical suckiness, things may be about to change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You see, TCL has been banging against this particular door for years and now, it‚Äôs gearing up to launch its first model. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-launch-140021028.html">The Nxtwear G Wearable Display Glasses</a> solve many of the problems that dogged those earlier attempts. They‚Äôre not perfect, and you‚Äôll probably not want to buy a pair now, but this is the closest anyone has gotten to making this concept work.</p><div id="a9bcba9e8767476f800a7d785b26a510"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bF_yc0eLSfU?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>TCL‚Äôs Nxtwear G puts two tiny displays close to your eyes in order to trick you into thinking you‚Äôre looking at a bigger screen. Rather than cram the glasses full of tech, TCL put two displays, a pair of speakers and positioning hardware inside. That keeps the weight down to a very manageable 130 grams (4.5 oz), much kinder to your neck for long-term wear.</p><p>Everything else, including power, is handled by the device you plug this into, and the list of compatible hardware is pretty long. You can use major phones from Samsung, LG and OnePlus, as well as over 30 laptops and more than 25 tablets and 2-in-1s. Essentially, TCL made a plug-and-play external display for your head that should play nice with any compatible DisplayPort-equipped USB-C device.</p><p>The company decided to swim against much of the received wisdom that we‚Äôve seen with other personal cinemas. Rather than trying to enclose the user in a black void, all the better to replicate that tenth-screen-in-a-mall-multiplex feeling, TCL wants you to see the outside world. Even when I tried the prototype, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-07-tcl-personal-cinema-visor-prototype.html?">back in 2019</a>, its representatives said that you should feel comfortable wearing this on public transport, interacting with people as you do.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1cf4ed60-df0b-11eb-befd-db9d0b00af7c" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-uuid="61c35401-9493-3109-8a77-52a2bd99c0dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>With every device I‚Äôve tried them with, you simply need to plug the Nxtwear G in and everything starts. If you‚Äôre using a compatible TCL phone, you‚Äôll get a pop-up asking if you want to use mirror mode, or PC mode, which sets you up inside Android‚Äôs desktop mode. The phone then acts as a touchpad for you to navigate around with your finger, although if you want to do more than hunt-and-peck, buy a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</p><p>Connecting it to my MacBook Pro, too, and the machine recognized it as an external display and I was able to work and watch TV with my primary displays turned off. In fact, I wrote a chunk of this piece while inside this thing, even if I had to turn the zoom up to mad levels to make sure everything was readable.</p><p>The Nxtwear G packs a pair of 16:9, 60Hz micro-OLED 1080p displays that the company says is the equivalent to a 140-inch screen. That requires the usual suspension of ocular disbelief but the effect works here, and the speakers do their job well enough. It‚Äôs worth saying that they are essentially blasting audio in every direction, so grab your Bluetooth headphones if, say, your partner gets really annoyed when they can hear you watching <em>Columbo</em> when you‚Äôre both in bed.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if you should expect pixel-perfect video quality from a pair of screens this tiny but be advised that they won&#39;t beat your smartphone. Certainly, HD video looks fine, but the smallness of the screens means it&#39;s really tough to see good detail. Colors were washed out, certainly compared to the footage that was playing back on the TCL 20 Pro 5G and MacBook Pro I was connected to during testing.&nbsp;</p><p>TCL‚Äôs pitch is to say that, as well as passive viewing, you can also use the glasses to work and it‚Äôs here that I think TCL may have some success. As I said, it‚Äôs possible to work with these on, and it would make sense to use them if you had to view sensitive documents. When you‚Äôre working, say, on a train, this is the perfect antidote to shoulder surfers and other drive-by snoopers. Of course, for whoever makes the inevitable joke about watching adult content with nobody noticing, have a cookie.</p><p>What TCL has managed to do is, several times over, solve the riddle as to why you could ever want to use a personal cinema. There are times and places where you could do so both for work (more or less) and play (in some circumstances). Unfortunately, while the company was making great strides to solve the technical issues, it didn‚Äôt have a huge amount of time to devote to making this experience comfortable.</p><p>Your mileage may vary, but I found using these glasses to be a delightful experience right up until the moment it became painful. It is, right now, impossible to use these for a prolonged period of time before something starts hurting, either inside or outside your skull.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0093a0e0-df1e-11eb-ba7c-a3a057e49455" alt="Image from inside" data-uuid="98ca7e5a-01bd-357b-80c5-a04f7c0b5831"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One of the more problematic design decisions that TCL took was to include a trio of nose pads that push the screen up and higher. The idea is to keep the screens in line with your eyes, but the unfortunate result is that you need to put the nose pads way down your nose. Like, to the point where you feel like, no matter the size, it feels like you‚Äôre wearing those wire grips to close your nostrils that professional swimmers wear during sporting events.</p><p>Then there‚Äôre the Temple Tips, the part of the glasses arms which bend down to hook over your ears. Whereas with regular glasses those tips are semi-plastic and can be adjusted by an optician (or at home, with a hairdryer and some guile), the Nxtwear G‚Äôs arms are rigid. Prolonged periods of wear mean that you‚Äôll get two slices of hard plastic sticking into the soft fleshy bit of your head behind your ears.</p><p>The solution I found to alleviate both of those issues, at least for a bit, was to pull out the nose pads entirely and wear them as I would regular glasses. After all, as a seasoned specs wearer, I accepted that the experience might not be as good ‚Äî but found that this was actually better. I got a full view of the screen and it was significantly more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. But, unfortunately, the reason the nose pads stand the glasses off your schnozz is to avoid it getting warm, since the Nxtwear G does generate a decent amount of warmth (not heat, <em>warmth</em>, mind you).</p><p>And then, finally, there‚Äôs the issue of eye strain which, no matter how I wore these things, still meant I had to give up for significant rest periods. Maybe, it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm short-sighted, and so my eyes are already weak and feeble compared to the average personal cinema enjoyer. But I doubt it, and suspect that lots of people may run the risk of an eye-strain headache if they use this for too long at once.</p><p>Now, I bet you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äògee, if these were priced like an accessory, I‚Äôd grab a pair just to see what the fuss is about.‚Äô I don‚Äôt blame TCL for needing to recoup some of the development costs for these things, but <em>boy</em>. These glasses are going on sale in Oz for $899 AUS, which is the better part of $700 in the US. Heck, you can buy TCL‚Äôs new 20 Pro 5G for $500 and just hold it near to your face and pat yourself on the back for your thriftiness.</p><p>Facetiousness aside, I think TCL deserves enormous credit for making what can only be described as the best wearable display ever made. And if you‚Äôre able, I‚Äôd say you should go and try these out, because my comfort-related dealbreakers may not affect you. And TCL deserves a fair crack at making these things cheaper and a little less prone to pinching, because we‚Äôre so damn close. Sincerely, if personal cinemas are going to become a success, it‚Äôll be because it follows the template that TCL has laid down. It just needs a few tweaks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-140057578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9720e18-ebf4-4cd4-af3c-5446ec231f12</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625848680</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T16:38:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of TCL's first wearable display.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Nxtwear Glasses]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New York City launches a cyberdefense center in Manhattan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-jbs-payment-032554207.html">Infrastructure cyberattacks</a> are quickly becoming a significant problem in the US, and New York City is opening a facility that could help fend off those potentially dangerous hacks.

Amazon‚Äôs<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html"> latest deal with Universal</a> is case in point.</p><p>Amazon has struck a multi-year deal for exclusive Prime Video streaming rights for Universal&#39;s live-action theatrical releases, which will kick in next year. According to a report from <em>Deadline</em>, it will cover blockbusters such as J<em>urassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out</em> director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p><p>However, the deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Just days ago, Universal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">struck an agreement with its NBCUniversal sibling, Peacock</a>, for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><p>So, that should mean that within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for a 10-month run, before going back to Peacock for at least another four months.</p><p>Universal‚Äôs plan seems to be shuffling the release schedule around different streaming platforms to ensure its movies get to more audiences across different services ‚Äî while keeping said platforms satisfied with what they get. The trouble is you might struggle to find the film you want to watch ‚Äî or miss the chance to see it ‚Äî unless you‚Äôre paying a lot of attention to movie release dates.</p><p></p><p>‚Äî Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm and ASUS made a phone for Snapdragon Insiders</a></h2><h3>An expensive phone for spec die-hards.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" style="height:1152;width:2048;" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="4b7b5ecc-33c8-32ed-8f98-144818e9d107"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure></a><p>ASUS and Qualcomm have teamed up to make a smartphone that shows off some of the latter&#39;s mobile tech.

Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds, which is a nice touch. The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea.

Netflix has long been releasing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-11-netflix-strong-black-legends-podcast.html">companion talk shows</a> for its original movies and TV series, including ones for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-crown-companion-podcast.html"><em>The Crown</em></a>, <em>The Witcher</em> and <em>Stranger Things</em>.

Now, the e-commerce giant has expanded support for the feature, allowing you to host or join a Watch Party on Fire TV devices. While Amazon didn&#39;t make a big announcement for the feature&#39;s arrival on the platform, it updated the list of compatible devices on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/adlp/watchparty?&amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=f543dd24c56857fcfe14091e6163c1da&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Watch Party&#39;s FAQ</a>, as noticed by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/amazon-prime-video-watch-party-support-fire-tv/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a>. The section now says that you can co-watch with friends and fellow Prime members on a Fire TV device within the Prime Video app.</p><p>You still can&#39;t co-watch movies and shows with friends on mobile, but you can access the chat section of a Watch Party when you update to the latest version of the Prime Video app for phones and tablets. That&#39;ll give you an easy way to talk to other participants without access to a computer, as well as an easy way to create and share Watch Party invites.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon originally launched the feature on Twitch back in 2019, allowing streamers to watch videos with their viewers. The version available from within Prime Video itself is more suitable if you&#39;re not a streamer and just want to watch with people you&#39;re close to. All participants in a party must also have Prime subscriptions, though, and they must rent or purchase the movie or show the host is watching.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-prime-video-watch-parties-091026377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f94d0f0-f7a3-45ef-9d3d-303ed0f9188f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 09:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625821835</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T09:10:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0df61120-e08e-11eb-bfff-a6f7666cc22b" width="1500" height="972" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0df61120-e08e-11eb-bfff-a6f7666cc22b" width="1500" height="972" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
