To that end, the company is introducing a few new features to improve the search experience. Probably the most significant new tool is chapter view right from the search results page. YouTube has offered the ability for users to break longer videos into separate chapters so that viewers can quickly find specific information, but they were only visible when you clicked through.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, chapters will appear alongside the search results, with a time-stamped image thumbnail for each section. This should give viewers more insight into the content inside each video, and you&#39;ll be able to tap or click right into a specific chapter if you find exactly the info you&#39;re looking for. We&#39;re not yet sure if this feature is coming to mobile, desktop or both, but we asked YouTube and will update this if we find out more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another new feature we do know is coming to mobile are the little snippets of videos that automatically play when you mouse over them on the desktop. YouTube says it&#39;ll roll out &quot;a version&quot; of these previews on mobile, though it&#39;s not clear exactly what gesture will be used to get the snippet to play.</p><p>Finally, some of Google&#39;s auto-translate tools are coming to YouTube search results to make them useful to more people. Specifically, the company is starting to include automatically translated video titles, descriptions and captions to search. These results will show when there isn&#39;t enough related content in a user&#39;s local language to be useful. YouTube is first adding these translations to English-language videos, and right now it&#39;s only being tested on mobile devices in India and Indonesia; the company says it&#39;ll &quot;consider&quot; expanding to more locations based on user feedback.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-search-updates-video-chapters-150005802.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d81d3b22-bc2a-48c2-9b52-3f7ebd68408d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 15:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629208218</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T13:50:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e064b8e0-ff61-11eb-be7d-e019fcac7d3e" width="2000" height="1500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e064b8e0-ff61-11eb-be7d-e019fcac7d3e" width="2000" height="1500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube search results]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube search results]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discovery+ is turning hit podcast 'SmartLess' into a docuseries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fresh off a <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/smartless-podcast-series-jason-bateman-1235042240/"><ins>blockbuster deal with Amazon</ins></a>, the celebrity hosts of the podcast <em>SmartLess</em> are taking their show to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/discovery%20plus"><ins>Discovery+</ins></a>.

The pair of Atlas machines leapt gaps, vaulted beams and even coordinated a backflip, all without missing a beat — they might be more graceful than you are.</p><p>The routine took &quot;months&quot; of development, <a href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/atlas-leaps-bounds-and-backflips">according</a> to the company, and served as a useful test of the robots&#39; ability to maintain their balance while switching behaviors and coordinating actions. This isn&#39;t just canned behavior, either. As with other recent tests, Atlas now uses visuals to adapt its movement to the course.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don&#39;t worry that the robots will chase you down any time soon, though. The vault in particular has about a 50 percent failure rate, and there&#39;s still a slight chance of failure at each step. Even a fist pump at the end didn&#39;t go smoothly, Boston Dynamics said. The company still has to refine movements that are limited by the very nature of the robots themselves, such as the lack of a spine and the relatively weak arm joints.</p><p>As it stands, Atlas isn&#39;t a production robot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bts-boston-dynamics-hyundai-spot-atlas-162437924.html">like Spot</a>. It&#39;s a research model meant to push the limits of robotics. Boston Dynamics does, however, envision this parkour practice leading to future helper robots that can handle a wide variety of tasks with human-like dexterity. Let&#39;s just hope they stay on our good side.</p><div id="65803f5d8a5a421ea737158231617444"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF4DML7FIWk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-atlas-robots-parkour-demo-141057531.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3fca9fde-5e58-47a2-896e-00b504161784</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 14:10:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629209168</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T14:06:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7025e600-ff5f-11eb-b7ff-188b86bdbc73" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7025e600-ff5f-11eb-b7ff-188b86bdbc73" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Boston Dynamics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boston Dynamics Atlas robot performing a parkour leap]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boston Dynamics Atlas robot performing a parkour leap]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scuf Gaming one-upped Microsoft with its new Xbox Series X/S controllers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“Luxury” isn’t really a word you associate with gaming controllers, but when you’re spending $200 on a gamepad, that’s essentially what you get. The fact is just masked by words like “Elite” and “Pro.” One of the companies making controllers at that level has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/scuf">Scuf</a>, a brand that even collaborated with Microsoft on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-22-xbox-elite-controller-review.html">official high-end gamepad</a>. Now the team at Scuf is taking its expertise to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/xbox">Xbox</a> Series X/S with the new $170 Instinct and $200 Instinct Pro, which bring back fan-favorite features like an interchangeable faceplate while also improving the buttons and switches.</p><p>I was sent the more expensive Instinct Pro, though rest assured that even the cheaper model is still high quality. They each come packaged in a patterned black box that feels more appropriate to jewelry than gamer gear. The standard consumer version will come with a black faceplate, but the one I received was printed with a map pattern in black, gold and blue. I really like it, even if I’m not a fan of the FPS games it&#39;s meant to invoke. The faceplate comes off with a firm pull, though five magnets underneath ensure it’ll stay put during your gaming sessions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/29458450-fecb-11eb-b978-4d8e70ec47f1" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Instinct Pro with faceplate removed" data-uuid="0850997a-abc2-3c42-8fe0-8997f742930f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The d-pad also comes off easily when pulled with two fingers, but my attempts to dislodge it with my left thumb while playing were thankfully ineffective. However, the package does not include a replacement. What is included besides the controller is one USB cable, two AA batteries and two convex thumbsticks, one short and one tall. To swap these in you need to pry the faceplate off then pull at the thumbsticks so forcefully it feels like you&#39;re doing something wrong. The replacements can then be snapped into place, though it might take a few tries to get the pegs to line up with the holes on the back of the joysticks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac9a14c0-feca-11eb-af67-ee187b5a6ea7" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Scuf Gaming Instinct Pro with faceplate removed" data-uuid="ae8b0f25-e1ca-3cb2-89fc-aea4847513b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The front of the gamepad’s layout contains the standard array of buttons plus a mute switch for any headset that may be connected to the 3.5mm port on the bottom. The back, however, is a different story. Scuf has included four buttons just south of the battery cover, which can be mapped to duplicate any of the front buttons. However, unlike the long paddles found on the company’s other controllers, these instead consist of two flaps molded into the controller casing that jut out slightly, along with two buttons in between them. Your middle fingers should rest comfortably in the two concave nooks the buttons create, and flexing your fingers backward is enough to push those flaps, so you never have to shift where your fingers rest as you do with your thumbs on the front of the gamepad and forefingers on the shoulder buttons and triggers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d7913a00-feca-11eb-bb2c-8ffe4676a269" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Instinct Pro in black from rear" data-uuid="286f2913-8091-3346-90f6-0e0d1b139c8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The triggers on the more expensive Instinct Pro have also gotten a bit of a redesign. Previous Scuf products allowed players to adjust the sensitivity and install trigger stops that gave them a shorter pull, like a mouse button. Now the triggers can be adjusted on the fly thanks to a set of switches that can flip the buttons between the traditional long pull like you’d prefer in a driving game, to a shorter mouse click for weapons fire. Each trigger can be adjusted independently, too, which can make the feature useful for even more genres.</p><p>The last new feature on the back is a button that allows you to switch between three different configurations — the controller comes preprogrammed with settings for FPS/battle royale, sports and racing titles. The settings can be changed on the controller itself by holding down the profile button until it blinks and then holding down the paddle you want to change and the button you want it to emulate.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/038b5050-fecb-11eb-af36-1a05144e84db" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Instinct Pro controller, top" data-uuid="275a19c8-5c40-3c34-8473-df688a16081c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from all the bells and whistles, the Scuf Instinct Pro has a really nice, premium hand feel. It’s solid but not heavy, and the grips have a rubberized hexagonal pattern that allows airflow to prevent excessive palm sweating. I can’t tell you how it feels compared to other Scuf controllers, but matched up against the standard Xbox gamepad or recent releases like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/turtle-beach-recon-controller-gamepad-headset-070200364.html"><ins>Turtle Beach Recon Controller</ins></a>, it feels premium. Which it should, given that it’s so much more expensive. Like all Scuf products, the Instinct and Instinct Pro are for professionals and other people who take their games seriously enough to spend hundreds of dollars on gear.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scuf-gaming-instinct-pro-hands-on-xbox-140030783.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc29b450-4687-4b10-9f1b-1020b2756910</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 14:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629144769</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T20:13:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3eb94430-feca-11eb-bd3d-8a74429aa9d6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3eb94430-feca-11eb-bd3d-8a74429aa9d6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Scuf Gaming Instinct Pro with map patterned face]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Scuf Gaming Instinct Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best Nintendo Switch accessories you can buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s shaping up to be a good year for the Nintendo Switch, with games like New Pokémon Snap, The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/famicom-detective-club-preview-nintendo-switch-130002504.html">Famicom Detective Club</a> giving us plenty of reasons to keep playing the now four year old console.

After all, there are a lot of great games to download and your system has limited storage space. It’s also the only way you’ll get screen captures off your console if you haven’t connected it to Facebook or Twitter. Samsung&#39;s EVO Select line is recommended for its speed and reliability, but it’s the price that you’re likely to find most appealing, with a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB card" href="https://amzn.to/3Aw95q3">256GB card</a> running only $36 and the more spacious <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB" href="https://amzn.to/3CEYtH3">512GB</a> costing $70.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Samsung Evo microSD card (256GB) at Amazon - $36" href="https://amzn.to/3Aw95q3">Buy Samsung Evo microSD card (256GB) at Amazon - $36</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Samsung Evo microSD card (512GB) at Amazon - $70" href="https://amzn.to/3CEYtH3">Buy Samsung Evo microSD card (512GB) at Amazon - $70</a></p><p>It might be tempting to pick up a third-party dock for your Switch. Don’t. There have been reports of Switches getting bricked by non-Nintendo docks, which means you’re stuck with the official $100 model. However, if all you’re looking for is a change in look, you can buy a skin for your dock (and the Joy-Cons too) that will liven things up. <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/nintendo-switch-skins">Dbrand</a> offers a range of bold, vibrant colors, and the skins won’t damage your Switch if removed. If you’d prefer something with a design, <a href="https://www.slickwraps.com/devices/gaming/nintendo/switch.html">Slickwraps</a> offers marble and camo patterns as well some attractive Super Nintendo and Super Famicom-themed skins.</p><p>If your Switch gets a lot of use, chances are you may have picked up some extra Joy-Cons and a Pro Controller. It’s a real pain to have to charge multiple pairs of Joy-Cons on one Switch, however, so a charging dock can be a great buy. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PowerA&#x002019;s Pro Controller charging dock" href="https://amzn.to/3fXupwH">PowerA’s Pro Controller charging dock</a> has room for one pair of Joy-Cons and a Pro Controller, keeping them tidy and powered up. If you don’t need a place to put your Pro Controller, the regular charging dock can accommodate two sets of Joy-Cons.

Nura might have a solution. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html">Nuratrue</a> maker has introduced Nurabuds that aren&#39;t quite as sophisticated as the earlier model (more on that in a moment), but are only available through a &quot;Nuranow&quot; subscription. Pay $5 per month (plus a $19 one-time fee) and you&#39;ll get a fresh set of earbuds every 24 months, much like your carrier&#39;s phone installment plan.</p><p>You&#39;ll also get &quot;discounts, benefits and giveaways&quot; as part of your monthly outlay, according to Nura.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nurabuds themselves are similar on the surface to the Nuratrue buds from before, complete with active noise cancellation and a world-amplifying social mode (ambient or transparency mode on rival devices). They&#39;re IPX4 water-resistant, too. Battery life is limited to four hours for the buds and 10 hours with the charging case, though. More importantly, you can&#39;t perform the Nuratrue&#39;s signature hearing test — you&#39;ll have to either import an existing profile or trust that Nura&#39;s &quot;in-house&quot; sound meets your needs.</p><p>This might be a viable option if you use your earbuds often enough to wear down the battery in two years, or if you just want to stay current. However, the subscription model might not make sense if you aren&#39;t a stickler for Nura&#39;s (admittedly quite good) audio quality. Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">second-gen Echo Buds</a>, for example, offer ANC, water resistance and other helpful features for as little as $100 in a one-time payment that lets you upgrade on your own terms. Nura is clearly betting that its reputation and people&#39;s habits will work in its favor — possibly a wise bet, but a bet nonetheless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nura-nurabuds-subscription-wireless-earbuds-132117967.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3e86713-971c-4f9f-be69-59590255b075</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 13:21:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629206479</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T13:21:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7052a6e0-ff55-11eb-aa9a-0ada57182184" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7052a6e0-ff55-11eb-aa9a-0ada57182184" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nura]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nura Nurabuds true wireless earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nura Nurabuds true wireless earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps now shows Bird e-bike and scooter rentals, too]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, this is awkward.

Notably, the Pro M1 has a built-in fan, something that Air M1 lacks, and it helps the laptop handle tough work like 3D rendering and laborious video encoding. In our testing, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">MacBook Pro M1</a> performed similarly to the Air M1 — Apple&#39;s SoC allows it to be incredibly fast and efficient, and it&#39;ll last all day with its 16.5-hour battery life.</p><p>But there are a few limitations to the Pro M1 that are worth considering before buying. Namely, the laptop only supports one external display and there&#39;s no external GPU support at all. While the latter is a bit of a niche concern, it&#39;s a bummer for those that rely on external cards to boost performance. If you can live with those tradeoffs, the MacBook Pro M1 should make a good workhorse.</p><p>If you&#39;re looking to move away from traditional laptops all together, Amazon also has some of the highest-powered iPad Pros on sale right now, too.

A team from the University of Applied Sciences Graubünden in Switzerland now <a href="https://www.fhgr.ch/fachgebiete/angewandte-zukunftstechnologien/davis-zentrum/pi-challenge/#c15509">claims</a> it has broken the world record for computing for the mathematical constant: It said it has calculated for 62.8 trillion digits of Pi. The <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/66179-most-accurate-value-of-pi">current record holder</a>, Timothy Mullican, calculated up to 50 trillion digits and was recognized for his work last year.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Swiss university, its team took 108 days and 9 hours to compute for the new value. That&#39;s 3.5 times faster than Mullican&#39;s efforts and almost twice as fast as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-14-google-emma-haruka-iwao-pi-record.html">record Google set</a> in 2019. A couple of years ago, Emma Haruka Iwao and her colleagues used the power of 25 Google Cloud virtual machines to calculate for 31,415,926,535,897 digits of Pi within 121 days.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Swiss team, as <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/17/pi_world_record_challenged/"><em>The Register</em></a> explains, used a rig powered by two 32-core AMD Epyc 7542 processors with 1 TB of RAM and a program called y-Cruncher. Its setup had 38 hard drives with 16 TB of storage space each, 34 of which were used for the process while four were used to store the new value of Pi. The team didn&#39;t use SSDs, even though their speed would&#39;ve made the process quicker, because the large number of write cycles needed for Pi calculation would&#39;ve resulted in high wear and tear on the SSDs, which aren&#39;t cheap. That wouldn&#39;t have worked, since the university wanted to demonstrate that it&#39;s possible to carry out an extremely memory-intensive calculation with limited budget and resources. Guinness has yet to confirm the new record, but after it does, the university plans to publish the new and expanded value of Pi.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/swiss-university-world-record-pi-calculation-122534717.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e12fef-cf25-4430-8ac1-f90c378c8a74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 12:25:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629201835</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T12:03:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6fa8c160-ff4c-11eb-a5df-793dce95a855" width="6000" height="3090" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6fa8c160-ff4c-11eb-a5df-793dce95a855" width="6000" height="3090" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olivier Le Moal via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D illustration of pi letter over a circle drawing.

The chip-maker says the networking tech can help support drone-to-drone communications and drone swarms. Both use cases are being explored across industries, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-24-nasa-drone-traffic-management-test.html">delivering</a> and transporting goods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-drones-that-announced-joe-biden-as-the-46th-president-elect-150014496.html">aerial light displays</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-dod-shows-off-its-first-successful-micro-drone-swarm-launch.html">military warfare</a>.

The first GPU, currently codenamed Alchemist, will offer hardware-based ray tracing and mesh shading and support DirectX 12 Ultimate.

This is the latest step the automaker has taken to address issues in some Bolt EV models that make their batteries more likely to catch fire. As the publication notes, GM has recalled the Bolt EV twice in a little over a year before this and after over a dozen incidents wherein the vehicle went up in flames due to battery-related issues.</p><p>GM <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html">recalled</a> over 68,000 Bolt EVs back in November and rolled out a firmware update to limit their charging capacity to 90 percent. In July, the National Highway Traffic Administration <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html">issued</a> a safety alert in July advising owners of 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs not to park their cars indoors or leave them charging overnight. That warning came after two Bolt EVs caught fire in the US. Finally, in April, the automaker released what&#39;s supposed-to-be the final software fix for the issue. Clearly, that wasn&#39;t able to completely solve the problem, and GM had to find another solution.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Electrek</em> says GM has informed some owners that they&#39;ll be able to start booking appointments to have all the modules in their batteries replaced starting on August 23rd. Owners who go through with the replacement will also get a new 8-year 100,000 mile warranty. That said, Chevrolet will only replace battery modules in Bolts produced within the timeframe GM suspects battery manufacturing defects were present. Based on the vehicles that caught fire, <em>Electrek</em> says GM will likely prioritize 2019 models followed by 2017 and 2018 models. The company will also replace modules for owners who routinely do deep discharges.</p><p>GM told the publication that they&#39;re taking this step &quot;out of an abundance of caution.&quot; Further, GM and LG (the battery&#39;s manufacturer) will examine the replaced modules and find their defects. They&#39;ll also try to figure out if they can devise an in-situ detection method that would allow owners to figure out if their batteries are at risk of catching fire.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-replace-chevy-bolt-battery-modules-fire-risk-100027066.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a04a1d91-ed99-4bfc-be3d-ed24e26a9162</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 10:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629208808</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T14:00:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f672e500-ff55-11eb-bc7e-a344b17a73c5" width="1326" height="797" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f672e500-ff55-11eb-bc7e-a344b17a73c5" width="1326" height="797" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A press image of a red 2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV parked in front of a building with grass in the foreground.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2020 Chevrolet Bolt EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Astro teams up with Timbuk2 to build the ultimate gamer bags]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As someone who regularly attends conventions like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pax">PAX</a>, I know the importance of a good bag for your gaming gear.

It also has two laptop pockets, and a full clamshell opening to make it easier to remove your stuff — which certainly should make your life easier at airport security. One internal pocket is designed specifically to carry Astro gaming gear, with a loop for holding your headset, a padded sleeve for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Astro;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MixAmp Pro" href="https://fave.co/3CUzuzG">MixAmp Pro</a> and additional pockets for cords and controllers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also plenty of small, thoughtful touches throughout, including mesh shoulder straps to keep you cool, velcro to showcase your pins and patches and a d-ring to hold your keys. And if you’re of the environmentally-conscious sort, all Timbuk2 products are made of recycled materials, and the company has an exchange program for your old bag so you can dispose of it in an eco-friendly way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6086f890-fec6-11eb-a6f7-49b52b788d36" alt="Sling back with a Nintendo Switch, Pro Controller and games inside" data-uuid="60953106-ad34-3464-a15f-6849484a76d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>But what if you don’t need a bag that big? 35 liters is a lot of space, after all, and all you have is your Switch Lite and a set of earbuds.

You can wear it on your back, front or around your hips because fanny packs are back. But this is one made for your Nintendo Switch, with 14 slots for game cards and a tricot liner to protect your screen. There’s also a pocket for your smartphone and a key keeper so it’ll make a handy replacement for your purse or small shoulder bag. And I mean <em>small</em>, as the CS03 holds a scant three liters. It’s more of a daytripper than a convention pack.</p><p>I didn&#39;t get much time with the bags, but keep an eye out here for a hands-on after I test them on the mean streets of New York and Chicago.

Spin, for its part, is already integrated on other platforms like Citymapper and Moovit.&nbsp;</p><p>Ford, which owns Spin, says this feature will be available in 84 towns, cities and campuses in the US, Canada, Germany and Spain.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-spin-scooters-202029507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">772ccb37-0e3c-4db5-967c-a6bb81735833</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 20:20:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629144846</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T20:14:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0812ad30-fecb-11eb-9fff-c20122390c24" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0812ad30-fecb-11eb-9fff-c20122390c24" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Maps and Spin]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Maps and Spin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A new tuna robot could lead to more agile and efficient underwater drones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robots that can swim underwater are nothing new. For instance, Carnegie Mellon fitted its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html"><ins>famous snakebot with turbines and thrusters</ins></a> earlier this year to give it aquatic capabilities. But few can do so with the grace, speed and effortlessness of a real-life fish. And it’s not that scientists have avoided trying to create a robot that can do just that, but the exact way fish swim faster or slower is something that has proved elusive.</p><p>Marine biologists have known for a while that the secret lies somewhere in the way they can alter the rigidity of their tails. The problem is that it’s difficult to measure that while a fish swims. However, using a combination of fluid dynamics and biomechanics, <a href="https://robotics.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabe4088"><ins>researchers from the University of Virginia</ins></a> say they’ve derived a formula that not only provides an answer to that question but also allows a robot with a specially designed tail to be nearly as good as its natural counterpart at speeding up and slowing down in water.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When they applied the formula to a tuna-like robot they built, they found it could swim at a greater variety of speeds using almost half as much energy as one with a fixed-stiffness tail. If you’re a cyclist, you’ll love this analogy. &quot;Having one tail stiffness is like having one gear ratio on a bike,&quot;  Dan Quinn, one of the co-authors of the study, told <a href="https://bigthink.com/technology-innovation/robot-tuna-tail"><em><ins>Big Think</ins></em></a>. &quot;You&#39;d only be efficient at one speed. It would be like biking through San Francisco with a fixed-gear bike; you&#39;d be exhausted after just a few blocks.&quot;</p><p>With a tuna-sized machine under their belt, the University of Virginia team plans to scale their tail technology for use on both bigger and smaller robots. They’re also developing one that undulates like a stingray. Their work could one day lead to a class of drones that can quickly travel to a remote location and then slow down to investigate the area. Like an aquatic snakebot, that&#39;s something the Navy could use to inspect their ships for damage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tuna-robot-university-of-virginia-200013926.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">833d9418-da31-4e95-83d6-0b7015c4e553</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629144019</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T20:00:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/573879e0-feca-11eb-bbff-97fa64093af1" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[University of Virginia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tuna robot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wikipedia vandal adds swastikas to 53,000 pages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wikipedia"><ins>Wikipedia</ins></a> vandalism is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2006-11-10-bitter-fanboys-shred-nintendos-wikipedia-entry.html"><ins>hardly a new phenomenon</ins></a>, but one user was able to add swastikas to tens of thousands of articles.

As before, it&#39;s a message board app that connects you to other people in a five-mile radius. However, that localized aspect, plus the fact that users can post anonymously, led to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-10-sarahah-anonymous-app.html">reports of widespread bullying</a> and harassment (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/27/style/yik-yak-bullying-mary-washington.html"><ins>and even bomb threats</ins></a>) on Yik Yak at colleges, high schools and elsewhere.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b2de0e0ed25948fea0d3f8b0786db054"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 ICYMI: After a 4 year hiatus, Yik Yak is available in the App Store again!<br><br>💭 Anonymity, location-based, the hot feed &amp; more -- everything you used to love about Yik Yak<br><br>👋 Now available on iPhone in the US -- more countries and devices coming soon!<br><br><a href="https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV">https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV</a><a href="https://t.co/HUAKh4elcA">pic.twitter.com/HUAKh4elcA</a></p>— Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) <a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The developers of the revived Yik Yak seem aware of the problem.

Although community management is a tough nut to crack and anonymity adds an extra hurdle to enforcing rules, outlawing a broad range of harmful content at the outset is a positive move.</p><p>After Yik Yak shut down in 2017, partly because many of its users moved to other apps like Snapchat, Square bought some of the app&#39;s intellectual property and hired several engineers.
