The two, along with whistleblower Daimler, supposedly agreed to avoid competing on emissions-reducing AdBlue urea injection tech in discussions held between 2009 and 2014.</p><p>BMW, Daimler and VW reached a deal on AdBlue tank sizes, ranges, and average consumption, and even shared &quot;sensitive&quot; technical details with each other, the Commission claimed. This reportedly halted competition and stopped the trio from realizing the &quot;full potential&quot; of their emissions-reducing tech. They might have cleaned diesel output beyond EU requirements, but apparently chose not to.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All three have agreed to settle the case. Daimler had been facing a €727 million ($861.5 million) fine if it hadn&#39;t disclosed the behavior. VW also received leniency for its level of cooperation.</p><p>Commission Executive VP Margrethe Vestager noted that this was a novel case — it was the first time the regulator determined that collusion on technical development produced an illegal cartel. To that end, officials offered guidance on cooperation that wouldn&#39;t run afoul of antitrust rules, such as developing a unified AdBlue software system.</p><p>That pioneering conclusion might cause problems, however. VW said in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-weighs-appeal-against-eu-fine-over-emissions-tech-collusion-2021-07-08/">statement</a> that it was considering a possible appeal against the fine for allegedly setting a dangerous precedent in unfamiliar territory. The automaker also maintained that the substance of the discussions was &quot;never implemented&quot; and that customers never suffered as a consequence. It&#39;s not certain VW would succeed with an appeal, but the fight could be far from over.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eu-fines-bmw-vw-over-diesel-emissions-tech-132924021.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b1533e3-5928-453f-80ff-dfd03a997f25</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 13:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625750967</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T13:29:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sean Gallup via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WOLFSBURG, GERMANY - OCTOBER 26: The Volkswagen logo is reflected in the window and body of a Volkswagen ID.3 electric car standingt on display at the Autostadt promotional facility next to the Volkswagen factory on October 26, 2020 in Wolfsburg, Germany.

The Amazon-owned retailer has an exclusive deal for Prime members that knocks $60 off the normal price of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AirPods Pro" href="https://fave.co/2TOBO9F">AirPods Pro</a> — and while that&#39;s not the cheapest we&#39;ve seen them (they hit $169 during Black Friday last year), it&#39;s still a solid sale for those that missed the previous opportunity.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy AirPods Pro at Woot - $190" href="https://fave.co/2TOBO9F">Buy AirPods Pro at Woot - $190</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> are nearly two years old at this point, they remain the best sounding earbuds that Apple makes. The Pros have a built-in amplifier and they use Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-frequencies to each wearer&#39;s ear. They also fit much better than standard AirPods thanks to their replaceable ear tips and they make decent workout earbuds thanks to their IPX4 water resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>We also appreciate the active noise-cancellation on the AirPods Pro — it&#39;s strong enough to block out the noises around you in your home or at the offie, and you can quickly jump into Transparency Mode when you need to participate in a conversation. And like other Apple headphones, the AirPods Pro use the embedded H1 chip to work seamlessly with Apple products. Those who primarily use iPhones, iPads and Mac computers will enjoy how easy it is to switch between taking a call with your AirPods Pro from your iPhone to listening to music from your MacBook Air.</p><p>In fact, we think the AirPods Pro are the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best wireless earbuds for Apple lovers</a> — but there are a few out there that are better for sound and other features. If you&#39;re not a Prime member or simply aren&#39;t sold on the AirPods Pro, you could consider the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$150 Jabra Elite 75t" href="https://amzn.to/3hvodgR">$150 Jabra Elite 75t</a> or the new, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$280 Sony WF-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/2SUP5x4">$280 Sony WF-1000XM4</a>, both of which have good sound quality, excellent ANC and solid battery lives. But if you do go for Woot&#39;s deal, just remember that Woot may be owned by Amazon, but it has a totally different <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:return policy" href="https://fave.co/3hQFqju">return policy</a> that&#39;s more specific and less forgiving.

You’re not sure when it will arrive or how much bedlam will come with it. All you can do is stock up on supplies and batten down the hatches. And when it comes to babies, there are so, so many supplies, from the obvious (diapers, a crib) to the unexpected (snot suckers, no-scratch mittens). Fortunately, babies need very little in the way of gadgets, but the devices you do need in your nursery have to be reliable, simple to use, and effective. Here’s a collection of items that proved themselves useful — and in some cases essential — when I brought home premature twins. Plus, a few favorite toys for good measure.</p><h2>Owlet smart sock</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a10b8d50-df62-11eb-b7f5-2291bb2f083e" style="height:1216;width:1920;" alt="Owlet smart sock" data-uuid="0b5c359c-be4f-3d06-9045-a2177a2f8b40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>Bringing home a new infant is both surreal and nerve-wracking, especially when you have almost no experience with babies (*raises hand*). Because my twins were NICU graduates, there was no question that we wanted a monitor at home that could reproduce the stats we were used to seeing in the hospital. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Owlet;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet&#x002019;s smart sock" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Owlet’s smart sock</a> is the only infant wearable that measures heart rate, pulse ox and breathing rate. That information is displayed in an app that graphs your child’s data and tracks their sleep patterns as well. If your child’s readings rise or dip outside normal levels, you’ll be alerted through an alarm on your phone and the Owlet base station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ve used both the second- and third-generation sock for the twins until they hit the weight limit. Strapping the sock onto a wriggly baby is not always easy, and a poor fit can cause heart-stopping false alerts. However, checking the Owlet’s readings frequently in those early days was reassuring to me, and over time I felt more comfortable as I got a sense for their typical stats. The sock measurements also helped me understand their sleep habits by reporting back on when they were sleeping and when they were very much not sleeping. The amount of information and support was especially helpful when I found myself worrying, as I could simply pull up their data on the app for reassurance. Additionally, Owlet makes a camera that can tie into the system to provide video and audio feeds and sound/motion alerts, so you can get a quick peek at your little one.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Owlet;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy smart sock at Owlet - $299" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Buy smart sock at Owlet - $299</a></p><h2>Nanit Pro baby monitor</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b068f670-df62-11eb-9b5d-837409d12b3e" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Nanit Pro baby monitor" data-uuid="40b65531-8edd-3177-bfa5-cf1821c4319f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nanit</div></figure><p>Once you finally get your newborn to sleep, you’re going to want to check on them roughly every two and a half minutes until you pass out on the couch watching Hulu. Regardless, there is no bigger transgression than waking a sleeping baby, so you’ll need a quality monitor to help keep tabs on your new addition without disturbing them. There are a lot of good monitors on the market, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nanit" href="https://amzn.to/3pGI7rw">Nanit</a> became a favorite thanks to its clear video and extensive features. The Nanit camera offers a bird’s-eye view of your child’s crib, and because it’s positioned over the crib you won’t need to worry about adjusting the angle. It needs to be either wall mounted or set up on its stand, but  I found the latter setup wobbly and fragile, so I’d recommend the stand, for sure.</p><p>The 1080p video stream is clear, day and night, and it can be shared with multiple caretakers. Nanit is tied to an app so you’ll access the feed from your phone; there’s no need to charge or keep track of a separate display. It also offers noise and sound alerts, which made it easy to get a heads-up when one of the twins was stirring, though I had to minimize the sensitivity of these in the app because they occurred frequently. It collects snippets of your child’s night time activities for your reference, and tracks sleep data. Nanit also offers a Breathing Band wearable if you’d also like to track your baby’s breaths per minute.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nanit Pro at Amazon - $300" href="https://amzn.to/3pGI7rw">Buy Nanit Pro at Amazon - $300</a></p><h2>Munchkin 59s pacifier sterilizer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/40ba2730-df63-11eb-8d53-555b6734a16d" style="height:1025;width:1500;" alt="Munchkin pacifier cleaner " data-uuid="226069fb-3ce9-3cf2-bfdd-bc3c706cbb22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Munchkin</div></figure><p>It wasn’t until I had babies that I realized how completely filthy everything in my home was. Although I have used the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wabi steam sanitizer" href="https://amzn.to/3ix9D9b">Wabi steam sanitizer</a> for the last year or so in order to deep clean the majority of the kids’ cutlery, bottles and cups, it’s overkill to haul that thing out for pacifiers alone. Munchkin makes a cute <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:4.1 ounce UV-C cube" href="https://amzn.to/3cAnuYy">4.1 ounce UV-C cube</a> that can sterilize a single pacifier in under a minute. It’s straightforward to use and easy to tote around, thanks to the silicone wrist strap.</p><p>You’ll have to first wipe down any pacifiers that are covered in hair, crumbs or other toddler detritus, but after that all you need to do is pop the binky into the cube and hit the button. The 59S lights up in a blue hue that fascinates my kids while it kills 99 percent of household germs — and that may include coronavirus, which the FDA says <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/uv-lights-and-lamps-ultraviolet-c-radiation-disinfection-and-coronavirus">could be</a> rendered inactive from the UV-C. The combination of pacifier wipes and the 59S came in handy during a recent trip where my kids were in a variety of different environments; I didn’t have to worry at all knowing that I could quickly cleanse their pacifiers without having to run to a sink every time they threw a binky on the ground, outside their sleeping area, into a pool or directly into someone’s cup of coffee.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Munchkin 59s sterilizer at Amazon - $20" href="https://amzn.to/3cAnuYy">Buy Munchkin 59s sterilizer at Amazon - $20</a></p><h2>Willow wearable breast pump</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/301ff850-df63-11eb-bef7-049c6979ddad" style="height:1531;width:2000;" alt="Willow breast pump" data-uuid="666c1cb6-5e87-39ec-9ec3-695af1e037ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Willow</div></figure><p>Establishing a pumping and breastfeeding routine is an exhausting challenge, so any shortcuts that save you time or energy are basically essential. Wearing a breast pump instead of being tethered to my Spectra was a tremendous relief. I could pump while doing laundry, working, soothing a cranky baby or even practicing yoga. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Willow" href="https://amzn.to/3iBNZAL">Willow</a> makes wearable breast pumps that are spill-proof (I tested it in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/willow-30-versus-elvie-smart-breast-pump-review-140030444.html">downward dog</a>) and comfortable to use. However, they weigh 12.5 ounces each and I felt pretty self-conscious wearing them around because they made my silhouette look like an exaggerated comic book character.</p><p>Willow’s system contains all the parts in an egg-shaped pump that you slip into a bra. The wearer can control intensity either on the pump itself or via the smartphone app, which also tracks a session and how much you’ve pumped. I particularly like that Willow gives users two options for milk collection: a reusable container or a disposable bag, though only the bag option is spill-proof. It’s fairly quiet but I still skipped wearing it outside for longer than it took to grab the mail. Although the Bluetooth connection to the app was inconsistent, it didn’t hinder my ability to use the hardware — or my gratitude in being able to move freely while pumping.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Willow breast pump at Amazon - $500" href="https://amzn.to/3iBNZAL">Buy Willow breast pump at Amazon - $500</a></p><h2>Hatch Rest+</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8ae1de80-a83a-11eb-aed3-01be4ca15df3" style="height:1000;width:1500;" alt="Hatch Rest+" data-uuid="b94901be-cd31-3e42-a5b2-643bceba0998"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hatch</div></figure><p>My love for the Hatch Rest is well established; I’ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-white-noise-machines-for-babies-140053157.html">written</a> multiple times how I use it daily, and how it’s been useful as a night light, white noise machine and sleep trainer. I’ve recommended it to friends and I even packed it when my family was being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hatch-baby-rest-gadget-irl-123051499.html">evacuated</a> from a forest fire. In case you missed those previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-gifts-for-new-moms-123052827.html">references</a>, here’s the scoop: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hatch Rest" href="https://amzn.to/3gsvYSC">Hatch Rest</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rest+" href="https://amzn.to/3gnDm1V">Rest+</a> are minimally designed, fully-functional smart home devices that can be programmed to play a variety of sounds and colors. There are 10 available colors, or you can create a custom one, and 11 sounds including rain storms and lullabies. You can control it either from your phone or from the physical buttons and touch ring on the device itself.</p><p>The Rest+ is more expensive at $90 but brings a few additional features like battery power, two-way audio, a dimmable clock, voice control with Alexa, and access for multiple users. If you can do without those, the $60 Rest should suffice. Hatch also makes an adult model, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Restore" href="https://amzn.to/2V8JJPv">Restore</a>, and recently released the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rest Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3jM9vU7">Rest Mini</a>, which offers a subscription to stories, lullabies and more kid-friendly content.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Hatch Rest at Amazon - $60" href="https://amzn.to/3gsvYSC">Buy Hatch Rest at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Hatch Rest+ at Amazon - $90" href="https://amzn.to/3gnDm1V">Buy Hatch Rest+ at Amazon - $90</a></p><h2>4moms mamaroo4 infant seat</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/581a5850-df63-11eb-9efc-756c92eefc00" style="height:1280;width:1500;" alt="4moms mamaroo4 infant seat" data-uuid="96e39684-585b-34f5-96fa-0a3aea26665c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">4moms</div></figure><p>An infant swing can be helpful to entertain your babe while you do other tasks or to help them gently fall asleep while being gently rocked. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:4moms mamaroo4" href="https://amzn.to/2TmGKSU">4moms mamaroo4</a> is a smart swing that not only mimics the actions that parents use when soothing babies, but can also be fully controlled from your phone. It is also blessedly simple to set up; the instructions are well-explained and I was able to get the whole thing up and running in under 10 minutes while my twins were distracted with teething crackers and <a href="https://amzn.to/3k1HyrF">Flappy the Elephant</a>. It offers five movement options (car ride, kangaroo, rock a bye, tree swing and wave), five speed options and four built-in sounds (rain, fan, ocean, heart). You can also connect an MP3 player to it to play your own lullabies and tunes.</p><p>The speakers on the mamaRoo4 aren’t exactly bangers, though, so if you connect an MP3 player or streaming device don’t expect it to sound amazing. It will do the job for kid’s lullabies or classical tracks, but it doesn’t get very loud and isn’t built to be a speaker system. The swing itself isn’t exactly silent as it moves either, though in no way is it annoying or distracting. It does muffle the built-in sounds a bit so it’s hard to distinguish between them. The swings movements seem subtle at times, but my daughter seemed to enjoy them. It is pricier than most standard swings and will work up to six months or 25 pounds, but it might be worth it to be able to start, pause, change movement all from your phone as your baby settles down.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy mamaroo4 at Amazon - $250" href="https://amzn.to/2TmGKSU">Buy mamaroo4 at Amazon - $250</a></p><h2>Withings Thermo smart thermometer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e42e5490-df63-11eb-9cfd-4077f1625f5e" style="height:991;width:1500;" alt="Withings Thermo Smart Temporal Thermometer" data-uuid="ab327d9d-c7ea-3a22-8f64-97dcd742fa9d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Do you really need a $100 smart thermometer for your new baby? Technically, no. But y’all, let me tell you it only took a single use of the Withings Thermo to win me over. Here’s why: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Withing&#x002019;s smart temporal thermometer" href="https://amzn.to/2SqENV5">Withing’s smart temporal thermometer</a> uses an artery in the head to measure temperatures. Which means instead of trying to keep a standard thermometer correctly positioned in the armpit of a wriggly, crying infant for an interminable time to get a reading you hope is accurate, all you have to do is gently swipe the Thermo wand across their forehead. You don’t even have to make direct contact with the skin since Thermo can still measure when held a half-inch away. It’s easy enough that I found myself taking my kid’s temperature more regularly because it was no longer a fight.</p><p>Thermo then displays the result on the LED display (which, for what it’s worth, really intrigued my twins) and you can press a button to save the reading. Because it’s tied to an app, Thermo not only saves previous readings so you can track temps, but it also lets you add multiple family members and assign a temperature to the correct individual. As a mom of twins, that’s the feature I was most interested in and it was simple and easy to scroll through profiles using a swipe next to the display. The app also helps you get Thermo set up. I will admit it took two attempts before I could complete this process but it wasn’t complicated; it just initially seemed to get stuck on the setup screen. Also, it’s worth noting that the Thermo started to take temperatures immediately, so I had a few results come in just as I was holding it in my hand and pointing it at a wall but these ambient readings are easy to dismiss.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Withings Thermo at Amazon - $99" href="https://amzn.to/2SqENV5">Buy Withings Thermo at Amazon - $99</a></p><h2>Baby Brezza Safe + Smart bottle warmer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/9fce5080-a83a-11eb-bfeb-5e1c9d26ad99" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Baby Brezza smart bottle warmer" data-uuid="655b48dd-cd4a-3c7f-ac00-65d451329e0d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Baby Brezza</div></figure><p>A good bottle warmer should be efficient, minimal and easy to clean. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Baby Brezza&#x002019;s version" href="https://amzn.to/3hE5bU3">Baby Brezza’s version</a> is a good option because it has a slim profile, which makes it convenient to stash on a countertop, along with intuitive buttons and controls. It can heat either formula or breast milk using two warming settings (a steady warm water bath or a quick steam warm), as well as defrost frozen milk. The bottle tray fits most types, too — I can confirm it worked fine with the three different types that I had in my house. I was able to figure out how to work it without consulting the instructions too much, and I was pleased at how the bottles came out at an ideal temperature.</p><p>However, the noteworthy feature of the Safe + Smart is the Bluetooth connection that allows the warmer to be controlled through an app on your phone. You can select things like warming speed and the bottle’s starting temperature before starting a warming session all from within the app. It will also alert you when the bottle is ready to go.</p><p>While it sounds like a niche device, it proved particularly useful in certain situations. I was able to prepare a bottle, start my kid’s baths and use the app to start warming a bottle so it would be ready right as they were. I could also start a bottle, then text my partner to bring it upstairs as I read bedtime stories. And the alarm meant I could avoid walking up and down stairs several times to check on the warmer as I usually do. It’s a neat feature, but because you’ll still need to add water to the warmer each time, it works best if you plan ahead to use it.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Baby Brezza bottle warmer at Amazon - $70" href="https://amzn.to/3hE5bU3">Buy Baby Brezza bottle warmer at Amazon - $70</a></p><h2>Toys</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2495630-df63-11eb-b0fb-09965d7305c0" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Skip Hop Bandana Buddies Elephant" data-uuid="2a838fdc-38c6-3419-9e16-ce4f558757d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skip Hop Bandana Buddies</div></figure><p>Infants experience the world around them through their senses, so they’ll be drawn to toys with a lot of colors, sounds and textures.

The most important feature of the Bites 2 Lite is its price. At $125, it costs half as much as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-petcubes-bites-2-and-play-2-hands-on.html">predecessor did at launch</a>. Naturally, that means some compromises.

They say Google&#39;s control over the marketplace violates US antitrust law. The bipartisan group of attorneys general behind the suit <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60042641/1/state-of-utah-v-google-llc/">filed the case</a> in the same California federal court where Judge James Donato is scheduled to hire Epic&#39;s suit against Google over <em>Fortnite&#39;s</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-android-225437892.html">removal from the Play Store last year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This latest action is the fourth antitrust lawsuit launched against Google following three similar claims in 2020. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-third-antitrust-lawsuit-175948359.html">In December</a>, a group of 38 states and territories led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed antitrust charges against the company over its search business. The tech giant is also the subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-us-justice-department-antitrust-competition-announcement-144344497.html">Department of Justice probe</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The timing of Wednesday&#39;s suit follows after Google recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">lowered</a> its Play Store commission fee to 15 percent on the first $1 million developers earn on the marketplace every year. When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">announced the change back in March</a>, it claimed it would reduce the fees it takes from 99 percent of Android developers by 50 percent. Later this year, Google also plans to enforce a policy that will require all developers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">process their payments through the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>. The announcement led to uproar among companies like Netflix and Spotify that had in the past skirted that requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the Play Store comes preinstalled on the majority of Android devices, it is not the only place where you can download software to your phone. Amazon and Samsung operate their own app stores. It&#39;s also possible to sideload Android apps from websites like APK Mirror, allowing you to bypass the Play Store completely. Both those facts are not true of iOS devices where Apple&#39;s App Store is the only place where you can download software for your iPhone or iPad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today&#39;s suit also comes a little more than a week after a federal judge in Washington <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">dismissed the FTC&#39;s antitrust complaint against Facebook</a>, saying the agency hadn&#39;t presented sufficient evidence to back up its claims that the social media giant is a monopoly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 07/07/21 10:30PM ET: </strong>Colorado has joined the lawsuit against Google, bringing the total number of states to 37. The tech giant has <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/">published</a> a blog post defending its practices, however, calling the lawsuit &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;meritless&quot; for &quot;attacking a system that provides more openness and choice than others.&quot; Google&#39;s Senior Director of Public Policy, Wilson White, concluded the post with this note: &quot;This lawsuit isn&#39;t about helping the little guy or protecting consumers. It&#39;s about boosting a handful of major app developers who want the benefits of Google Play without paying for it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">13888926-80a4-45a3-86b9-6cc3fdde71d1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 21:11:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625714860</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T03:27:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Young / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google CEO Sundar Pichai is sworn in prior to testifying at a House Judiciary Committee hearing “examining Google and its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 11, 2018.

In the US alone, roughly 8 percent of the population comes down with the flu every winter. The company hopes this vaccine will prove more potent than the current 40 to 60 percent efficacy rate of conventional flu vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We are pleased to have begun this Phase 1/2 study of mRNA-1010, our first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine candidate to enter the clinic. We expect that our seasonal influenza vaccine candidates will be an important component of our future combination respiratory vaccines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said. “Respiratory combination vaccines are an important pillar of our overall mRNA vaccine strategy. We believe that the advantages of mRNA vaccines include the ability to combine different antigens to protect against multiple viruses and the ability to rapidly respond to the evolution of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses.&quot;</p><p>This vaccine has been generated using the same genomic techniques the company utilized to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-vaccine-research-and-development-150052906.html">develop its COVID-19 treatment in 2020</a>. The technique works by exploiting the human body&#39;s own cells to reproduce snippets of viral DNA to instigate an immune response and prime the body against future infection. Since this method doesn&#39;t require the entire virus (either weakened or dead) but rather just a birt of its genetic code, mRNA vaccines could be applied to any number of deadly modern diseases including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mrna-tech-we-used-against-covid-could-help-us-finally-beat-malaria-153045965.html">malaria, TB — even cancer</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moderna-submits-its-m-rna-based-flu-vaccine-for-clinical-trials-172548543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">358fdb8b-5098-412b-92a4-48714f431ece</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 17:25:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681450</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Infectious Diseases]]></category><category><![CDATA[Epidemic & Plague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Medical syringes in the mini shopping trolley are seen in front of the Moderna logo displayed on a screen.

But it’s not quite the upgrade we were expecting. For months, reports claimed a “Switch Pro” would also deliver some sort of 4K upscaling capability and faster performance. But this new model, which will sell for $350 when it’s released on October 8th, doesn’t go nearly that far. Instead, it’s more of a minor step forward that fixes a few of the Switch’s original design flaws, but doesn’t dramatically change the system. And you know what? That’s fine.</p><p>If you’ve been following Nintendo for any amount of time, it shouldn’t be surprising that the company isn’t really interested in joining a spcs race. Let Sony and Microsoft duke it out for 4K dominance — Nintendo can show there’s still plenty to love about games in 1080p and below. Sticking with the same hardware also means developers don’t have to worry about splitting the Switch user base, an issue that’s plagued Nintendo systems over the last few decades. (Was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds.html">New 3DS</a> actually worth it?)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">global chip shortage</a> may have foiled Nintendo’s plans to stuff better hardware in this Switch, as well. The system currently uses a custom version of NVIDIA’s Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-nintendo-switch-upgraded-battery-life.html">quietly updated in 2019</a> to increase the console’s battery life. According to various reports, Nintendo was exploring docked 4K upscaling using NVIDIA’s DLSS technology, which uses AI processing to bump lower-resolution textures up to something that looks far sharper. But that technology would have required an updated Tegra chip that brought over some of the hardware from NVIDIA’s recent RTX GPUs. That’s not an impossible task, but it’s one that may have required more work than NVIDIA was able to accomplish during the hellscape of 2020 (at least, while keeping the final cost reasonable).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0370e9b0-df3e-11eb-bec7-1c955b9d7f3d" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="7be3a59e-e8e7-35a0-9937-6d314a89ca4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>That doesn’t mean dreams of a 4K-capable Switch are dead; it’s just something we’ll have to wait a year or two to see. Nintendo would also need to add more RAM to the Switch so it could better handle the 1080p textures required for DLSS upscaling. That’s not easy to do with the system’s meager 4GB of RAM, so a future console would need 6GB or 8GB. And don’t forget, Nintendo also needs to balance delivering solid battery life with the Switch in handheld mode, so it needs to be careful about shoving in demanding new hardware.</p><p>For owners of the original Switch, or newcomers to the platform, this OLED model still seems like an enticing upgrade. The larger screen makes the system look more modern, with less of a chunky display bezel. OLED will also make games look dramatically better, especially while playing outside in direct sunlight. There’s also a wider kickstand, similar to the one of the Microsoft Surface tablets, which should make portable play a lot more stable. There’s also 64GB of internal storage, up from 32GB, and “enhanced audio,” which could just refer to better speakers. Nintendo isn’t getting very specific there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/03704d70-df3e-11eb-bddf-b215b32ed725" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="5007a9b5-8a73-3c44-bdfa-5f8e6622cc14"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>And if you’re really into online multiplayer, you’ll likely appreciate the Ethernet port built into the OLED Switch’s dock. (And if that’s the main draw for you, Nintendo says the dock is also compatible with the old Switch models.) Due to the larger screen, though, Nintendo says the OLED Switch may run into issues with some Labo kits and other games.</p><p>I get it, $350 is a lot to shell out for a slightly better Switch. That’s particularly true when you can get the disc-less PlayStation 5 for $399, or the full PS5 and Xbox Series X for $499. But for Nintendo diehards, the improvements are definitely tempting. Just don’t be surprised if the company ends up dropping the 4K-capable Switch during the 2022 holiday season.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-oled-switch-not-switch-pro-161744624.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97cc4a00-f020-47fd-a967-9f76ef814ff9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 16:17:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681630</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bungie will reveal what's next for 'Destiny 2' on August 24th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Destiny%202"><em><ins>Destiny 2</ins></em></a> fans will soon find out more about the future of the game.

Trump announced the legal bid at a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, promising the case would lead to an &quot;end of the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and the canceling that you know so well.&quot; Trump and his lawyers, many of whom he said come from the tobacco industry, plan to file the lawsuits in the Southern District of Florida and hope to obtain class action status with each one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Trump alleges the tech giants violated his First Amendment rights and even calls Facebook a &quot;state actor&quot; in one of the suits. The lawsuit against Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai names YouTube as a defendant. &quot;Our case will prove this censorship is unconstitutional,&quot; Trump said, adding that he plans to seek punitive damages from each of the companies. The decision to file the suits in Florida may prove an early roadblock for Trump. As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1412795910430527489?s=20"><em>Reuters</em></a>, both the Facebook and Twitter note in their terms of service that any case brought against them must done so at select courts in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the January 6th US Capitol riot, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">Facebook</a> suspended Trump from their respective platforms. &quot;We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,&quot; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. The action comes more than two months after Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board said the company&#39;s suspension of the former president was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">appropriate</a>.&quot; Facebook currently plans to uphold the ban until at least January 2023.

The Linux Foundation will manage the project and form an Open 3D Foundation to foster development. Amazon is a founding member alongside tech heavyweights like Adobe, Huawei, Niantic and Red Hat.</p><p>While the original Lumberyard was based on the Crytek engine, the version you&#39;ll get as Open 3D Engine was rewritten and is free of possible patent headaches, according to Amazon. It also boasts a new, more photorealistic renderer as well as many of the other tools you&#39;d need to build a game or simulation, including an animation system, a content editor and visual scripting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is relatively untouched ground for developers. They don&#39;t always have to pay for engines, but they rarely have full freedom to modify the code for their own ends — and those that do often keep the modifications for themselves. Open 3D Engine not only allows extensive customization, but will encourage creators to contribute to the wider community. That theoretically strengthens the technology and helps it move faster than commercial tech like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html">Unreal Engine</a> and Unity.</p><p>There is a financial incentive for Amazon, though — open source may be its best chance at fostering growth. Amazon hasn&#39;t had much success with in-house games built on Lumberyard, having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-crucible-003348633.html">cancelled <em>Crucible</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-new-world-august-31-202202548.html">delayed <em>New World</em></a>. The shift to Open 3D Engine could spur adoption and encourage studios to use AWS, Twitch and other services that hook into the platform. Amazon could reap the rewards of Open 3D Engine even if its dreams of becoming a AAA game creator never come to pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lumberyard-game-engine-open-source-150615764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4de1c90-ce96-4616-8dc8-2867331543ad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 15:06:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625672877</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T15:48:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still from Amazon's Lumberyard video game.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Lumberyard game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW's futuristic electric scooter is straight out of anime]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we saw <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/11/11/bmw-ce-04-scooter-concept/">BMW&#39;s CE 04 electric scooter concept last year</a>, it looked like something pulled straight out of a science fiction film. Now the company has unveiled the <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0337029EN/the-new-bmw-ce-04">final consumer version of the CE 04</a>, and while it&#39;s lost a bit of the fantastical edge, it still looks like a vehicle that would be right at home in <em>Akira </em>or <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>. Aimed at the urban commuter, the CE 04 features a 10.25-inch LCD screen (that&#39;s bigger than what&#39;s in most cars!), up to 81 miles of range, and a top speed of 75mph. It&#39;ll be available in 2022 for around $16,000. That&#39;s twice the price of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-27-vespa-electric-scooter-on-sale-october-elettrica.html">Vespa Elettrica</a>, but that&#39;s also a far slower vehicle meant for even more casual users.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="ae0e2b5f-818d-4e75-af5e-2fc740d56bbf"/><p>Just looking at the CE 04 makes it clear what BMW is trying to accomplish. It&#39;s a fresh new design that&#39;s meant to entice people who are interested in EVs, but may not have the money or space for an actual electric car. It can charge with a regular power plug or EV cables, and BMW claims it can quick charge after being completely drained in one hour and 40 minutes with a level 3 power connection. Still, even if you don&#39;t have the fanciest charging setup around, BMW says it can juice up in four hours and 20 minutes with a standard household socket.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While we&#39;re still waiting for more details on the CE 04&#39;s pricing and optional accessories, you can expect to see a reduced output model with a range of around 62 miles (100Km). That cheaper model will also spit out between 15hp and 30hp, whereas the standard one can reach up 42hp. Both versions should be well equipped for city traffic though, with the ability to reach 31mph in 2.6 seconds.&nbsp;</p><div id="f3767166ffce432ca6c1c72f14e34ae8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VRmsR-SsRs?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-ce-04-electric-scooter-144505285.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16a32cdd-9585-42af-88c7-12fc8d4a41f2</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:45:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625668804</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T14:40:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grubhub and Yandex bring autonomous deliveries to US college campuses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/grubhub">Grubhub</a> is teaming up with Russian tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/yandex">Yandex</a> to deliver food to students and others on US college campuses with the help of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-yandex-autonomous-delivery-robots-testing-moscow.html">autonomous robots</a>.

Instead of playing mostly by yourself in one historical period, you&#39;d routinely join other players across &quot;multiple settings&quot; that would grow and evolve over time. You&#39;d have a reason to keep playing (and keep paying) for a long time where AC currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-siege-of-paris-dlc-200711445.html">relies heavily on DLC</a> and frequent sequels to stay fresh.</p><p>While there would be individual games tied to <em>Infinity</em> with their own look and feel, they&#39;d all be linked together, the sources said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise">confirmed</a> that <em>Infinity</em> exists, but wouldn&#39;t explain the game in detail. It&#39;s meant to please fans who want a &quot;more cohesive approach&quot; to the game universe, the company said.</p><p>Upheaval at the company might threaten the project, however. Ubisoft recently unified its Montreal and Quebec City teams to help Assassin&#39;s Creed flourish through shared talent. While that could strengthen the quality of each release, Quebec will lead the franchise — a problem when that studio and Montreal have had bitter rivalries at times.</p><p>More importantly, there are concerns Ubisoft hasn&#39;t fully addressed the misconduct claims that led to the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-misconduct-151932648.html">firing its chief creative officer</a> and certain studio leaders. A spokeswoman said Ubisoft had investigated all claims and taken appropriate actions, but <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s contacts said that managers accused of abuse remained in senior roles and that employees were reporting racism and sexism that wasn&#39;t being addressed.</p><p>That, in turn, could limit Ubisoft&#39;s resources for <em>Infinity</em>. While poaching from studios near Ubisoft Montreal is a problem, misconduct claims have also lead to more staffers jumping ship from that location.

You don&#39;t get a 4.5K Retina Display like you do with the latest iMacs, but that&#39;s not a huge deal if you have a monitor that you already love — plus your preferred keyboard and mouse setup as well.</p><p>Aside from its compact size, this Mac Mini&#39;s biggest draw is the new M1 chipset, which has proven to be blazing fast on every machine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">we&#39;ve tested</a> with it. Switching between apps is a breeze, systems wake almost instantaneously and playing Apple Arcade games won&#39;t make the Mac Mini break a sweat. It&#39;s also worth noting that the Mac Mini M1 comes with an 8-core GPU, which is slightly better than the 7-core GPU on the base iMac.</p><p>Apple focused on the internals here, so the exterior design of the Mac Mini hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s still a sleek square on which the back edge houses all of its ports: an Ethernet connector, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 connector, two USB-A ports and a headphone jack. That&#39;s another perk of the Mini when compared to the new iMac, which only has two or four Thunderbolt ports depending on the configuration. Overall, Amazon&#39;s sale is a good opportunity for those with aging desktops to get an M1 machine as a replacement for less.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-sale-600-with-coupon-amazon-124557506.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fbf62f0-8480-4be5-841f-c27066cc6645</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:45:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625661983</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:46:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bentley's Flying Spur Hybrid can travel 25 miles in EV mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bentley-plugin-hybrid-ev-2026-094121635.html">announcing</a> a shift to hybrid and fully electric cars by 2026, Bentley has begun showcasing the existing vehicles getting an eco-friendly makeover. Following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-bentley-bentayga-hybrid-revealed-163000296.html">Bentayga Hybrid</a> SUV, the spotlight is now on the more powerful <a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234">Flying Spur</a> sedan.&nbsp;</p><p>Bentley&#39;s second plug-in hybrid features a 410 break horsepower (bhp) 2.9-liter V-6 with twin turbochargers, paired with a 134 bhp electric motor, for a combined 536 bhp. That&#39;s 95 bhp more than its SUV counterpart. While the luxury vehicle&#39;s 0-60mph acceleration time of 4.1 seconds and top speed of 177mph is just shy of the standard Flying Spur V8.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e8f69fc0-df1b-11eb-bef7-786d6bababbc" alt="Bentley Flying Spur Hybrid" data-uuid="ec36cc6b-432f-36c5-947a-467b955bc850"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bentley</div></figure><p>To improve emissions, the new engine uses fuel injectors and spark plugs centralized within each combustion chamber for &quot;optimal spray patterns.&quot; While the twin-scroll turbos and catalytic converts are positioned within the V of the engine.</p><p>Bentley says the Flying Spur packs a 14.1kWh battery to offer an expected all-electric range of around 25 miles, pending certification. With many city centres requiring hybrids to switch to full EV mode, those figures will be critical. Some car makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fiat-chrysler-plug-in-hybrids-electric-only-mode-161611941.html">Fiat</a> and BMW have even developed tech that can fully switch hybrids to all-electric drive in low emissions zones.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to that feature, Bentley says the hybrid manages battery usage by automatically shifting between three drive modes, including EV, allowing it to store up energy for when you reach the city. The sedan&#39;s combined petrol-electric range is more than 435 miles.</p><p>Visually, little separates the new plug-in hybrid from the rest of Flying Spur range, apart from a charging port on the left rear wing and an understated hybrid badge on the front. As you&#39;d expect, this is a car for the uber-rich. Prices for the Flying Spur Hybrid are expected to start from an eye-watering £160,000 in its native UK, according to <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bentley/flying-spur/355476/new-bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-arrives-536bhp"><em>Auto Express</em></a>, with sales beginning this summer and deliveries to kickstart before the end of the year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-ev-121920123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10d9ea49-5001-4a0f-9a5e-6e03f47b2b3f</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:19:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625660991</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:30:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bentley]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Bentley Flying Spur plug-in hybrid drives down a highway with hills in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bentley Flying Spur]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian hackers breached a GOP contractor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A state-sponsored Russian hacking group infiltrated the computer systems of a Republican National Committee (RNC) contractor over the weekend. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>originally revealed that the RNC suffered a breach at the hands of prolific hackers APT29, aka Cozy Bear, who are believed to be behind a spate of high-profile cyberattacks on the US and its allies.&nbsp;</p><p>However, GOP officials were quick to refute that report, interjecting that the actual victim was a third-party IT services provider known as Synnex.

Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">the OLED Switc</a>h is the most grown-up-looking Switch so far, with smaller bezels, a new off-white dock and matching Joy-Cons. The core upgrade is — shockingly — the screen: a new seven-inch OLED panel that should offer crisper graphics when played as a handheld. However, the resolution hasn’t changed, so it’s been stretched a little wider than the original 6.2-inch LCD Switch.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7c4907c0-df0a-11eb-b7e7-9d56957bd6b0" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="28c45b18-421b-3e11-a8ac-0189c30dd752"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure></a><p>I can run through the rest of the changes, as there aren’t all that many. There’s now 64GB of internal storage — another grown-up upgrade — while a wider, more solid-looking kickstand replaces the flimsy plastic tab on the original Switch. You can adjust this to multiple angles for more comfortable table-top / airplane-tray-table gaming. The new off-white dock also has an Ethernet port built-in, while the core OLED Switch has improved speakers. Otherwise, there’s no newer processor and, seemingly, no battery-life improvements. (The company hasn’t offered any battery estimates yet on its official site.)</p><p>The OLED Switch is not for current Switch owners looking to upgrade — although I don’t doubt some of us will buy one. It’s a refined version of the original (or maybe I’m easily tricked by monochrome color schemes), but seems expressly aimed at handheld players, who are the ones that’ll benefit from the bigger OLED screen. That’s odd when the cheaper, non-hybrid Switch Lite was geared at the same crowd.</p><p>Nintendo could have squashed the more aggressive rumors of a powerful version capable of 4K and upscaled gaming, but it didn’t. Because it’s Nintendo, meaning it has a mercurial vision for hybrid consoles, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-160029843.html">iconic games</a>, detachable controls and, at the same time, ignores Bluetooth audio support and in-game chat functionality. And there was no mention of any changes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-european-union-151738223.html">fix Joy-Con drift</a>.</p><p>If you’re looking for a comparison from console history, consider this a GameBoy Pocket-style twist on the GameBoy, rather than a more powerful PS4 Pro to replace the PS4.</p><p>And will we ever see the 4K-capable Switch Pro? Does it even exist? Only Nintendo knows.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">President Biden will order the FTC to draft &#39;right to repair&#39; rules</a></h2><h3>The policy will probably target farmers more than phone companies.</h3><h3></h3><p>The right to repair movement in the US could soon see a significant breakthrough.
