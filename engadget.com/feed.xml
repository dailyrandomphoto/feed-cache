Unfortunately, America’s decades-long love affair with performing the absolute bare minimum of basic infrastructure maintenance has left many stretches of the nation’s highway lane markers faded, damaged and obscured. A new pilot program from Honda Research Institute USA could one day help local highway and traffic departments keep a closer eye on the state of the roads in their care, using the cars travelling upon them.</p><p>The Honda Road Condition Monitoring System leverages the cameras and GPS navigation systems already found in many of today’s automobiles to monitor the real-time conditions of roads and detect potential hazards. The onboard system will evaluate each stretch of lane marker as green, yellow, grey and red. Green and yellow denote ideal or good quality lane markers, while red indicates markers in need of repair and grey means that there are no markers present at all (like on city streets or rural roads).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7cc48c26503741b28b213e3c9ff1a95b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5DhN1yCYk0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The system captures road conditions using the vehicle’s cameras and other sensors, coordinating that feed with the onboard GPS to provide exact locations of any hazards or damage and then uploads that data to a secure server. Once the data is in the cloud, local highway and transportation departments will be able to access it through a web portal to see which stretches of roadway need to be repaired or repainted most urgently.</p><p>“We regularly inspect our roadways throughout Ohio and act quickly to address any issues, like faded or damaged pavement markings, that are identified. It’s a labor-intensive process. Good pavement markings are important to the drivers of today and the vehicles of tomorrow,” Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks said in a statement Monday. “We’re excited to work with Honda to improve the process.”</p><p>Honda is working with the Ohio Department of Transportation for its upcoming pilot program, which is slated to begin early next year. During that study, obviously only select Honda vehicles will be recording datam, “to help enhance the efficiency of the road maintenance operation in Ohio,” according to a Monday press release. The research institute is looking to eventually connect entire fleets of Honda and Acura vehicles, allowing them to share data via V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) networks and provide real-time updates to their ADA systems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-is-piloting-a-road-monitoring-system-to-spot-faded-lane-markers-141527660.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9030d567-732b-48aa-bcc1-a68f2de71e72</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 14:15:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639421816</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T18:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Luis Sinco via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - NOV. 24, 2021.

With so much of our lives driven by our devices, gadgets that help keep smartphones and tablets going will be useful to almost anyone. Anker makes some of our favorite mobile accessories and Amazon has a one-day-only sale going on that knocks <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:up to 36 percent off" href="https://amzn.to/3dSiZc6">up to 36 percent off</a> some of the company&#39;s latest devices.

The 5,000mAh battery pack will come in handy for those constantly on the go as it snaps to the back of iPhone 13s and provides up to 17 hours of additional juice. It also has a built-in kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while it&#39;s wirelessly charging. We also appreciate that it doesn&#39;t add much heft to the iPhone, measuring just 12.8mm thick, and that you can use it with MagSafe-compatible phone cases, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you know someone who could stand to clean up their nightstand a bit, Anker&#39;s MagGo desktop charging station could do the trick. It looks similar to Amazon&#39;s now-discontinued Echo Spot, but with a powerful magnetic pad instead of a smart display. The orb magnetically holds on to your iPhone, positioning it at an angle that makes it easy to see and use the screen. On its back, it has a bunch of ports: three AC outlets, two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. That lets you plug in almost any other gadget you have lying around like a tablet or your smartwatch, and it keeps all of your cables mostly out of the way. Its small size and cute design make it a good choice as a catch-all charging device for your nightstand or the desk in your home office.</p><p>While the sale mostly includes magnetic accessories, there are a few standard charging gadgets included, too.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/california-halts-ponyais-driverless-testing-permit-after-accident-2021-12-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the DMV suspended its driverless testing permit on November 19th, a few weeks after a reported collision in Fremont. Based on the report filed with the state&#39;s DMV, a Pony.ai vehicle operating autonomously hit a road center divider and a traffic sign on October 28th.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a single vehicle incident, and there were no injuries and other vehicles involved. As <em>Reuters</em> said, it&#39;s unclear what aspect of the accident prompted the DMV to suspend Pony.ai&#39;s permit, but the company said it immediately launched an investigation and is working with the agency to figure out what caused the collision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Pony.ai won&#39;t be able to test fully autonomous vehicles in California anymore, it can continue its trials with safety drivers behind the wheel. The company has 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles registered for testing and only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/">secured</a> its driverless testing permit six months ago for three cities in the state. It&#39;s the eighth company to receive that kind of permit in California, following the likes of Waymo, Cruise and Baidu. Under the terms of the permit, Pony.ai was given permission to conduct driverless tests in Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine on open roads and with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Further, the vehicles could only operate in clear weather and light precipitation.</p><p>Pony.ai recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005790/en/Pony.ai-Receives-Approval-for-Paid-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Services-in-Beijing">received</a> approval to run paid autonomous taxi services in Beijing, which it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">hoping to achieve</a> in California by 2022.

The issue only applies to 2018 and later models, but recently came to light as the free trials of Toyota&#39;s Remote Connect subscription started to expire.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota lets you start vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-rav-4-prime-priced-at-40000-195446077.html">RAV 4 PHEV</a> remotely in two ways. One is over WiFi/LTE using its Remote Connect apps that cost $8 per month or $80 per year. The other is by using the key fob, which requires that you be relatively close to the vehicle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unless they read the fine print, however, owners may not have known that the key fob method was also part of the Remote Connect subscription. Toyota confirmed to <em>The Drive</em> that you&#39;ll need a paid subscription on every 2018 and newer Toyota model to use the function.</p><p>Complicating the situation is that most buyers received a free three-year or 10-year Remote Connect trial depending on whether they had the Audio Plus or Premium Audio trim options. So for at least the first three years of ownership, the remote key fob start method would have worked without a hitch — but it&#39;s now expiring for 2018 models.</p><p>The issue was originally spotted by car shopping site <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/posts/toyota-rav4-remote-start/"><em>CoPilot</em></a> last summer. Owners are particularly irked that Toyota has linked the key fob remote start function to Remote Connect, since the key fob doesn&#39;t require an app in any way. What might be extra galling is that the limitation doesn&#39;t apply to pre-2018 cars, because Toyota didn&#39;t want to update them from 3G to LTE networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota isn&#39;t the first automaker to charge for key features on top of the price of the car. Mercedes also <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/automotive-news/mercedes-benz-eqs-rear-wheel-steer-requires-subscription">requires a subscription</a> in Europe for rear-wheel steering in its new EQS electric car. And after charging buyers a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-bmw-adds-a-80-yearly-subscription-for-apples-carplay.html">monthly fee</a> for Apple CarPlay, BMW <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-04-bmw-apple-carplay-waives-subscription-fee.html">backtracked</a> and included the feature for free.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94790a4c-8b89-4062-b4b4-4659d6123acd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:16:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491117</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:13:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG’s StanbyME is a wireless TV on wheels]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is slated to showcase two lifestyle TVs with unusual designs at CES 2022, one of which is the recently announced premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED Evo TV with motorized cover</a>. The other? It&#39;s a smaller wireless TV with built-in battery called StanbyME that you can roll in and out of any room in your home. The 27-inch display is mounted on a moveable stand with concealed wheels, and you can adjust its height to customize its position for whatever you&#39;re using it for. You can also swivel and rotate its screen to either portrait or landscape orientation.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, LG said that since you can adjust its position as needed, you can use it in your kitchen while cooking or in your bedroom or the sofa while lounging. And you can, unless you&#39;re planning on not getting up for hours to binge on your favorite series — the TV only lasts for three hours of viewing before it needs a recharge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite that limitation, you can use the StanbyME to view whatever content you want using the apps it supports, which include Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video. You can also take advantage of its mobile screen mirroring capability with your Android or iOS phone and NFC. The model has a removable mobile cradle on top, so you can use it to take video calls or attend online classes. Plus, you can use it as a screen for your laptop or PC via wireless connection or by using USB or HDMI.</p><p>The model will come with a remote control you can use for navigation, but it&#39;ll also be able to recognize touch and gesture commands. LG also says that it has a unique US that&#39;s &quot;tailored to the viewer&#39;s personal viewing experience.&quot; The manufacturer didn&#39;t explain what it meant by that, but we&#39;ll find out for sure in January at CES.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868ba710-2568-41b4-906e-1db2b7097d14</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491156</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The other innovation in LGâs new Lifestyle TV lineup, LG StanbyME, is the ideal companion for todayâs TV viewing habits.

Following last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-093038483.html">Oppo AR Glass</a> concept, the new Oppo Air Glass will become available to Chinese consumers in Q1 2022 for a yet-to-be-announced price. It&#39;ll come in two parts: a detachable monocle waveguide device (in black or white) and either a silver half frame or a black full frame. And no, you won&#39;t be able to attach this 30-gram device to your own glasses.</p><div id="f427458c2c774c029fa3ea5e5f2d84ae"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMQUDSk_4B0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Much like Google Glass, Oppo Air Glass is designed to deliver simple information for use cases such as navigation, translation, teleprompter, calendar, weather, fitness tracking and more. Oppo calls this &quot;assisted reality,&quot; which keeps the package portable yet practical and accessible. This is achieved using a power-efficient &quot;Spark Micro Projector,&quot; which comes in at roughly the size of a single coffee bean, and it houses a Micro LED chip to project a bright 640 x 480 image onto a waveguide display — one that&#39;s larger than that of Google Glass.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b4c08b80-5cbb-11ec-bdae-82e193e172f1" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="4337b49e-da54-36c5-b3fc-c29fe8de21a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo Air Glass is driven by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-spaces-ar-xr-platform-163552229.html">Qualcomm</a> Snapdragon Wear 4100, which is similar to the chip inside some of the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a> and TicWatch smartwatches.

However, only Chinese, English and Japanese are supported at the moment, with Korean to follow soon.</p><p>For the navigation app, Oppo worked with Baidu to integrate Baidu Walk &amp; Bike Navigation as well as Explore Nearby. Don&#39;t expect any sophisticated AR graphics here; users will simply see step-by-step navigation based on one&#39;s location and orientation, and voice command is supported (presumably only in Chinese).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6117c000-5cc2-11ec-bfff-b115e4db4904" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="7849d205-bf1d-3b10-98c3-713b96577acc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>An Oppo rep added that the Air Glass is the result of two previous designs, which allowed the company to work with developers to build up an ecosystem. In addition, the Chinese company will soon release a Smart Glass SDK to let more developers — potentially those from overseas as well — into the party.</p><p>Considering how other companies such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-three-new-frames-131152809.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-frames-pacific-blue-quartz-grey-announcement-130020269.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-augmented-reality-spectacles-selfie-drone-190800775.html">Snap</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-review-price-specs-available-now-162556863.html">Razer</a> have been focusing on either audio- or camera-based smartglasses, Oppo&#39;s strategy with its Air Glass is certainly a bit of a surprise. For now, this is all rather experimental for Oppo, as the device will only be launched in China in a limited quantity, with each labelled with a unique edition number on its package.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-air-glass-assisted-reality-wearable-xr-ar-095617424.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06443428-820d-44be-b921-f12f0bc8bd96</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 09:56:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491512</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:18:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oppo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV may lose ESPN, ABC, FX and other Disney channels this week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube TV has warned viewers that channels including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-22-espn-lost-two-million-subscribers.html">ABC, ESPN, FX</a> and others may disappear by 11:59 PM on December 17th if it can&#39;t come to terms with Disney over carriage fees.

Just in case, though, YouTube TV said that users might want to sign up for the $14 Disney Bundle to keep access to ABC and other channels.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube TV launched only recently in April of 2017, but with four million subscribers, it&#39;s become one of the top cord-cutting services along with Disney&#39;s Hulu, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-channels-pulled-youtube-tv-1235061987/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a>.

Now, the footwear and sports apparel giant has acquired a startup called RTFKT (pronounced &quot;artifact&quot;) that will help the company accelerate its &quot;digital transformation.&quot; RTFKT was founded in early 2020 and has since made a name for itself designing and creating what it calls &quot;Metaverse-ready sneakers and collectibles&quot; — all digital goods people pay very real money for.&nbsp;</p><p>The market for virtual goods is booming, and it&#39;s expected to continue growing as we move towards the metaverse, the future vision for the internet wherein people can interact in a virtual world with digital avatars. To that end, Nike seems to have big plans for RTFKT and its team, which will be joining the company. John Donahoe, Nike&#39;s President and CEO, said: &quot;We&#39;re acquiring a very talented team of creators with an authentic and connected brand. Our plan is to invest in the RTFKT brand, serve and grow their innovative and creative community and extend Nike’s digital footprint and capabilities.&quot; On Twitter, the startup <a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios/status/1470502806868140037">said</a> that it &quot;will continue to evolve [its] brand, innovations, products and community with Nike resources and talents.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, RTFKT teamed up with 18-year-old artist Fewocious to release three NFT sneakers for $3,000, $5,000 and $10,000.

In 2022, Amazon reportedly plans to bring the service to the US and the majority of Europe.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment on the specifics of its plans but did share a statement with Engadget. “Our focus is on providing Amazon customers the best possible experience when it comes to grocery delivery whether that is from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, or one of our local stores like Bartell’s in Seattle, Morrison’s in London, or Monoprix in Paris,” a spokesperson for the company said. “Partnerships with other grocers enable more customers to shop online and allow us to provide Amazon Prime members with more choice, value and convenience while our partners benefit from increased visibility for their selection and service.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the service does come to the US, it wouldn’t be Amazon’s first foray into the grocery delivery market.

Depending on the battery size and drive type, prospective buyers should expect to pay between $39,700 and $54,500 for one of their own.</p><p>The Ioniq 5 will be available in three trim levels — SE, SEL, and Limited — and come with either a 77.4kWh pack, which is rated for 303 miles of range using RWD (256 miles with AWD), or a smaller 58-kWh battery with 220 miles of range.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don&#39;t expect to see any of the smaller battery models on US roads to start. Hyundai is initially focusing on producing units with the larger battery pack and saving the 220 mile, 168 HP SE Standard Range until spring 2022. The 303-mile, 225HP rear motor SE starts at $43,650 ($47,150 for the 320 HP, AWD version, the RWD SEL will cost $45,900 ($49,500 for AWD) and the top of the line Limited will go for $50,600 as an RWD ($54,500 for AWD). Optional features and a $1,225 freight charges are of course extra.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyundai&#39;s pricing point puts the Ioniq 5 on par with the 2021 Kia Niro EV, which starts at $39,090, and the 2021 Volkswagen ID.4 with its $39,995 MSRP — even if you splurge for the Ioniq&#39;s higher trim levels, you&#39;ll only begin to stray into, say, the Mach-E&#39;s introductory price range ($42,895 for the base, $48,100 for Premium, and a smooth $60k for a GT).&nbsp;</p><p>Will the Ioniq 5&#39;s performance live up to the hype?

Despite air quality warnings being <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/weather/camp-fire-air-quality-concerns-in-parts-of-northern-california/103-612752864">issued</a> for the city on November 8th, an Amazon warehouse there did not send its workers home until the <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/california-wildfires/article/Amazon-package-delays-Sacramento-closed-smoke-13398895.php">afternoon of the 10th</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>By far, however, the most pervasive issue across Amazon&#39;s warehouses has been extreme heat. Workers in the Pacific Northwest were <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/heat-wave-daily-news-updates-june-27-what-to-know-about-the-heat-dome-across-the-pacific-northwest/#update-13991692">expected</a> to report for duty during a historic heatwave this past summer which was eventually deemed a mass casualty event. Specifically, a worker <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/heat-wave-daily-news-updates-june-27-what-to-know-about-the-heat-dome-across-the-pacific-northwest/#update-13991692">complained</a> that some areas of a warehouse in Kent lacked fans, and estimated temperature inside hit 90 degrees. New York warehouse workers also <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88nv7g/amazon-workers-describe-excessive-heat-fainting-in-nyc-warehouse">reported</a> fainting and excessive heat around the same time. In May of this year, excessive heat led to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-07/amazon-warehouse-worker-dies-in-bessemer-alabama?sref=10lNAhZ9">death</a> inside the company&#39;s Bessemer, Alabama warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>These are only some of the most recent examples. Workers have been lodging similar complaints for at least a <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-xpm-2011-09-23-ct-biz-0923-bf-amazon-heat-20110923-story.html">decade</a> about dangerous temperatures inside Amazon&#39;s facilities in <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-protests-chicago-heat-wave">Chicago</a>, <a href="https://www.opb.org/news/article/amazon-flex-portland-warehouse-working-conditions/">Portland</a> and Pennsylvania&#39;s <a href="https://www.mcall.com/news/watchdog/mc-allentown-amazon-complaints-20110917-story.html">Lehigh Valley</a>, among others. Even when immediate symptoms like fainting, <a href="https://www.kqed.org/science/1934110/rising-heat-is-making-workers-sick">vomiting</a> or heat stroke are not present, long term heat exposure can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-safety-crisis-could-be-heat-waves-1847188930">exacerbate</a> existing health problems such as heart conditions and asthma.&nbsp;</p><p>None of this speaks to criticisms of Amazon&#39;s safety measures related to <a href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/coworkers-react-after-amazon-worker-from-tracy-facility-dies-from-coronavirus/103-20b2999e-c450-4553-89aa-bcb084ba8b02">COVID-19</a>, or its objectively sky-high <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/01/amazon-osha-injury-rate/">injury rate</a> compared to other warehousing operations.</p><p>What&#39;s concerning is that, according to the overwhelming majority of the scientific community, severe winds, rain and heat are likely to get worse due to man-made climate change. Amazon, however, has not offered a satisfactory explanation for why it continues to schedule shifts during potentially deadly weather, nor would it provide Engadget with any details of the extreme weather plan in effect at the Edwardsville facility.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re deeply saddened by the news that members of our Amazon family passed away as a result of the storm in Edwardsville, IL,&quot; an Amazon spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims, their loved ones, and everyone impacted by the tornado. We also want to thank all the first responders for their ongoing efforts on scene.

It was initially scheduled to launch alongside iOS 14, but the company subsequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-app-tracking-delay-191448363.html"><ins>delayed</ins></a> it to give developers more time for implementation.</p><p>The feature was almost immediately controversial with advertisers.

Now, Poland&#39;s competition watchdog is investigating ATT, in part due to antitrust concerns. The regulator contends it &quot;does not mean that users&#39; information is no longer being collected and that they do not receive personalized ads.&quot; At the same time, it says it has concerns Apple may have introduced the feature to promote Apple Search Ads.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;During the course of our investigation, we want to examine whether Apple&#39;s actions may be aimed at eliminating competitors in the market for personalized advertising services, the objective being to better sell their own service,&quot; said Tomasz Chróstny, the President of UOKiK.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Apple for comment.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/13/poland-apple-att-antitrust-probe/"><em><ins>TechCrunch</ins></em></a>, the probe follows a <a href="https://blog.lockdownprivacy.com/2021/09/22/study-effectiveness-of-apples-app-tracking-transparency.html"><ins>recent study</ins></a> from adblocker Lockdown Privacy that questioned the effectiveness of the App Tracking Transparency feature.

When the software finds a nearby AirTag that’s been separated from its owner, it will flag it as an “Unknown AirTag.” If it then follows you for 10 minutes, you can use the app to tell the tracker to play a sound, making it easier to find. At that point, you can tap the device with your NFC-compatible phone and you’ll get instructions on how to remove its battery or otherwise disable it.</p><p>You don’t need an Apple account to use the app. As mentioned above, it can also detect Find My-compatible trackers like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chipolo-one-spot-air-tag-rival-find-my-network-tracker-tagreview-121030666.html"><ins>Chipolo One Spot</ins></a>. “AirTag provides industry-leading privacy and security features and today we are extending new capabilities to Android devices. Tracker Detect gives Android users the ability to scan for an AirTag or supported Find My enabled item trackers that might be traveling with them without their knowledge,” an Apple spokesperson told Engadget. “We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The release of Tracker Detect comes following multiple incidents of bad actors abusing AirTags to stalk people. In Canada, for example, police recently warned of thieves using the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-29-each-find-my-item-tracker-comning-april-30-171736127.html"><ins>$29 device</ins></a> to <a href="https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/apple-tracking-devices-being-used-in-thefts-of-high-end-cars-in-york-region-police-1.5690819"><ins>steal expensive cars</ins></a>. In June, Apple, in a separate effort to limit abuse, updated its trackers to play a sound between eight and 24 hours after they’re separated from their owner, instead of after three days as was the case at launch.</p><p>How much good Tracker Detect does to protect people will depend on how many people download it. Unlike with iOS, which sends proactive warnings when it detects errant AirTags, this is an app you need to install to your Android device. Its protections aren&#39;t built into Android, at least not yet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-detect-tracker-android-release-193850566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">360e54dd-7fd8-49bd-afc1-9eeb89e74987</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 19:38:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639433003</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T22:03:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/da1139a0-5c4a-11ec-8ec5-9e4164e8e3d3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/da1139a0-5c4a-11ec-8ec5-9e4164e8e3d3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Tracker Detect]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Tracker Detect]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple brings SharePlay to macOS Monterey]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s a big firmware day for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple/">Apple</a>.

The idea is to help folks create rich visual content like social media posts, stories, flyers and banners using a straightforward drag-and-drop interface. Along with a fairly generous free plan, there&#39;s a $10 per month or $99 a year premium option.</p><p>The free version includes thousands of templates, fonts and design assets as well as some royalty-free photos. You&#39;ll have access to some basic editing tools and photo effects on the web and mobile, including background removal and animation. You&#39;ll get 2 GB of cloud storage too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While that might be enough for more casual users, professionals might find the premium plan more suitable. Along with everything from the free tier, they&#39;ll get access to all premium design assets and templates (around 50,000, according to a demo), more than 20,000 fonts and all of Adobe&#39;s 160 million+ royalty-free stock images.</p><p>A brand manager will allow paid users to include their logo, branding, colors and fonts with a single tap, which could be a major time saver and help maintain a consistent design language. There are more in-depth editing features, such as graphic groups, resizing and refine cutout. You&#39;ll be able to import and export PDFs and other file types.</p><div id="5b7f130a62d645e7b42d774666130e34"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u3HTATetcxA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There&#39;s integration with Creative Cloud Libraries. All Express assets and templates can be edited and managed across other Creative Cloud apps. You&#39;ll also get 100 GB of storage. In addition, the premium plan includes access to features from other Adobe apps. They include video capture and editing on mobile and desktop (Premiere Rush); combining photos and creating collages (Photoshop Express); video slideshows (Spark Video); and building web pages from text and images (Spark Page).</p><p>Creative Cloud Express uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobe%20sensei/">Adobe Sensei</a>, the same artificial intelligence and machine learning tech behind the company&#39;s core apps, such as Photoshop and Premiere. The framework powers features like the ability to turn videos into GIFs and merging videos. There are also plans to integrate ContentCal, which automates social media publishing and reporting, into Express. Adobe <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/12/08/adobe-to-acquire-content-cal#gs.jah5gu">announced</a> an agreement to buy ContentCal last week.</p><p>Until now, Express had only been available with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobe%20creative%20cloud/">Creative Cloud</a> plans. A standalone version could help Adobe better compete with the likes of Canva, Prezi and Picsart, especially given that there&#39;s a free option.</p><p>Express is included with Creative Cloud All Apps and flagship single-app plans costing at least $20. The suite is free for K-12 as well. Creative Cloud Express is available now <a href="https://www.adobe.com/express/">on the web</a> and as an app from the Microsoft Store, Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Versions for Enterprise and Teams will arrive next year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-creative-cloud-express-spark-multimedia-creation-174256501.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eaca2398-8c3b-4a55-861d-9065dfbc8fba</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:42:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639426592</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T20:16:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3aef90c0-5c3a-11ec-bfdf-287f03cf4b90" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3aef90c0-5c3a-11ec-bfdf-287f03cf4b90" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A series of screenshots showing images created using Adobe Creative Cloud Express.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Creative Cloud Express]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dremel's first smart rotary tool comes with Bluetooth and a brushless motor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dremel is the standard when it comes to rotary tools. DIY enthusiasts use them for everything from standing down a dog&#39;s nails to cutting through steel. If you fall into that category, the company&#39;s latest release, the <a href="https://us.dremel.com/en_US/dremel-press-releases/-/asset_publisher/rSeHpKK9sJI4/content/the-dremel-brand-unveils-the-world-s-first-brushless-smart-rotary-tool?inheritRedirect=false#downloadTarget">8260</a>, is interesting for a few reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, it&#39;s Dremel&#39;s first brushless rotary tool. Thanks to its more modern motor design, Dremel claims the 8260 outputs 20 percent more power than the 4300, its most powerful corded model. Moreover, it features double the battery life of the 8220, its previous flagship cordless model. It&#39;s also 20 percent faster than the 8220.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also Dremel&#39;s first smart tool. The addition of Bluetooth connectivity allows you to connect the 8260 to your phone through Dremel&#39;s mobile app. One of the niftier features here is an interactive guide that will tell you what accessory and RPM you need to use to cut through specific materials. It will also send you battery notifications and warnings if the tool is about to stall or overheat. An LED light on the 8260 will also warn you if you&#39;re about to run into those problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The 8260 is available today through the Home Depot for <a href="https://homedepot.sjv.io/QO0Kd9">$169</a>. The kit comes with three wheels for cutting metal and one designed for plastic, a battery, charger and a carrying case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dremmel-8260-smart-tool-annoucement-170327828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a418c1b-d010-4708-a7e1-0a8eb9377268</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:03:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639415012</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T17:04:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/58bc99e0-5c35-11ec-9ddb-b6a745c4c67b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/58bc99e0-5c35-11ec-9ddb-b6a745c4c67b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dremel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dremel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dremel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket first look: Handheld gaming as good as it ever was]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="0587d197278f4713a0aea0ba5637d7d8"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvWxnWdgvbU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Far too long ago (for our impatient souls), boutique console maker, Analogue, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-16-analogue-pocket-game-boy-advance-game-gear-ngpc-atari-lynx.html">teased something exciting</a>. A retro handheld that mimicked multiple classic systems, including: All the Game Boys, the Sega Game Gear, the Neo Geo Pocket and the Atari Lynx. Oh and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-duo-turbografx-pc-engine-turboduo-fpga-console-150059918.html">recently announced</a>: the TurboExpress, too. In other good news, Analogue also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-orders-reopening-173447693.html">just announced</a> that orders for the Pocket will open again on December 14th (tomorrow). The slightly less good news is that at $220, it&#39;ll cost $20 more than originally planned, but you can blame the virus for that and its impact on supply chains.</p><p>Finally, it’s here and it’s… still just as exciting. So much so that the short time I&#39;ve had with the Pocket isn&#39;t enough to give it the deep dive review it deserves. You have to remember, this thing not only plays old games from original cartridges. It does so using a party trick called field-programmable gate arrays (or FPGA). All you need to know is that FPGAs effectively mimic old consoles at the hardware level. When you plug in a game, it thinks it’s in an original Game Boy (or whichever system for the relevant adapter you might be using). Couple that with a display custom-designed to replicate vintage screens, quirks and all, and this has all the ingredients to be the most authentic retro handheld you can find. Our early testing with Game Boy (original) and Game Boy Advance games indicates this really is one of the most authentic experiences you can find.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pretty much the moment you pick this thing up you know you’re in for a treat. If the original Game Boy had been released today with a Scandinavian design, this is what it would look like. The clean lines and monochrome aesthetic tell you this is all about the game; there are no garish colors of cliche nods to the &#39;90s here. Just one dash of color on the left-hand side for the power button and that’s as flashy as things get.</p><p>The general layout broadly matches the first-gen and Game Boy color, with the screen up top and controls underneath. Though there are four thumb buttons instead of two as you’ll be able to create games for this yourself either with GB Studio or via the spare FPGA core Analogue added just for developers. There are shoulder buttons, too, as per the Game Boy advance.</p><p>Fortunately, the display is thoroughly modern and not like the squinty, if much loved, one from back in 1989. It’s also handily 10 times the resolution on both axes so it can serve up pixel-perfect renditions of your favorite original Game Boy titles. The way it reproduces original Game Boy games is quite remarkable.</p><p>Turn the Pocket on and the minimalist interface leads you straight to the good stuff: Playing games.</p><p>I won’t lie, firing up Tetris for the first time and changing the Pockets display mode to the original green-and-black game boy mode was quite the dash of nostalgia. I’ve played Game Boy games on several “modern” handhelds and none of them looked like this. Even the pixel grid of the original is here, the motion blur (if you want it), the sound. Everything felt just as it did all those years ago.</p><p>The same goes for Game Boy Advance games. If you ever owned the first model of GBA, you’ll (painfully) remember that it still didn’t have a lit screen. The Pocket does, but everything else matches, including a preset for that slight washed-out look that comes with just colors on a non-illuminated LCD. You can, of course, choose a more modern display mode if you like, but purists are going to love the attention to detail here.</p><p>The authenticity doesn’t stop at the fidelity of the games. The “link” port on the Pocket happens to be the same as the one found on the Game Boy Color and onwards. That means if you have the original hardware (or another Pocket) you can play with friends just like you would have back in the proverbial day. I <em>do</em> have the original hardware, and we’re testing those features right now which you’ll see in our full review.</p><p>In terms of compatibility, so far the only glitch we&#39;ve had is with a very unofficial Game Boy Advance multicart, everything else has worked a charm — including fund stuff like the Game Boy Camera. The same goes for Game Gear titles, which is the only other platform we can try right now.</p><p>There’s so much more to cover here we kinda can’t wait to show you it all. There’s the dock accessory for playing on a TV with real controllers, there’s the aforementioned music-making app, there’s Analogue’s own operating system which hides more than a few perks and then there are the adapters for all the other consoles.</p><p>For now, we’re excited to say that the Pocket appears to deliver on its key promises. The hardware feels fantastic and we keep going back for more Tetris even when it&#39;s way past our bedtime. You’ll just have to wait a few more days for our comprehensive review.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-first-look-handheld-gaming-as-good-as-it-ever-was-160050430.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebcd820c-f9eb-4a76-8eb7-1cc80c4579ad</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 16:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639416837</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T17:34:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8910c3b0-5c02-11ec-9ffc-1ae2dddcfdb7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8910c3b0-5c02-11ec-9ffc-1ae2dddcfdb7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket first look.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket first look]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rihanna, Migos and more are getting official metaverse avatars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Universal Music Group is hitching its wagon more firmly to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html"><ins>metaverse hype train</ins></a>.
