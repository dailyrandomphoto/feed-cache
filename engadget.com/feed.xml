It has a 6.45-inch, 431 PPI external display with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio.

Its 160.4mm tall case houses a 4,750mAh battery that supports 66W charging. Honor says you can fully charge the battery in 40 minutes or to 50 percent of its capacity in just 15 minutes.</p><p>The phone has five cameras in total. The rear three-camera array has a wide camera, ultra wide camera and what Honor calls a &quot;spectrum enhanced camera.&quot; All three are 50MP sensors. There&#39;s a 42MP selfie camera for each screen too.</p><p>The Magic V runs on Qualcomm&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html"><ins>Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</ins></a> chipset, which has a 5G modem and Adreno 730 GPU built in. The Magic V has 12GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, dual-SIM support and stereo speakers. It uses Honor’s new Magic UI 6.0, which is based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-smartphones-google-apps-50-series-huawei-171758485.html"><ins>Android 12</ins></a>. There&#39;s also an independent security chip, which stores passwords and biometric data such as fingerprints.</p><p>The device has three color options: black, space silver and burnt orange. At 293g, the silver and black models weigh slightly more than the 288g orange variant. The Magic V will only be available in China at the outset. The 256GB model costs ¥9,999 (approximately $1,568) while the 512GB version is ¥10,999 (around $1,725). The Magic V will go on sale on January 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-v-foldable-smartphone-153214121.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2edaca1a-5999-4657-9019-555c96559da9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:32:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641828754</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T15:32:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTags are cheaper than usual in Woot's latest one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AirTags are some of the most affordable Apple gadgets you can get, which is probably why deep discounts on them are hard to come by. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html">Last week</a>, we saw one of the trackers drop to $24 and a four-pack fall to $96 on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3qdSW6p">Amazon</a>, but Woot&#39;s latest flash sale makes the bundle even cheaper. Today only, you can get a four-pack of AirTags for $94, which is five percent off its normal price. Woot&#39;s dropped the price to as low as $88 in the past, but that all-time low happened during the holiday shopping season, making it unlikely to come back around anytime soon.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3r2guKG" id="94c702aa8ef34397a86ac655d9b356dc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Woot;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy AirTags (4-pack) at Woot - $94</a><p>Much like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Tile devices" href="https://amzn.to/3Gd30lr">Tile devices</a> and other Bluetooth trackers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are designed to help you keep track of your stuff. The coin-sized gadget can slip into your wallet or backpack, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">attach to a holder</a> that you can clip to your keys, allowing you to keep track of your things using the Find My app on your iOS device. When you do misplace something, you can force the AirTag to emit a chime or, if you have an ultra-wideband supporting iPhone, the Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your missing stuff using directions on your phone&#39;s screen. And if you&#39;re not the in vicinity of your belongings anymore, you can check out the AirTag&#39;s last location in the Find My app and even turn on Lost Mode, which will ping you when the AirTag gets detected by the network again.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Keep in mind that you&#39;ll have to be an iPhone user to get the most out of AirTags. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-detect-tracker-android-release-193850566.html">recently released an app</a> that allows Android users to see if an AirTag is nearby, but its goal is detection, privacy and returning the lost AirTag to its rightful owner.

That&#39;s where the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Pro M1" href="https://amzn.to/334Nk5A">MacBook Pro M1</a> comes in, and Amazon has the 2020 model for a bit less than usual. The 13-inch laptop with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $150 off right now, bringing it down to $1,150. Only the space gray model has this discount right now, but the silver version is $100 off and down to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$1,199" href="https://amzn.to/3qbWTZi">$1,199</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/334Nk5A" id="a1e8c4797c0445f386e120220cb18bf0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Pro M1 at Amazon - $1,150</a><p>Keep in mind that this is the 2020 model — not the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2021 MacBook Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3zHNPyd">2021 MacBook Pro</a>, which features an updated design with more ports and Apple&#39;s higher-end M1 Pro or M1 Max chipsets. That&#39;s not to say the 2020 model doesn&#39;t have its merits. In fact, it earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">score of 84</a> from us when we first reviewed it thanks to its speedy performance, fast GPU, lovely display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad plus its long, 16.5-hour battery life. And since the Pro is unlike the Air and has a fan inside, it can handle sustained workloads like video encoding better.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few downsides to the Pro M1, namely its support for only one external display and lack of external GPU support all together. And, when compared to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">2021 models</a>, the port selection is lacking. The 2020 laptop only has four Thunderbolt ports, whereas you&#39;ll get connectors like an HDMI port, an SD card slot and more on the newer machine. However, those updated MacBook Pros start at $1,999, so this sale on the 2020 MacBook Pro is a good option for those who have a tighter budget but still want an upgraded laptop and feel comfortable skipping the extra ports.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2020-macbook-pro-m1-is-150-off-at-amazon-134059747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">174574bc-1977-47e1-a66b-41e87d0c3b8a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:40:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641822060</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:41:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take-Two is acquiring mobile game giant Zynga for $12.7 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PC gaming Giant Take-Two has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220110005389/en/Take-Two-and-Zynga-to-Combine-Bringing-Together-Best-in-Class-Intellectual-Properties-and-a-Market-Leading-Diversified-Mobile-Publishing-Platform-to-Enhance-Positioning-as-a-Global-Leader-in-Interactive-Entertainment">announced</a> that it&#39;s making a big move into mobile gaming with the acquisition of Zynga for a total price of approximately $12.7 billion. Take-Two already owns Rockstar Games, Codemasters and 2K, producing games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, <em>Bioshock</em> and others. Zynga, meanwhile, produces well-known mobile titles like <em>CSR Racing</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/farmville-shutting-down-december-31-134117646.html"><em>FarmVille</em></a>, and <em>Words with Friends</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Take-Two said that the deal will result in $6.1 billion worth of 12-month pro-forma net bookings, meaning it will become one of the largest gaming companies in the world. &quot;This strategic combination brings together our best-in-class console and PC franchises, with a market-leading, diversified mobile publishing platform that has a rich history of innovation and creativity,&quot; said Take-Two Chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick. The deal will also help Take-Two save about $100 million annually after two years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zynga itself was on an acquisition streak of late, having acquired the studio behind <em>Torchlight 3</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zynga-echtra-games-185252730.html">early last year</a>. Zynga has sometimes relied on acquisitions to find the hottest games in the notoriously fickle mobile gaming market. Still, Take-Two said that the mobile industry booked $136 billion 2021 and is currently growing at over 8 percent, so the money is there to be had. Mobile will now account for half of its net bookings (net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically), the company said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/take-two-is-acquiring-mobile-game-giant-zynga-131758269.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a891ca4-ce25-4c66-a824-d8237a713b6f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:17:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820701</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:18:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Zynga logo is pictured at the company's headquarters in San Francisco, California April 23, 2014.

Each time someone starts their car, the clock resets — even if they manually set it beforehand.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-2002-gps-bug-190248626.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-second-generation-speaker-193506498.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">IKEA and Sonos refresh their Symfonisk bookshelf speakers</a></h2><h3>Faster processors, updated button layout and longer power cables.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-second-generation-speaker-193506498.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f216ad40-7208-11ec-bb9e-c5311af7a566" alt="TMA" data-uuid="0196cfa4-a309-3d0a-b233-7d1aafdd966a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure></a><p>IKEA and Sonos have released a second-generation version of their Symfonisk bookshelf speaker.

Now, astronomers have <a href="https://www.keckobservatory.org/dying-star/">captured</a> a red supergiant before, during and after a supernova explosion for the first time, gathering <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac3f3a#apjac3f3af1">crucial new information</a> about these dramatic events.</p><p>&quot;This is a breakthrough in our understanding of what massive stars do moments before they die,&quot; said lead author Wynn Jacobson-Galán (UC Berkeley). &quot;Direct detection of pre-supernova activity in a red supergiant star has never been observed before in an ordinary Type II supernova. For the first time, we watched a red supergiant star explode!&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="59f074cb06f64ba2ac863dff799ded24"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/tR8a9Nm" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Using the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-20-pan-starrs-data.html">Pan-STARRS</a> telescope in Maui, Hawai&#39;i, scientists detected the doomed red supergiant star in the summer of 2020 thanks to the huge amount of light it was emitting. Later in the fall when it went supernova, the team captured the powerful flash using the Hawai&#39;i-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-31-keck-observatory-exoplanet-imager.html">Keck Observatory</a>&#39;s Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS). They also captured the very first spectrum of the supernova, known as SN 2020tlf.</p><p>The observations showed that the star likely ejected massive amounts of dense circumstellar material just ahead of the explosion. Previous observations showed that red giants were relatively calm before going supernova, so the new data suggests that some may change their internal structure significantly before exploding. That could then result in tumultuous gas ejections moments before collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>SN 2020tlf is located in the NGC 5731 galaxy about 120 million light-years from Earth and was about 10 times more massive than the Sun. Stars go supernova when they run out of fuel and collapse on their own gravity, fueling a massive carbon fusion explosion. For that to happen, they must be large enough (8 to 15 solar masses) or they&#39;ll simply collapse into white dwarf star like our Sun eventually will. Any larger than that and they could collapse into a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-19-black-hole-image-jean-pierre-luminet.html">black hole</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The discovery will now allow scientists to survey red supergiant stars looking for similar types of luminous radiation that could signal another supernova. &quot;Detecting more events like SN 2020tlf will dramatically impact how we define the final months of stellar evolution... in the quest to solve the mystery on how massive stars spend the final moments of their lives,&quot; said Jacobson-Galán.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scientists-see-a-red-giant-star-go-supernova-for-the-first-time-104442583.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c7b9d3b-a6d4-4899-90c2-e075f4f7ebc2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 10:44:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820635</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:17:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/89cb2950-7217-11ec-bfff-4c9e0dc2a850" width="2300" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/89cb2950-7217-11ec-bfff-4c9e0dc2a850" width="2300" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Keck Observatory]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Scientists see a red giant star go supernova for the first time.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Red giant star supernova]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla 'Full Self-Driving' beta features an 'Assertive' mode with rolling stops]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Profiles are back in Tesla&#39;s latest &quot;Full Self-Driving&quot; beta 10.3 with an &quot;Assertive Mode&quot; that may perform rolling stops and other borderline maneuvers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22875382/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-assertive-profile"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

University of Minnesota Twin Cities researchers have <a href="https://cse.umn.edu/college/news/researchers-develop-first-fully-3d-printed-flexible-oled-display">developed</a> what they say is the first fully 3D-printed flexible OLED display. In theory, you wouldn&#39;t have to depend on panels made at large, distant factories to build or repair your gadgets.</p><p>The new approach combines two methods of 3D printing to print the six layers needed for a functional display. The team used extrusion printing to make the electrodes, encapsulation, insulation and interconnects, while active layers were spray-painted at room temperature. Past attempts by various teams either had issues with light uniformity (consistency across the whole panel) or relied on techniques beyond 3D printing to put some components in place, such as spin-coating or thermal evaporation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prototype was just 1.5 inches wide and used just 64 pixels. Any practical uses would require much higher resolutions (a 1080p display requires over 2 million pixels), and the scientists also want to improve brightness. It might also take a while to adapt the technology for home use. The university used a custom 3D printer that costs as much as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">Tesla Model S</a> — it might take a while for the method to be viable on off-the-shelf printers, even including high-end models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/formlabs-3plus-3bplus-new-esd-resin-170038287.html">FormLabs&#39; $4,850 3B+</a>.</p><p>The very nature of the technology makes those goals relatively achievable, though, and opens the door to numerous possibilities if and when home-printed OLED displays are practical. On top of do-it-yourself repairs, this could help you build homebrew gadgets with custom screens. While this effort doesn&#39;t quite represent the democratization of tech manufacturing (there are many more parts than displays, after all), it could reduce your dependence on companies&#39; pre-assembled components.</p><div id="1fd9e8d06c8c457394ecbc16f94205a2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7KV_lOIp8o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/full-3d-printed-flexible-oled-display-220930099.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecd6166a-2589-49c0-a3d7-614ad2845580</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 22:09:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820311</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8b3ff7d0-718f-11ec-9a3f-84ee75f2f933" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8b3ff7d0-718f-11ec-9a3f-84ee75f2f933" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[McAlpine Group, University of Minnesota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D-printed flexible OLED display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[3D-printed flexible OLED display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roblox halts service in China ahead of a major revamp]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Roblox may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-british-fashion-council-is-giving-an-award-for-the-best-roblox-design-132423514.html">enjoying success</a> in many parts of the world, but it&#39;s currently in limbo in China. <em>TechCrunch</em>  has <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/06/roblox-transition-china-luobulesi-tencent/">learned</a> Roblox temporarily shut down the Chinese version of its game platform, LuoBuLeSi, on December 8th for some &quot;important transitory actions&quot; needed to develop a future version.

Its role as a creative platform could easily draw concern from Chinese censors worried about dissent, and the attempt to pitch LuoBuLeSi as a digital education system may have invited attention from officials cracking down on private education. China&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-passes-personal-information-protection-law-182326563.html">data protection rules</a> could also have contributed to the decision by dictating where and how Roblox stores users&#39; information.</p><p>Whatever the reasons, the temporary halt underscores the difficulties foreign game developers have in China.

According to the latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> from <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman, Apple has rejected the idea of a metaverse (in this case, an all-virtual world) for its long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vr-ar-headset-rumors-141606384.html">mixed reality headset</a>. The very idea is &quot;off limits,&quot; Gurman&#39;s sources claimed. The focus would be on short stints of communication, content viewing and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-vr-games-160752822.html">gaming</a>.</p><p>Past rumors have hinted headset could debut as soon as this year, although its specs and target audience aren&#39;t certain. Early scoops suggested it might have a resolution of 8K per eye, over a dozen &quot;inside out&quot; tracking cameras and a developer focus that included a $3,000 price. Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has suggested the headset would &#39;only&#39; use 4K displays and six to eight cameras, however, hinting at a more affordable device.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the claim is true, Apple&#39;s approach to mixed reality would be very different than that of its rival Meta. Where Meta has shifted its AR and VR strategies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html">toward the metaverse</a>, Apple appears determined to avoid  it. Whether or not that strategy could work is another matter. Apple&#39;s reported strategy could pay off if metaverses struggle, and might thwart Meta&#39;s plans by limiting overall interest in virtual worlds. If metaverses do succeed, though, Apple could miss out and find itself supporting others&#39; VR environments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-no-metaverse-for-vr-headset-182544991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c052dd2-fc2f-43f7-be6d-d460b1480bc4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 18:25:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641753226</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T18:33:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Apple employee helps a member of the media try on an HTC Vive while testing the virtual reality capabilities of the new iMac during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Josh Edelson        (Photo credit should read JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-APPLE-DEVELOPERS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK watchdog to grill Meta over child safety in VR]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta is facing more scrutiny over its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democratic-lawmakers-cancel-instagram-kids-184621575.html">approach to child safety</a>. The UK&#39;s Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) told <em>The Guardian</em> in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/09/uk-data-watchdog-seeks-talks-with-meta-over-child-protection-concerns">statement</a> that it was planning &quot;further discussions&quot; with Meta about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a> VR headset&#39;s compliance with a recently established children&#39;s code that priorities the &quot;best interests&quot; of young users. The watchdog wants to determine whether Meta&#39;s headset and VR services do enough to protect the privacy and data of kids.</p><p>Baroness Beeban Kidron, who developed the code, was concerned Meta&#39;s platform made it too easy for kids to sign on and risk abuse, harassment and explicit content. Meta might require a Facebook account (and thus that a user be at least 13 years old), but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s implementing the code&#39;s required age checks. Children can jump into potentially dangerous VR chatrooms just by &quot;ticking a box&quot; to say they&#39;re old enough, Kidron said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Meta spokesperson told <em>The Guardian</em> the internet giant was &quot;committed&quot; to honoring the children&#39;s code, and was &quot;confident&quot; its VR hardware met the code&#39;s requirements. The representative stressed that terms of service don&#39;t allow children under 13 to use the products, but didn&#39;t address worries it was too easy for kids to ignore that policy. The firm has already promised a $50 million program to make sure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> development obeyed laws and regulations.</p><p>The UK could deliver a wide range of punishments if the ICO finds Meta violated the code. While officials might do little more than issue a warning, they could also fine Meta either a fixed amount up to £17.5 million (about $23.8 million) or as much as 4 percent of its worldwide turnover — over $10 billion. There&#39;s at least some pressure on Meta to toughen child safety in VR, even if it&#39;s just to protect the company&#39;s finances.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-watchdog-meta-vr-child-safety-165358686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28da1309-e716-4f5e-b436-ade8ef8b1185</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 16:53:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641747239</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T16:54:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly unveil an iPhone SE with 5G this spring]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple might use its now-customary spring event to update its most affordable smartphone. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> that Apple is expected to introduce a third-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-review-2020-cheap-a13-bionic-399-130014174.html">iPhone SE</a> this spring through a virtual presentation &quot;likely&quot; happening in March or April. In an echo of past rumors, Gurman understood the new SE would still cling to the iPhone 8-era design but add 5G and a new processor — possibly the A15 from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>, if Apple&#39;s history of using last year&#39;s high-end chip is any indication.</p><p>There was no mention of other changes. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Apple increased the storage to 128GB or updated the camera sensors (again borrowed from the iPhone 8), but those aren&#39;t guaranteed given Apple&#39;s low-cost focus for the iPhone SE. A larger battery might be necessary to compensate for 5G&#39;s typically higher energy drain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the leak is accurate, the new iPhone SE would be disappointing for those wanting a modern nearly-all-screen design. You&#39;d still have a relatively small screen, thick bezels and a button-based fingerprint reader. As we just mentioned, though, price is everything for the SE. The current model&#39;s $399 price helps Apple reach some customers who otherwise couldn&#39;t justify an iPhone. The company might not want to do anything that could prompt even a small a price hike, if just to maximize the SE&#39;s potential audience.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">309de2bc-5e0a-4a4e-bb8c-fd13fda84276</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 15:13:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641741233</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T15:14:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mars Perseverance halts rock sample storage due to debris]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html">Mars Perseverance rover&#39;s sample collection</a> has run into a snag.

Astronomers will use the point to study infrared light without interference, potentially offering insights into the early Universe that aren&#39;t possible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">with Hubble</a> and other equipment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>First images from the telescope won&#39;t be available until the summer, and it could take much longer before those images translate to meaningful discoveries. Even so, the deployment is an achievement. JWST represents the first time NASA has unpacked a complex observatory in space — it shows projects like this are viable, even if they&#39;re unlikely to be commonplace in the near future.</p><div id="3d8a3eec247448f794cb09971f3deb70"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NASAWebb?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NASAWebb</a> is fully deployed! 🎉<br><br>With the successful deployment &amp; latching of our last mirror wing, that&#39;s:<br>50 major deployments, complete.<br>178 pins, released.<br>20+ years of work, realized.<br><br>Next to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UnfoldTheUniverse?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#UnfoldTheUniverse</a>: traveling out to our orbital destination of Lagrange point 2! <a href="https://t.co/mDfmlaszzV">pic.twitter.com/mDfmlaszzV</a></p>— NASA Webb Telescope (@NASAWebb) <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAWebb/status/1479880178021060609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-deployed-203919497.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4e1ff2f-4e14-4204-b084-7662d15d5c8b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 20:39:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641820842</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:20:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4726b920-70be-11ec-ba74-3ba5dc115dd9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4726b920-70be-11ec-ba74-3ba5dc115dd9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA GSFC/CIL/Adriana Manrique Gutierrez]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[James Webb Space Telescope after deployment]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[James Webb Space Telescope after deployment]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ford tries to fight F-150 Lightning scalpers by banning resales]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ford is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-doubling-f-150-lightning-production-150000-vehicles-per-year-110034432.html">swamped with F-150 Lightning orders</a>, and it&#39;s taking special steps to make sure the electric pickup truck reaches honest-to-goodness buyers. <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-f-150-lightning-customers-reselling-trucks-scalpers/">reports</a> Ford is now <a href="https://www.f150gen14.com/forum/threads/ford-warns-dealers-against-additional-deposit-payment-requirements-for-lightning-orders-supports-no-resale-provisions-in-purchase-contracts.7961/">giving</a> dealerships the option to ban customers from reselling the Lightning for up to a year after purchase.

It&#39;s not clear how close this will hew to the original graphic novels, but creator Bryan Lee O&#39;Malley and 2010 movie director Edgar Wright will be executive producers.</p><p>O&#39;Malley will serve as a showrunner alongside <em>Are You Afraid of the Dark?</em> reviver BenDavid Grabinski.

Both the graphic novels and the movie were nods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">manga</a>, indie rock, video games and turn-of-the-millennium Canadian culture.</p><p>This is a slightly unusual twist on a familiar formula. While Netflix hasn&#39;t been shy about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html">ambitious anime plans</a>, it has typically focused on originals or adaptations of Japanese <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-anime-014631924.html">games</a> and manga. Here, the streaming service is adapting a comic that was a Western tribute — and one that many might only know from the big screen. Netflix&#39;s strategy isn&#39;t clear, but it might see this as a way to expose its anime catalog to a larger audience.</p><div id="84f53c74819444f8804382789016c155"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb3TWNzMSr0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scott-pilgrim-netflix-anime-series-173848944.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">402f1643-751d-4922-bee5-7c21a05e718a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:38:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641663529</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T17:39:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bryan Lee O'Malley/Oni Press]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google and Ford want to bring small radar to more devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Radar might soon find its way into more personal technology than Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">phones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">smart speakers</a>. <em>9to5Google</em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/06/google-soli-radar-ripple/">notes</a> Google, Ford and four other partners have <a href="https://cta.tech/ripple">published</a> specs for a Ripple standard that could bring small radar to more devices in a &quot;privacy-respecting&quot; fashion.

In a <a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward">post</a> by company CEO Ben Bear, he said Spin has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872768/ford-e-scooter-company-spin-pulling-out-cities-limit-competition-open-vendor">winding down</a> its operations in a few markets in the US, as well as in the entirety of Germany and Portugal.

Specifically, in places where cities and campuses &quot;select partners through a competitive procurement process.&quot; Apparently, Spin gets double the revenue in those types of places compared to locations with a free-for-all market. Shifting its focus to those places makes sense in that case, but shutting down locations unfortunately also means that the company is letting personnel go: Its move will affect a quarter of its staff, who&#39;ll get severance packages and a stipend.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-e-scooter-company-spin-leaving-markets-laying-off-staff-154545440.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3608d9bd-1d28-417e-bf20-32bf8c87a3e7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 15:45:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641655696</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T15:28:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2af822c0-708c-11ec-bffd-fc6b7d129a56" width="1600" height="1006" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2af822c0-708c-11ec-bffd-fc6b7d129a56" width="1600" height="1006" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mobile sports betting is now legal in New York State]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now use your phone to bet on sports if you live in New York. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/08/mobile-sports-betting-goes-live-in-new-york.html">reports</a> the state has legalized mobile sports betting as of January 8th.

It tells the story of Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), a teen who finds out she turns into a red panda when she gets too excited. Naturally, all sorts of hijinks ensue as a result. Did we mention the fabulous Sandra Oh is also in the movie?
