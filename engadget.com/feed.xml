The company said the model has &quot;the most comprehensive sound&quot; among its true wireless earbuds, and we did find its sound to have real depth and solid clarity. The buds have active noise cancellation and their ear tips are effective enough in sealing off the ear canal to block out constant background noise.

That could help fix OLED&#39;s biggest flaw next to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-neo-qled-mini-led-160021037.html">mini LED</a> technology, namely a lack of overall brightness.&nbsp;</p><p>As LG Display points out, each OLED pixel emits light independently, meaning it can be fully on or off. That allows TVs to show perfect blacks with no &quot;blooming&quot; seen on LED TVs, but at the same time, OLED pixels can&#39;t hit the same brightness levels as LEDS. Current OLED sets can display peak brightness levels up to around 500-600 nits, while mini LED sets can hit 2,000 nits and higher.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7055bce0-688c-11ec-b6ef-98d09ce8bbf2" style="height:1737;width:2700;" alt="LG Display Unveils Next-Generation OLED TV Display &#39;OLED EX&#39;" data-uuid="178eb822-4f3a-348d-911c-775c425d3589"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG Display</div></figure><p>To make OLED sets brighter, OLED EX (Evolution/eXperience) uses deuterium compounds to allow the light-emitting diodes to emit stronger light. &quot;When stabilized, the deuterium compounds allow the display to emit brighter light while maintaining high efficiency for a long time,&quot; LG Display said.&nbsp;</p><p>OLED EX also allows for improved color accuracy. It apparently uses algorithms to predict the usage of 33 million OLED diodes in an 8K display, so it &quot;precisely controls the display&#39;s energy input to more accurately express the details and colors of the video content being played.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company also upgraded its designs, reducing thickness by 30 percent and bezel size from 6 to 4 mm on 65-inch OLED displays. The company didn&#39;t say yet when it plans to bring the technology to market, but it noted that OLED sales increased 70 percent last year despite a 12 percent decline in the global TV market. &quot;With our new OLED EX technology, we aim to provide even more innovative, high-end customer experiences through the evolution of our OLED technology, algorithms and designs,&quot; said LG Display&#39;s Dr. Oh Chang-ho.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a24479a7-30bd-4850-b3f7-f92109dad984</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 09:58:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640771898</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T09:58:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b559aff0-687c-11ec-89ff-2e6187f11de4" width="2000" height="1368" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b559aff0-687c-11ec-89ff-2e6187f11de4" width="2000" height="1368" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG's next-gen 'OLED EX' supposedly enhances brightness up to 30 percent]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG's next-gen 'OLED EX' supposedly enhances brightness up to 30 percent]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Waymo will add custom-built EVs by Chinese company Geely to its robotaxi fleet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the future, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">Waymo&#39;s</a> robotaxi fleet in the US will feature electric vehicles build specifically for the service by Chinese automaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renault-geely-hybrid-joint-venture-china-south-korea-142131019.html">Geely</a>.

For 140 years, scientists have been unwilling to unwrap the king’s body out of fear they’ll damage his ornate face mask and bandages. But thanks to computer tomography (CT) technology, they don’t have to take that risk anymore. Researchers at Cairo University recently <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.778498/full">digitally “unwrapped”</a> Amenhotep to learn about his life and dynasty.</p><p>The scans revealed he was about 35 years old when he died. &quot;Amenhotep I seems to have physically resembled his father: he had a narrow chin, a small narrow nose, curly hair, and mildly protruding upper teeth,&quot; Dr. Sahar Saleem, the lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59808883">told <em>PA Media</em></a>. It’s not clear why he passed away at such a young age. Researchers found no evidence of external wounds or disfigurements that may have contributed to his death.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a0094c70-6802-11ec-a93e-f5ffc7fde7df" alt="Amenhotep I" data-uuid="353bf3c0-ab53-329f-ba8f-23b55bd85745"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sahar Saleem et al. </div></figure><p>What they did discover were various post-mortem injuries that were likely inflicted on the body by grave robbers. That damage was “lovingly repaired” by mortuary priests of the 21st Dynasty some 400 years after Amenhotep’s death. They used a resin-treated linen band to reattach the head and neck together. Researchers also found some 30 amulets hidden among Amenhotep’s bandages. The fact they were still there even after his reburial likely disproves the long-held theory that priests of later dynasties would reuse the ornaments in the funeral rites of their pharaohs.</p><p>The study provides an insight into one of the most fascinating periods of Egyptian history. Amenhotep I ruled between 1525 and 1504 BCE, during Egypt’s New Kingdom period. He was among the first pharaohs of the 18th dynasty, a lineage that would later include Akhenaten, the controversial “heretic” pharaoh who introduced the kingdom to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenism">monotheistic-like religion</a> centered around the sun. He was also the father of Tutankhamun or King Tut.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time archaeologists used a CT scan to examine a mummy was in 1977. As the technology has matured and become more accessible, it has allowed researchers to study mummies in ways they couldn’t before. In 2017, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-20-mummies-museum.html">Chicago’s Field Museum</a> was able to dive into its collection, one of the most extensive in the US, with the help of portable CT scanners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amenhotep-ct-scan-204504392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7f8e82e-2237-43f3-8ef4-e225eb937b83</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 23:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640722710</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T20:18:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[History]]></category><category><![CDATA[Anthropology & Archaeology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sahar Saleem et al. ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China says its space station dodged Starlink satellites twice this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers aren&#39;t the only ones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-sunshades-162340057.html">taking issue with SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellites</a>.

As <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/hyundai-shuts-down-engine-development-team-focus-electric-cars/">reports</a>, <em>Korea Economic Daily</em><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202112230013?lang=us">sources</a> claim Hyundai shut down its research center&#39;s engine design unit sometime this month. There will still be some workers left to refine existing engines, but the rest will move to EV-related work.</p><p>The company is understood to be converting buildings for EV development at the same time. The powertrain development center is becoming an electrification test facility, and the performance development center is now dedicated to electrified machines. There&#39;s also a new battery development center, while researchers are now sourcing raw battery and chip components.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aim is simple, according to the leak. Hyundai wants to accelerate the transition to EVs, and that means devoting much more of its energy to the newer technology.

The change in priorities would make sense, at least.

There wouldn&#39;t be much point to designing new engines that would only have a brief time on the market, and the company is likely to significantly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html">expand its EV lineup</a> long before any government cutoffs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-gas-engine-development-shutdown-174556919.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">792e5fee-61ef-4c29-b8fd-26bff0c54839</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 17:45:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640710217</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T16:50:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa84ca0-67f4-11ec-9b52-733673c795eb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa84ca0-67f4-11ec-9b52-733673c795eb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's latest C-Lab projects include a smart guitar with LED guides]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it does every year <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-to-showcase-innovative-startup-projects-from-c-lab-inside-and-c-lab-outside-at-ces-2022">around this time</a>, Samsung has unveiled its C-Lab incubator projects for CES 2022, with the aim to gauge customer response and further advance the most promising ideas. The star of the show this year is ZamStar, a guitar and app combo designed to make collaboration and learning easier. Other notable projects include an AI solution to help kids develop good smartphone habits and a nursery mobile that can allow for early detection of infant strabismus (eye crossing).&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/zamstar">ZamStar</a> consists of an app and a custom guitar called ZamString. The idea is that you can play a part on the guitar, add effects and then sync it up with other musicians around the world. It&#39;s clearly a riff on the COVID-19 TikTok trend of musical collaborations (remember all those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/style/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman.html">sea shanties</a> early this year), with the idea of making it easy to sync up your music. Meanwhile, the ZamString guitar has a fretboard that lights via input from a song, making it easy to figure out where to put your fingers. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKctumpc__U">not a new concept</a>, but perhaps the first to marry both the learning and collaboration aspects.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/piloto">Piloto</a>, meanwhile, is what Samsung calls an &quot;AI solution that helps children develop proper smartphone usage habits.&quot; The aim is to teach kids &quot;self-regulation skills&quot; on smart devices to help them make good choices. Finally, <a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/innovision">Innovision</a> is &quot;a daily life eye-care system with a nursery mobile to catch suspicious symptoms of the strabismus and monitor visual ability development status for babies.&quot; That seems like a smart idea, since babies gaze natural towards mobiles.</p><p>Along with its inside incubators, Samsung&#39;s C-Lab Outside is backing nine startups, including an AI-based biometric recognition solution for pets called Petnow.

The Xiaomi 12 has a 4,500mAh battery, while the 12 Pro has what the company claims is the first single-cell 120W, 4,600mAh battery. Xiaomi says it offers an increased capacity of 400mAh over dual-cell batteries without having to increase the size.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base model&#39;s camera array includes Sony&#39;s 50MP IMX766 as the main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 5MP telemacro sensor.

But while the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro updates represent the most obvious case of Apple owning up to (and rectifying) past mistakes, the company has actually been on this course for the last few years. And at the end of 2021, Apple has just about finished replacing some of its most problematic designs.</p><p>Reviews of the new MacBook Pro are almost universally positive (aside from the high price points), but it’s still worth recapping just what a big change these laptops represent from their predecessors. Both of the new sizes are thicker and noticeably heavier than the models they replace; for a company that showed an almost fanatical obsession with thin-and-light design over the last decade, it’s a major about-face. But the older, 4-pound, 15-inch MacBook Pro often had trouble staying cool under heavy processor loads, a problem that couldn’t be solved without increasing the laptop’s size and weight. It’s as if Apple remembered it already has the MacBook Air, and that the people buying a Pro are willing to lug around a bit of extra weight for a more capable machine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1d7615a0-6270-11ec-b77f-f895064ad3a2" alt="Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)" data-uuid="47584385-b794-3296-b18c-d233a119c785"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar / Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple arguably started moving in this direction with a mid-cycle refresh a few years ago. In 2019, the company started banishing the unreliable and uncomfortable butterfly keyboard for a significantly improved scissor-switch model. That revised keyboard arrived <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">on the first 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>. Along with the new keyboard, that laptop was a third of a pound heavier, and larger in every dimension than its predecessor.</p><p>That was the first indication that Apple was willing to fix some of the ill-fated decisions it made with the MacBook Pro lineup, which brings us to this fall’s refresh. Users still had a laundry list of things they wanted changing, and Apple largely delivered. The new models brought back the SD card slot and HDMI port that the company removed in 2016. The MagSafe charging port, one of Apple’s smartest innovations, also made a comeback. Finally, Apple replaced the Touch Bar with a standard row of function keys.</p><p>Of course, Apple only deserves so much credit for fixing self-inflicted wounds. But it feels like the company has a much clearer vision of what the people shelling out (at least) $2,000 for a MacBook Pro actually want. And beyond simply fixing earlier mistakes, the Apple-built M1 Pro and M1 Max processors offer massive performance gains and better battery life. Add in an outstanding new display and excellent keyboard and MacBook Pro buyers have a lot to look forward to. The fact that these computers are thicker and heavier than the ones they replace will barely be a consideration for most, especially since bigger laptops have space for things like extra ports, larger batteries and better cooling systems.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/939b8ea0-626f-11ec-bdfa-783052dcc8b0" alt="iPhone 13 Pro lineup" data-uuid="9fdac93c-4135-3c79-bf02-a41c5086f6fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>While the MacBook Pro is the obvious example of Apple giving the people what they want this year, it’s not the only one. Take the iPhone 13 launch. The company once again released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">two standard models</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">two “Pro” models</a>, just as it did in 2020. In most ways, these phones were iterative updates over the 12 series — but all four phones have significantly better battery life than their predecessors. Improving longevity is an obvious way to make customers happy, but it’s still good news that Apple quickly identified the weak spot with the iPhone 12 lineup and fixed it. Perhaps not coincidentally, all iPhone 13 models are also all a little heavier than last year’s. (They&#39;re also imperceptibly thicker, at .30 inches vs. .29 for the iPhone 12.)</p><p>Again, though, there’s some recent precedence for Apple putting battery life over a thin-at-all-costs design. 2018’s iPhone XR was a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-iphone-xr-phil-schiller-interview.html">cheaper and slightly less elegant</a> version of the flagship iPhone XS — but its larger screen and thicker body left room for a battery that smoked the “superior” XS. So, in 2019, Apple made the iPhone 11 Pro bigger than the XS it replaced, but it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-pro-max-review.html">vastly improved battery life</a>. It was particularly surprising to see Apple make a bigger iPhone after chasing thinness at all costs for so long, but it was definitely welcome. The company finally seems to realize that an impossibly thin device that constantly needs to be charged doesn’t make for a good user experience.</p><p>Another good example is Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">significant change of heart</a> around product repairs. Specifically, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">announced plans</a> to sell repair parts and instructions to customers who want to fix their iPhones themselves, a victory for anyone who felt they should be able to pop open their iPhone and put in a new battery or fix a broken display. While right-to-repair groups said there&#39;s still more Apple can do in this area, they nonetheless hailed it as a major step forward from the completely closed nature of its products, the vast majority of which haven&#39;t been user-serviceable before. Apple is starting with the iPhone, but said it will roll out some self-repair tools and parts for M1-based Macs in 2022, as well. The threat of government regulation may have played a big role in this new initiative, but the end result is still good for consumers.</p><p>Apple is even having a little more fun with its products than it has in a while. Take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the M1-powered iMac</a>, for example. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-no-ports-why-191552791.html">wish that it had more ports</a> and, considering the price, it should have more RAM and storage — but the wide variety of colors Apple chose is just great. I’m dying for these colorways to come to a redesigned MacBook Air (fingers crossed for the spring). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-171521559.html">three new hues</a> in the HomePod mini lineup are another good example of Apple realizing that hardware you place in your home doesn’t just have to be gray or silver.</p><p>While the new MacBook Pro is a huge step forward for those who want serious power on the go, Apple still hasn’t given professionals the full desktop-class computers they need. Because Apple is in the middle of its transition to Apple Silicon, the larger iMac and Mac Pro machines are hard to recommend right now. Hopefully, Apple will bring the power of the M1 Pro and M1 Max to a larger iMac and a new Mac Pro tower in 2022. If they can wrap up this last bit of the transition next year, Mac buyers will be covered at all points of the company’s product lineup. It’s been way too long since we could say that.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-year-in-review-143043756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">202877ea-5041-4073-b81f-d9602b09a500</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 14:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640259485</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:38:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best accessories for your new Xbox Series X or S]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you bought an Xbox Series X or S a year ago, your selection of accessories mostly came down to aging gear designed for last-gen systems.

The <em>League of Legends</em> publisher was only going to pay $10 million per the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-riot-games-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement.html">preliminary settlement</a> in 2019, but the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing went to court to block the agreement. $10 million was much too small, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">agency argued</a>, and the women suing the company could be entitled to as much as $400 million.</p><p>The lawsuit was originally filed by Melanie McCracken and Jess Negrón after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"><em>Kotaku report</em></a> exposed the developers&#39; &quot;men-first&quot; and &quot;bro&quot; company culture. In the report, <em>Kotaku</em> detailed employees&#39; experiences within the company, such as instances of &quot;genital grabbing&quot; and senior leaders passing around lists of employees they would sleep with. One former employee who left the company due to sexism said working for Riot was like &quot;working at a giant fraternity.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the terms of the settlement, $80 million will go towards members of the class-action lawsuit, while $20 million will go towards the plaintiffs&#39; legal fees. All employees and contractors in California who identify as women and who worked at Riot between November 2014 until present day qualify for a payout. Those who&#39;ve been with the company longer will get a bigger cut than newer workers. And there are quite a lot of newer ones — while only around 1,000 workers were qualified for a payout in 2019, there are now around 2,300 eligible personnel. In a statement, the developer told <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Three years ago, Riot was at the heart of what became a reckoning in our industry. We had to face the fact that despite our best intentions, we hadn’t always lived up to our values. As a company we stood at a crossroads; we could deny the shortcomings of our culture, or we could apologize, correct course, and build a better Riot. We chose the latter... While we&#39;e proud of how far we’ve come since 2018, we must also take responsibility for the past. We hope that this settlement properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to paying $100 million, Riot Games is also required to get a third-party expert to conduct &quot;sex/gender equity analysis of total compensation, assignment and promotion outcomes for California employees.&quot; Riot must also allow pay transparency and will have to be monitored by a third party, who&#39;ll keep an eye on things like HR complaints and pay equity, for three years. The monitor will be able to recommend changes to the company that Riot can implement.&nbsp;</p><p>Genie Harrison, the women&#39;s rights attorney who represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a great day for the women of Riot Games – and for women at all video game and tech companies – who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination. We appreciate Riot’s introspection and work since 2018 toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, its willingness to take responsibility for its past, and its commitment to fairness and equality in the future. Along with the DFEH and DLSE, the brave women of Riot who carried the torch of justice have achieved a precedent-setting result that stands as a beacon for other women and as a warning that employers had better pay and treat women fairly, or else be held accountable.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-settles-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-100049078.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">07da685d-47bb-44b2-8348-eb293c01ae84</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 10:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640683318</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T09:22:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dania Maxwell via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 06: Workers at Riot Games listen to a speaker during a staged walk out at Riot Games to protest the company's move to force arbitration on sexual harassment lawsuits on May 6, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.

After staying relatively quiet over the past two years, it’s now <a href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1932/vuzix-announces-agreement-with-verizon-to-deliver-augmented">partnering with Verizon</a>. The two didn’t share many details about their collaboration. What they did say is that they plan to find ways to commercialize AR technology for use in sports and gaming scenarios, especially those involving the need for training. The partnership will combine Vuzix’s new Shield smart glasses and the capabilities of Verizon’s 5G network.</p><p>It’s hard to say if we’ll see anything impactful come out of this agreement, but it’s not a surprise to see Verizon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html"><ins>become more involved in AR technology</ins></a>. Augmented, virtual and mixed reality wearables have been consistently positioned as one of the primary beneficiaries of the speed and latency enhancements promised by 5G networks. Likewise, the focus on gaming and sports isn’t surprising either. Some of the earliest locations where Verizon had 5G service was in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-verizon-5g-13-nfl-stadiums.html"><ins>NFL stadiums</ins></a>. They’re one of few places where the carrier’s mmWave deployments shine since there’s enough density there to justify building out all the small cells required to blanket even a small area with ultrafast 5G coverage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-vuzix-ar-partnership-211550397.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b508c22-7e94-4b8f-90ba-cdbc99728cdf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 21:15:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640638019</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T20:47:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3358e3a0-6754-11ec-9bb6-b18b6f273daf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3358e3a0-6754-11ec-9bb6-b18b6f273daf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vuzix / Verizon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vuzix Shield]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vuzix Shield]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grell Audio's TWS/1 earbuds sound as good as you want them to]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new entrant to the true wireless headphone space you say? Sure, that might be a fairly common occurrence these days, but this one – <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grell-audio-tws-1-earbuds-annoucement-040050084.html">Grell Audio</a> – comes with some pretty strong heritage. Its founder, Axel Grell, is well known in the headphone industry for his extensive work at Sennheiser on some of the company’s most prestigious products. The <a href="https://grellaudio.com/en/product/1/in-ear-headphones-tws-1-space-grey">TWS/1</a> is his first solo product under the Grell brand. Accordingly, we’re interested to see what the $200 wireless buds can do.</p><p>The TWS/1 has a modern look. The mostly circular design is only interrupted by a small, AirPod-like protuberance on each bud. Originally the plan was to have the outer casing entirely metal but physics and radio waves meant that some concessions (plastic parts) were needed. Overall, they maintain a premium feel that stands above that often found at this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html">price</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-tws-zne01-anc-fwd02-sport-140056623.html">point</a>. They visually remind me slightly of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Jabra Elite 75t</a>, but a little lower profile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of fit, that slightly more streamlined design means you don’t feel like something is balancing in your ear which can sometimes happen with more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html">rotund models</a>. As per usual they come with a charging case that promises four full charges of the TWS/1. The buds themselves offer around 6 hours per charge which holds true in my experience with ANC activated. Curiously, the buds are placed in the case with the right one to the left and vice versa. I’m not sure why this would be, but it does take some remembering (you’ll soon be reminded as the buds don’t fit the other way around).</p><p>In a world of me-too products, it’s hard to stand out. The easiest differentiator is price, then sound quality and or additional/premium features. It seems Grell Audio has tried to tackle all three of these, and with general success, I would say.</p><p>The price point puts the TWS/1 in an unusual category. Many premium brands are landing in the $250+ zone while more affordable options, like Google’s second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-2020-160030712.html">Pixel Buds</a> or the aforementioned Jabra’s live in the $150 area. Budget options, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">south of $100</a>, are also increasingly more common. This, then, pitches the TWS/1 at the overlap between high-mid and low-premium. I would wager this is entirely intentional as feature set and build quality skew higher end, but the barebones packaging and more accessible price indicate a more mainstream audience.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0f6c36c0-671f-11ec-bef1-df948f128588" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="bceea645-9345-3ff0-b8db-128f315bfb8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for sound quality, this is where things are a little more clear. In my testing, I was generally pleased with the default sound. It was perhaps a little on the thinner side for my personal preference with a slight weight on the lower end for a typically commercial sound. But Grell has partnered with SoundID – a third-party app that tunes select brands of headphones to your personal preference/hearing.</p><p>We’ve seen things like this before, most notably with Nura which takes this to a whole new level. SoundID is a little more understated in its approach. It still uses some form of hearing test, but rather than asking if you can hear certain tones, it simply plays you some music and asks “which do you prefer, A or B.” Once I completed this short test, the difference was night and day. With my own personal profile activated (it uploads to the headphones so it applies no matter what you are listening on), my usual mix of mid ‘10s indie and rave nonsense came alive.</p><p>I have a slight preference for dynamic range and beefier low and mid-high frequencies. At least, I presume I do because that was the biggest change in sound after completing the test and I instantly found them much more enjoyable. In the SoundID app, you can toggle between the default sound and your own profile and it really does make a huge difference. You don’t <em>need</em> the app to get good sound, but I’m going to guess that you’ll be happier with what it gives you.</p><p>Coincidentally, SoundID is also where you’ll get software updates for the TWS/1. I had one during my testing and it improved a few things including the slightly unresponsive touch controls. They’re still not reading my taps 1:1 but its about on par with most other touch-control buds I have used. Before the update, it was much more frustrating (or, maybe I just learned the technique?).</p><p>Those controls aren’t user-configurable, so you’re stuck with what Grell gives you. But, fortunately, that’s pretty much everything you’d want and without too many complicated tap or gesture combinations. Swiping forward or back on the left ear skips tracks, up or down on the right for volume, and so on. It was the single taps that I was having issues with which control play/pause on the right and transparency mode on the left – both of which are more annoying if not activated immediately.</p><p>This brings us on to smart(er) features. As mentioned, the TWS/1 has Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode – both of which are becoming increasingly standard. But there’s also a Noise Annoyance Reduction (NAR) mode. Grell explained to me during their initial announcement briefing that ANC is great for lower-frequency sustained noises, but doesn’t work as well for higher-frequency annoyances (think, crying baby on a plane). NAR is Grell’s own attempt at offering some reduction of these types of sound.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2e4d2ea0-671f-11ec-9fbf-1df5e18a8ea7" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="fb8ed1cd-6db0-3bef-903c-1f617f23d474"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In practice, I found it hard to pinpoint the difference that NAR makes. With ANC, it’s easy to hear the low rumble of the road outside my apartment decrease in volume. It’s maybe not the most powerful ANC I have heard but it does the job. With NAR, whatever the ear equivalent of squinting is, proved to be a little more indeterminate. It does seem to slightly improve the listening experience in combination with ANC, but it’s also hard to tell how much of that was me willing it to do so. It’s an interesting concept though and one that I hope Grell can continue to improve over time.</p><p>Other small perks include a “mono” mode (listening with just one bud). This isn’t as common as it should be in my opinion and it adds more flexibility for those that want to maintain some spatial awareness without having to wear both buds. It’s also, obviously, how some people prefer to handle their calls, too (reliving the Bluetooth headset days).</p><p>Another small added bonus is wireless charging “compatibility.” It’s not something I was able to test, but the more things that support it the better? Or, at the very least, it’s a nice perk for those already invested in the wireless charging world.</p><p>All in, Grell has given price, features and sound quality enough consideration that the result is a promising first product from an emerging brand. The price point, in particular, strikes a good balance between signaling premium ambitions without putting it too far out of reach for mainstream casuals. I’d love to see some further advances on the NAR technology and the controls could still be more responsive, but if you’re looking for a fresh set of true wireless headphones that are customizable to your taste, these are a great place to start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/grell-audio-tws-1-earbuds-review-200056428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">632d7a0f-a5bc-47db-939f-09aeff37a650</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640634616</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T19:52:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best apps to download on your new smartphone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You just got your hands on a new phone. Naturally, your first inclination is to head to the App Store or the Google Play Store to download your favorite apps to your shiny new device. While the Engadget team tries to keep our phones relatively unencumbered, there are some apps we can&#39;t live without because they make our work and daily lives easier. Below you&#39;ll find a dozen of the best we think you should try.</p><h2>1Password</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/5e5eebb0-706c-11eb-b7ce-c09d93af4b80" alt="1Password for iOS" data-uuid="93d86017-9bd9-3f97-8663-cd290712c1c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>If you only take one piece of advice away from this article, it&#39;s that you should download a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html">password manager</a>. It doesn&#39;t have to be the one we recommend here. However, we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> for a handful of reasons. Not only will it let you generate strong passwords for all your online accounts, but it also has built-in support for two-factor authentication. That means you don&#39;t need to download a separate app like Authy to make your logins as secure as possible. If you have access to a Fastmail account, you can also use 1Password to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fastmail-1password-masked-email-110028257.html">generate random emails</a> for your logins, giving you another way to protect your privacy. It&#39;s also just a well-designed app that&#39;s a pleasure to use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>FireFox</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/70bf40d0-5e8b-11ec-b7f2-8f47f6b4d1e4" alt="Firefox" data-uuid="5c2b1559-f61c-387b-8fbc-b52f042c3201"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Firefox</div></figure><p>If it&#39;s been a few years since you last used Firefox, now is a great time to revisit it. Partway through last year, Mozilla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-for-android-update-080007893.html">overhauled the Android version</a> of its browser to bring over many of its best desktop features to mobile. That release saw Mozilla add more robust support for third-party add-ons. It also brought over its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature, which stops trackers from misusing your browsing data. Separately, with Apple allowing you to change your default browser since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-ios-14-130014162.html">release of iOS 14</a>, there&#39;s never been a better time for iPhone users to liberate themselves from Safari.</p><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8" alt="Headspace" data-uuid="b34162df-637f-305c-81d9-be2428168b1f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>I subscribed to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace" href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace</a> at the start of the pandemic. Since then, it&#39;s become one of the few apps I use every day. Yes, Headspace is a meditation and mindfulness app, but it&#39;s also so much more than that. You&#39;ll find it also has a mix of music designed to help you focus and workouts for unwinding at the end of a long day. Across the board, everything it offers is excellent, and you&#39;ll find yourself turning to it for more than just peace of mind.</p><h2>Hopper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf24f1d0-5e8a-11ec-bff3-a8bc5d7992ed" alt="Hopper app" data-uuid="18136120-77c6-3e17-bf7e-9f554a857897"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hopper</div></figure><p>If you plan to fly somewhere soon, install <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hopper" href="https://fave.co/31AdPP0">Hopper</a> on your phone. While it has grown over the years to include a variety of features, at its core, Hopper is one of the best ways to save money on plane tickets. Once you tell the app where and when you want to fly, it’ll tell you whether you should book your flight now or wait. In the latter case, it’ll notify you when it estimates you&#39;ll get the best deal. The beauty of Hopper is it will save you from constantly checking websites like Google Flights and Kayak.</p><h2>Libby</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c0443760-abf7-11eb-97bf-2c309f64c2f9" alt="Libby" data-uuid="d5e967d3-cd20-3160-b2da-4863a49a638d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Libby</div></figure><p>If you want to do more reading in 2022, forget about buying books through Amazon and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">download Libby</a> instead. If you&#39;re not familiar with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:app" href="https://fave.co/334ap89">app</a>, it allows you to borrow ebooks, digital magazines and graphic novels from your local library. All you need is a library card, which most systems across the US offer for free. Sometimes you have to wait to borrow the books you want to read most, but you&#39;ll find Libby will dramatically expand your reading list.</p><h2>Open Table</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/37db4870-5f46-11ec-b3f3-645f7ec545ea" alt="Open Table" data-uuid="f2a5d13e-97cc-3130-8c3a-92ec7b2487c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Open Table</div></figure><p>With restaurants reopening in cities throughout the US and the rest of the world, there&#39;s a good chance you plan to eat out sometime soon — and so does nearly everyone else. That means you&#39;ll likely need a reservation to dine at some of the most popular spots in your city. In North America, the closest you&#39;ll find to a single platform that nearly every restaurant uses is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Open Table" href="https://fave.co/3GfMIrK">Open Table</a>. For that reason alone, it&#39;s a must-download if you eat out a lot. It&#39;s also a handy tool for discovering new spots to visit since you can filter by cuisine and area.</p><h2>Transit</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cb70ae20-5e8a-11ec-9e7f-3374adcb4d05" alt="Transit app" data-uuid="e98950af-ce91-3899-922e-72fe03bd932f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Transit</div></figure><p>There&#39;s nothing worse than waiting for a bus on a cold winter’s day or watching three go by one after another. Avoid both situations with one of the best public transit planning apps on Android and iOS. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Transit" href="https://fave.co/3rUsNuH">Transit</a> excels where other apps in the category fail thanks to its clean, easy-to-use interface that highlights all the options near you. It also has one of the better algorithms for predicting departure times, so you&#39;ll know exactly when you need to run out of your house or apartment to catch the next bus, train or streetcar.</p><h2>Paprika</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7d220790-5e8b-11ec-9beb-3edf6f0f6641" alt="Paprika recipe app" data-uuid="fb9ca1ad-bb3b-3406-8b46-f525434aa278"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Paprika</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Paprika" href="https://fave.co/3Gk4j1A">Paprika</a> is the best $5 you can spend to make feeding yourself even easier. At its core, it allows you to download recipes from your favorite websites and make them accessible on all your devices. You can also use it to scale the size of the meal you&#39;re about to cook and convert between metric and imperial measurements. Add to that a meal planner, shopping lists and a tool for tracking the ingredients in your pantry, and you have an indispensable app for home cooks.</p><h2>Pocket Casts</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d991c6b0-5e8a-11ec-b69f-401c90e23326" alt="Pocket Casts app" data-uuid="d95444c2-35ed-393c-a323-38452f607168"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket Casts</div></figure><p>With podcasts becoming ever more popular with each passing year, there&#39;s a good chance you already have a handful of favorite shows you listen to every week. As much as Spotify would like to convince you it has the best podcast app, that distinction goes to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket Casts" href="https://fave.co/3lDMbrK">Pocket Casts</a>. We like it because it offers a consistently great experience across every system it supports. And if you use a mix of platforms from Apple, Google and Microsoft, you don&#39;t have to worry about syncing, either. It’s also nice to use software that doesn’t feel caught between two worlds in the way that Spotify does. Pocket Casts isn’t trying to be anything more than an app for listening to podcasts. That’s not something you can say of Spotify, and it’s often a source of frustration for those who turn to it for music.</p><h2>Pocket</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e72ebb20-5e8a-11ec-bbbd-79f45195740b" alt="Pocket app" data-uuid="6d6e1281-8451-31ed-9b77-8e3da3515923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket</div></figure><p>Another way to read more in 2022 is to download <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket" href="https://fave.co/3pv4alp">Pocket</a>. It&#39;s among the most popular read-it-later apps out there, allowing you to save articles you find online. Much like Pocket Casts, what makes this app compelling is that it offers a consistently excellent device-agnostic experience, making it a great option for those who haven&#39;t gone all-in on one ecosystem. Whether you use Chrome, Safari or Edge, you can install a browser extension to save articles you stumble upon. You can then read them later without distractions on your phone or tablet. Just don&#39;t forget to make a dent in your Pocket reading list occasionally.</p><h2>Telegram / Signal</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8c925c70-5e8b-11ec-bd73-3cebb4a8cffb" alt="Telegram app" data-uuid="cc4e6000-c3ef-39d7-b65e-0333105a8e20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Telegram</div></figure><p>We understand, asking your friends and family to install another messaging app on their phone can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task, but the effort has also never been more worth it. In <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Telegram" href="https://fave.co/3Ew10nt">Telegram</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Signal" href="https://fave.co/3rJxOWD">Signal</a>, you&#39;ll find two of the most secure chat apps on the market. We especially like Telegram here at Engadget because of how complete it feels from a feature standpoint. For example, it includes an edit feature that comes in handy when you make a typo, and a Secret Chat tool for when you want messages to disappear. If you do make the switch to Telegram or Signal, you&#39;ll also free yourself of the Meta ecosystem. That might not seem like much, but when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-outage-explainer-193155776.html">went down earlier this year</a>, it left many people without a way to communicate with their friends and loved ones.</p><h2>Tunnelbear</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/fbcd8330-c5df-11ea-9f7b-2d20663edfe1" alt="Tunnelbear for Android" data-uuid="ab882100-ea83-4399-b432-8032f85e94e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tunnelbear</div></figure><p>After a Password manager, one of the best tools you can use to safeguard your online privacy is a VPN. Again, there are many options out there, but we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:TunnelBear" href="https://fave.co/3FTjEHk">TunnelBear</a> for its simplicity and whimsical ursine theme. A VPN isn&#39;t as essential as a password manager, but you&#39;ll want to get one if you frequently find yourself traveling or using the public WiFi at places like cafes and libraries. Using a VPN in those contexts will ensure your connection is protected with encryption so that any information you send over remains safe and private.</p><h2>Snapseed</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/465381b0-5f46-11ec-b3ff-47f3a4374f8c" alt="Snapseed" data-uuid="5426a1fc-104d-37c1-9e2a-3044105fb545"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snapseed</div></figure><p>Most recent phones come with great cameras. Still, even with the latest iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, almost every photo can benefit from an edit before you share it.

It&#39;s an old favorite that offers a comprehensive suite of editing options but never gets bogged down in too many sliders and dials. Best of all, it makes it easy to save edits to your camera roll and upload them to apps like Instagram.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-apps-to-download-on-your-new-smartphone-ios-android-180049321.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e99bfad-2528-4914-92ca-34ae96e3f702</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639763702</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T17:55:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elisaveta Ivanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s ‘New World’ is among the year’s biggest money makers on Steam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has once again given some insight into the highest-earning games of the year on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam/">Steam</a>.

While device bans require more effort to circumvent, particularly on mobile, it&#39;s not impossible.

racing game fan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not much of a car guy, but I do enjoy a good drive on an open road and have at least a passing appreciation for a fine automobile. Of course, my beyond-humble Toyota Prius only offers so much in the way of driving thrills. A realistic racing game always sounded like a great way to scratch that driving itch, but they’re almost always just too involved and difficult for me.</p><p>But my colleague Jess Conditt described the Forza Horizon series as “the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles” in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html">her glowing preview of the game</a>. I was sold, and so far <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has entirely lived up to the hype and praise it has received.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A big part of the reason why is that it’s the most approachable driving game I’ve ever tried. Take the ingenious “rewind button.” At first, I would push the accelerator to the floor and rarely let up, which made actually taking a turn without wiping out damn near impossible. But the rewind button let me try these difficult turns again without completely blowing the race I’m in or having to start the entire thing over again. I think that it helped me get better at the game significantly faster than I would have if I had to re-do a course every time I blew a turn. Without it, I’m pretty sure I would have given up on <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> pretty quickly.</p><div id="0cfc6c1c2b044436822a7e2dafb6befb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>What I wanted out of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> was the ability to drive vintage and modern cars I’d never get a chance to own around a beautifully-rendered Mexican countryside, and the auto car-tuning feature was another thing that made this dream easy to achieve. For people who really want to dive into it, the game’s cars are extremely customizable — but I couldn’t be bothered to figure out exactly what anti-roll bars, tires, suspension systems and so on I needed to buy so my 2003 Volkswagen GTI R32 would keep up with the competition. (Note to Jess: GTI. Every. Time.)</p><p>Fortunately, there’s an auto-upgrade feature that can level up your car to the top of various tiers (C isn’t as great as A, which isn’t as great as S1, for example). Of course, you’ll need to pay for the parts, but it’s worth the cost to max out your vehicles of choice without spending all day figuring out exactly what parts to buy.</p><section data-eng-breakout="74cfc697af8f44648b03d669f13bc777" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bfbd20-6727-11ec-bdb9-363ef8275d64" alt="Forza Horizon 5"></section><p>In the frankly shocking amount of time I’ve poured into <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> already, I’ve been delighted to find a game with the perfect blend of serious driving challenge and realism coupled with tools and design that make it extremely appealing to someone like me, who doesn’t have the time or desire to endlessly tweak their car for every race. It’s a lot more realistic than most arcade-style racers, but it’s definitely not so unforgiving as to be inaccessible to people who aren’t racing nerds.</p><p>Whether you’re a novice like me or someone more experienced with racing games, you’ll find a ton to keep you busy. Ultimately, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> isn’t wildly different from open-world adventure games — there’s a “story” you can follow and unlock different chapters as you go, and there’s also a huge variety of different challenges spread all over the map. I gravitated towards road racing events, but there’s a huge variety of different courses. Others might prefer going off-road, trying drag racing or competing in events to rack up trick points.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7c73730-6727-11ec-affe-aef384e1a4ff" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="cbc95916-9508-3b3e-8d26-749b53d18879"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games/Microsoft</div></figure><p>Regardless of how you like to play, it’s also a beautiful game; I was stunned by the variety of scenery across this little corner of Mexico I got to explore. Coupling that with events taking place at all different types of day and in different weather conditions and there’s always something new to see. I’ve only played it on the Xbox Series S on a 1080p TV — I’m hoping I can give it a go on a Series X or well-tuned gaming PC soon and see just how good it can look with the right hardware. But even on my more modest setup, I’m enjoying this game in a way I never expected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-gaming-irl-racing-154527277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2194bbf-2c5b-45e1-a59f-7a6cdd3c344d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:45:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640618802</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T04:30:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Playground Games/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best accessories for your new Nintendo Switch OLED edition]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/3oyDiBw">Switch OLED</a> is out, and it’s a real beaut. It has a larger 7-inch screen, longer battery life and a few other welcome design improvements to its handheld gaming mode. I was impressed when I reviewed it back in October, and it’s been flying off store shelves since its release. It’s so hard to get one right now, in fact, that you may have to go to eBay to snag one before the holidays. But if you do have one — congrats! Now you probably want to make the most of your new system, and there are a few accessories that will go a long way toward making the Switch OLED a truly stellar console.</p><h2>SanDisk microSD card</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/feb6f7e0-584e-11ec-afdf-4512fd2e4daf" alt="SanDisk Nintendo Switch microSD card" data-uuid="25bafb89-6544-3e30-a6af-c36b302bdc51"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SanDisk</div></figure><p>With only 64GB of on-board storage, you’re going to want to get a microSD for your Switch OLED to store downloaded games, save files and screenshots. And with the redesigned slot it’s easier than ever to put it in or take it out of the system, too. You can use pretty much any microSD card with your Nintendo Switch, but the Nintendo-branded ones from SanDisk are solid, and you can get a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB model" href="https://amzn.to/31oG4QC">256GB model</a> at a pretty affordable rate right now.

But you’re still dealing with the same old Joy-Cons, which might be a bit too small for players with larger hands. In that case you’ll want to upgrade to a more pro-level gamepad. And yes, there is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo&#x002019;s Pro Controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Nintendo’s Pro Controller</a>, which is still the best choice for your Switch overall if you can get one, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:8Bitdo&#x002019;s Pro 2" href="https://amzn.to/3oesvfN">8Bitdo’s Pro 2</a> is also great, not to mention incredibly flexible; you can use it with your Android device, as well as a PC or Mac desktop.

In that case I recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:8Bitdo Lite" href="https://amzn.to/3d9OXAq">8Bitdo Lite</a>, which offers up two d-pads and an extra set of directional buttons, perfect for 2D gaming.

It looks a lot like the official Switch Pro controller thanks to its grips, shoulder buttons and matte black coloring, but it’s two-thirds the size and includes a set of back buttons you can program to suit your needs.
