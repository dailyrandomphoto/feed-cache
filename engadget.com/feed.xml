The studio is working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tencent/">Tencent</a> on a free-to-play co-op shooter codenamed <em>Vanguard </em>(no relation to the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call%20of%20duty%20vanguard/"><em>Call of Duty game</em></a>).</p><p>The player vs. environment (PVE) title will bring &quot;Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience,&quot; <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-signs-a-global-development-license-and-distribution-agreement-with-tencent-for-the-co-operative-multiplayer-game-codenamed-vanguard/">the developer said</a>. It&#39;s making the game for PC and consoles, but it&#39;ll probably be some time before Remedy offers a look at <em>Vanguard</em>, since it&#39;s still in the proof-of-concept stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Remedy will publish the game in most countries, though Tencent will localize and publish it in some Asian markets. The companies are co-financing <em>Vanguard</em>, which will be a live service game that&#39;s frequently updated. Remedy and Tencent will each pay their own publishing and operation costs, and they&#39;ll give each other a slice of revenue after they earn back what they shelled out on development.</p><p>In addition, Tencent will make and release a mobile version of <em>Vanguard, </em>which is Remedy’s original intellectual property. The Chinese conglomerate will cover the development and publishing costs, and it will share revenue with Remedy.</p><p>“<em>Vanguard</em> marks Remedy’s first entry into Games-as-a-Service business model, executed by our top tier team of free-to-play experts. We are building something new and exciting for co-operative multiplayer space, on top of Remedy’s strengths,&quot; Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said in a statement. &quot;<em>Vanguard</em> is a global opportunity, and Tencent can support Remedy internationally, and lead the operations in Asia and the mobile markets.&quot;</p><p>Remedy has several other games on its slate. Back in June, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-spin-off-multiplayer-co-op-remedy-505-191228046.html">announced</a> a co-op PVE game based on the terrific <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/control/"><em>Control</em></a><em>, </em>as well as what sounds like a bigger-budget sequel. Earlier this month, the studio confirmed it&#39;s making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-2-announced-2023-release-014338992.html"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a><em>, </em>a sequel to the 2010 cult classic that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-remaster-4k-ps5-trailer-071047656.html">Remedy re-released this year</a>. The developer is also working on the single-player component of first-person shooter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crossfirex-remedy-entertainment-172425868.html"><em>CrossfireX</em></a>.</p><p>As for Tencent, the long-term partnership builds on a lengthy string of gaming deals the company has made in 2021. It has <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1471883075210645507">bought</a> or taken a stake in more than 100 gaming-related businesses this year. Most recently, Tencent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-turtle-rock-studios-back-4-blood-173423356.html">acquired</a><em> Back 4 Blood</em> maker Turtle Rock Studios.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/remedy-co-op-multiplayer-game-tencent-vanguard-183034867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43592b09-0275-4bb0-b914-798fb7304536</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 18:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640713848</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T17:50:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/33da4330-6805-11ec-bff8-eaa80c22fc30" width="1280" height="672" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/33da4330-6805-11ec-bff8-eaa80c22fc30" width="1280" height="672" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment logo.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Remedy Entertainment logo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyundai reportedly stops developing new combustion engines]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hyundai only just released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-first-drive-180018819.html">first ground-up electric car</a>, but it&#39;s apparently ready to leave combustion engines behind. As <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/hyundai-shuts-down-engine-development-team-focus-electric-cars/">reports</a>, <em>Korea Economic Daily</em><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202112230013?lang=us">sources</a> claim Hyundai shut down its research center&#39;s engine design unit sometime this month. There will still be some workers left to refine existing engines, but the rest will move to EV-related work.</p><p>The company is understood to be converting buildings for EV development at the same time. The powertrain development center is becoming an electrification test facility, and the performance development center is now dedicated to electrified machines. There&#39;s also a new battery development center, while researchers are now sourcing raw battery and chip components.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aim is simple, according to the leak. Hyundai wants to accelerate the transition to EVs, and that means devoting much more of its energy to the newer technology. Electrification is &quot;inevitable,&quot; new research chief Park Chung-kook reportedly said in email, and the transition will help produce cars that &quot;dominate the future market.&quot;</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Hyundai for comment. The change in priorities would make sense, at least. Many countries and individual states intend to ban combustion car sales <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-law-ban-gas-powered-car-sales-2035-053554406.html">in the 2030s</a>. Hyundai&#39;s home of South Korea, for instance, has a climate plan that would ban combustion-only sales by 2030 and all combustion vehicle sales by 2035. Hyundai is already <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/hyundais-diesel-engines-are-dead">phasing out</a> diesels. There wouldn&#39;t be much point to designing new engines that would only have a brief time on the market, and the company is likely to significantly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html">expand its EV lineup</a> long before any government cutoffs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-gas-engine-development-shutdown-174556919.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">792e5fee-61ef-4c29-b8fd-26bff0c54839</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 17:45:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640710217</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T16:50:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa84ca0-67f4-11ec-9b52-733673c795eb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fa84ca0-67f4-11ec-9b52-733673c795eb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's latest C-Lab projects include a smart guitar with LED guides]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it does every year <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-to-showcase-innovative-startup-projects-from-c-lab-inside-and-c-lab-outside-at-ces-2022">around this time</a>, Samsung has unveiled its C-Lab incubator projects for CES 2022, with the aim to gauge customer response and further advance the most promising ideas. The star of the show this year is ZamStar, a guitar and app combo designed to make collaboration and learning easier. Other notable projects include an AI solution to help kids develop good smartphone habits and a nursery mobile that can allow for early detection of infant strabismus (eye crossing).&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/zamstar">ZamStar</a> consists of an app and a custom guitar called ZamString. The idea is that you can play a part on the guitar, add effects and then sync it up with other musicians around the world. It&#39;s clearly a riff on the COVID-19 TikTok trend of musical collaborations (remember all those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/style/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman.html">sea shanties</a> early this year), with the idea of making it easy to sync up your music. Meanwhile, the ZamString guitar has a fretboard that lights via input from a song, making it easy to figure out where to put your fingers. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKctumpc__U">not a new concept</a>, but perhaps the first to marry both the learning and collaboration aspects.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/piloto">Piloto</a>, meanwhile, is what Samsung calls an &quot;AI solution that helps children develop proper smartphone usage habits.&quot; The aim is to teach kids &quot;self-regulation skills&quot; on smart devices to help them make good choices. Finally, <a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/innovision">Innovision</a> is &quot;a daily life eye-care system with a nursery mobile to catch suspicious symptoms of the strabismus and monitor visual ability development status for babies.&quot; That seems like a smart idea, since babies gaze natural towards mobiles.</p><p>Along with its inside incubators, Samsung&#39;s C-Lab Outside is backing nine startups, including an AI-based biometric recognition solution for pets called Petnow. All of these projects will be on display with their own booths at CES 2022. So far, Samsung still appears to be planning to attend the event and has not followed the lead of other exhibitors (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-cancels-ces-2022-in-person-plans-221822468.html">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-wont-attend-ces-2022-172655236.html">Lenovo, Intel</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html">Amazon, Meta, T-Mobile</a>) by cancelling.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-c-lab-project-smart-guitar-led-guide-170029783.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10d3dd98-bcec-4fba-877a-4c5a11588802</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 17:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640692013</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T11:47:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/de857b60-67c9-11ec-9c56-0dd8f01ca78a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/de857b60-67c9-11ec-9c56-0dd8f01ca78a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung's latest C-Lab projects include a smart guitar with LED guides]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung's latest C-Lab projects include a smart guitar with LED guides ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xiaomi’s 12 Series phones are among the first with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Xiaomi/"><ins>Xiaomi</ins></a> has <a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/12/28/xiaomi-unveils-latest-flagships-in-mainland-china-xiaomi-12-series/">unveiled</a> its latest lineup of flagship smartphones and wearables.

The Xiaomi 12 has a 4,500mAh battery, while the 12 Pro has what the company claims is the first single-cell 120W, 4,600mAh battery. Xiaomi says it offers an increased capacity of 400mAh over dual-cell batteries without having to increase the size.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base model&#39;s camera array includes Sony&#39;s 50MP IMX766 as the main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 5MP telemacro sensor. The 12 Pro, meanwhile, has the new Sony IMX707 sensor, an ultra-wide camera with a 115-degree field of view and a 2x telephoto camera for portraits. All three sensors are 50MP, while the main camera improves light capture by up to 49 percent over the previous model, according to Xiaomi.&nbsp;</p><p>On the front, each device has a 32MP sensor.

The company says it&#39;s introducing a new imaging computing algorithm, which it claims improves capture speed and shutter lag.</p><p>The Xiaomi 12 has a 6.28-inch flexible OLED display with a 2,400 × 1,080 resolution, 1,100 nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 120Hz. The 12 Pro offers a 6.73-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 3,200 x 1,440 and 1,500 nits of brightness. Xiaomi says the display uses micro-lens tech, which it claims improves the &quot;viewing experience while increasing smart energy-saving capability.&quot; Both devices have HDR10+ and Dolby Vision support.</p><p>On the audio side, both handsets have symmetrical dual speakers and Dolby Atmos support. The 12 Pro features a customized mid-woofer and tweeter.</p><p>The devices will go on sale on December 31st, starting at RMB 3,699 (around $580) for the Xiaomi 12 and RMB 4,699 (approximately $738) for Xiaomi 12 Pro. The company also said it will release a lower-cost version of the Xiaomi 12 on the same day. The Xiaomi 12X has a Snapdragon 870 chipset and starts at RMB 3,199 ($500).</p><p>The phones will use MIUI 13, an OS based on Android 12 that&#39;s also coming to Mi 11 series handsets, Xiaomi 11T and other phones and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-pad-5-tablet-mi-smart-band-6-nfc-130034015.html"><ins>tablets</ins></a>.

The earbuds offer up to 40dB noise cancellation and three active noise cancellation modes. Xiaomi says owners will get up to seven hours of playback on a single charge and up to 32 hours of total use with the charging case. The Xiaomi Buds 3 will cost RMB 449 ($70).</p><p>While these devices are geared toward the Chinese market, they could make their way elsewhere at a later date.

But while the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro updates represent the most obvious case of Apple owning up to (and rectifying) past mistakes, the company has actually been on this course for the last few years. And at the end of 2021, Apple has just about finished replacing some of its most problematic designs.</p><p>Reviews of the new MacBook Pro are almost universally positive (aside from the high price points), but it’s still worth recapping just what a big change these laptops represent from their predecessors. Both of the new sizes are thicker and noticeably heavier than the models they replace; for a company that showed an almost fanatical obsession with thin-and-light design over the last decade, it’s a major about-face. But the older, 4-pound, 15-inch MacBook Pro often had trouble staying cool under heavy processor loads, a problem that couldn’t be solved without increasing the laptop’s size and weight. It’s as if Apple remembered it already has the MacBook Air, and that the people buying a Pro are willing to lug around a bit of extra weight for a more capable machine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1d7615a0-6270-11ec-b77f-f895064ad3a2" alt="Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)" data-uuid="47584385-b794-3296-b18c-d233a119c785"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar / Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple arguably started moving in this direction with a mid-cycle refresh a few years ago. In 2019, the company started banishing the unreliable and uncomfortable butterfly keyboard for a significantly improved scissor-switch model. That revised keyboard arrived <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">on the first 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>. Along with the new keyboard, that laptop was a third of a pound heavier, and larger in every dimension than its predecessor.</p><p>That was the first indication that Apple was willing to fix some of the ill-fated decisions it made with the MacBook Pro lineup, which brings us to this fall’s refresh. Users still had a laundry list of things they wanted changing, and Apple largely delivered. The new models brought back the SD card slot and HDMI port that the company removed in 2016. The MagSafe charging port, one of Apple’s smartest innovations, also made a comeback. Finally, Apple replaced the Touch Bar with a standard row of function keys.</p><p>Of course, Apple only deserves so much credit for fixing self-inflicted wounds. But it feels like the company has a much clearer vision of what the people shelling out (at least) $2,000 for a MacBook Pro actually want. And beyond simply fixing earlier mistakes, the Apple-built M1 Pro and M1 Max processors offer massive performance gains and better battery life. Add in an outstanding new display and excellent keyboard and MacBook Pro buyers have a lot to look forward to. The fact that these computers are thicker and heavier than the ones they replace will barely be a consideration for most, especially since bigger laptops have space for things like extra ports, larger batteries and better cooling systems.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/939b8ea0-626f-11ec-bdfa-783052dcc8b0" alt="iPhone 13 Pro lineup" data-uuid="9fdac93c-4135-3c79-bf02-a41c5086f6fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>While the MacBook Pro is the obvious example of Apple giving the people what they want this year, it’s not the only one. Take the iPhone 13 launch. The company once again released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">two standard models</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">two “Pro” models</a>, just as it did in 2020. In most ways, these phones were iterative updates over the 12 series — but all four phones have significantly better battery life than their predecessors. Improving longevity is an obvious way to make customers happy, but it’s still good news that Apple quickly identified the weak spot with the iPhone 12 lineup and fixed it. Perhaps not coincidentally, all iPhone 13 models are also all a little heavier than last year’s. (They&#39;re also imperceptibly thicker, at .30 inches vs. .29 for the iPhone 12.)</p><p>Again, though, there’s some recent precedence for Apple putting battery life over a thin-at-all-costs design. 2018’s iPhone XR was a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-iphone-xr-phil-schiller-interview.html">cheaper and slightly less elegant</a> version of the flagship iPhone XS — but its larger screen and thicker body left room for a battery that smoked the “superior” XS. So, in 2019, Apple made the iPhone 11 Pro bigger than the XS it replaced, but it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-pro-max-review.html">vastly improved battery life</a>. It was particularly surprising to see Apple make a bigger iPhone after chasing thinness at all costs for so long, but it was definitely welcome. The company finally seems to realize that an impossibly thin device that constantly needs to be charged doesn’t make for a good user experience.</p><p>Another good example is Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">significant change of heart</a> around product repairs. Specifically, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">announced plans</a> to sell repair parts and instructions to customers who want to fix their iPhones themselves, a victory for anyone who felt they should be able to pop open their iPhone and put in a new battery or fix a broken display. While right-to-repair groups said there&#39;s still more Apple can do in this area, they nonetheless hailed it as a major step forward from the completely closed nature of its products, the vast majority of which haven&#39;t been user-serviceable before. Apple is starting with the iPhone, but said it will roll out some self-repair tools and parts for M1-based Macs in 2022, as well. The threat of government regulation may have played a big role in this new initiative, but the end result is still good for consumers.</p><p>Apple is even having a little more fun with its products than it has in a while. Take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the M1-powered iMac</a>, for example. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-no-ports-why-191552791.html">wish that it had more ports</a> and, considering the price, it should have more RAM and storage — but the wide variety of colors Apple chose is just great. I’m dying for these colorways to come to a redesigned MacBook Air (fingers crossed for the spring). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-171521559.html">three new hues</a> in the HomePod mini lineup are another good example of Apple realizing that hardware you place in your home doesn’t just have to be gray or silver.</p><p>While the new MacBook Pro is a huge step forward for those who want serious power on the go, Apple still hasn’t given professionals the full desktop-class computers they need. Because Apple is in the middle of its transition to Apple Silicon, the larger iMac and Mac Pro machines are hard to recommend right now. Hopefully, Apple will bring the power of the M1 Pro and M1 Max to a larger iMac and a new Mac Pro tower in 2022. If they can wrap up this last bit of the transition next year, Mac buyers will be covered at all points of the company’s product lineup. It’s been way too long since we could say that.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-year-in-review-143043756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">202877ea-5041-4073-b81f-d9602b09a500</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 14:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640259485</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:38:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best accessories for your new Xbox Series X or S]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you bought an Xbox Series X or S a year ago, your selection of accessories mostly came down to aging gear designed for last-gen systems.

The <em>League of Legends</em> publisher was only going to pay $10 million per the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-riot-games-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement.html">preliminary settlement</a> in 2019, but the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing went to court to block the agreement. $10 million was much too small, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">agency argued</a>, and the women suing the company could be entitled to as much as $400 million.</p><p>The lawsuit was originally filed by Melanie McCracken and Jess Negrón after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"><em>Kotaku report</em></a> exposed the developers&#39; &quot;men-first&quot; and &quot;bro&quot; company culture. In the report, <em>Kotaku</em> detailed employees&#39; experiences within the company, such as instances of &quot;genital grabbing&quot; and senior leaders passing around lists of employees they would sleep with. One former employee who left the company due to sexism said working for Riot was like &quot;working at a giant fraternity.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the terms of the settlement, $80 million will go towards members of the class-action lawsuit, while $20 million will go towards the plaintiffs&#39; legal fees. All employees and contractors in California who identify as women and who worked at Riot between November 2014 until present day qualify for a payout. Those who&#39;ve been with the company longer will get a bigger cut than newer workers. And there are quite a lot of newer ones — while only around 1,000 workers were qualified for a payout in 2019, there are now around 2,300 eligible personnel. In a statement, the developer told <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Three years ago, Riot was at the heart of what became a reckoning in our industry. We had to face the fact that despite our best intentions, we hadn’t always lived up to our values. As a company we stood at a crossroads; we could deny the shortcomings of our culture, or we could apologize, correct course, and build a better Riot. We chose the latter... While we&#39;e proud of how far we’ve come since 2018, we must also take responsibility for the past. We hope that this settlement properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to paying $100 million, Riot Games is also required to get a third-party expert to conduct &quot;sex/gender equity analysis of total compensation, assignment and promotion outcomes for California employees.&quot; Riot must also allow pay transparency and will have to be monitored by a third party, who&#39;ll keep an eye on things like HR complaints and pay equity, for three years. The monitor will be able to recommend changes to the company that Riot can implement.&nbsp;</p><p>Genie Harrison, the women&#39;s rights attorney who represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a great day for the women of Riot Games – and for women at all video game and tech companies – who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination. We appreciate Riot’s introspection and work since 2018 toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, its willingness to take responsibility for its past, and its commitment to fairness and equality in the future. Along with the DFEH and DLSE, the brave women of Riot who carried the torch of justice have achieved a precedent-setting result that stands as a beacon for other women and as a warning that employers had better pay and treat women fairly, or else be held accountable.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-settles-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-100049078.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">07da685d-47bb-44b2-8348-eb293c01ae84</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 10:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640683318</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T09:22:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dania Maxwell via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 06: Workers at Riot Games listen to a speaker during a staged walk out at Riot Games to protest the company's move to force arbitration on sexual harassment lawsuits on May 6, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.

In early 2019, it came out with its first pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-14-vuzix-blade-smart-glasses.html"><ins>consumer-ready smart glasses</ins></a>. After staying relatively quiet over the past two years, it’s now <a href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1932/vuzix-announces-agreement-with-verizon-to-deliver-augmented">partnering with Verizon</a>. The two didn’t share many details about their collaboration. What they did say is that they plan to find ways to commercialize AR technology for use in sports and gaming scenarios, especially those involving the need for training. The partnership will combine Vuzix’s new Shield smart glasses and the capabilities of Verizon’s 5G network.</p><p>It’s hard to say if we’ll see anything impactful come out of this agreement, but it’s not a surprise to see Verizon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html"><ins>become more involved in AR technology</ins></a>. Augmented, virtual and mixed reality wearables have been consistently positioned as one of the primary beneficiaries of the speed and latency enhancements promised by 5G networks. Likewise, the focus on gaming and sports isn’t surprising either. Some of the earliest locations where Verizon had 5G service was in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-verizon-5g-13-nfl-stadiums.html"><ins>NFL stadiums</ins></a>. They’re one of few places where the carrier’s mmWave deployments shine since there’s enough density there to justify building out all the small cells required to blanket even a small area with ultrafast 5G coverage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-vuzix-ar-partnership-211550397.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b508c22-7e94-4b8f-90ba-cdbc99728cdf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 21:15:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640638019</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T20:47:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3358e3a0-6754-11ec-9bb6-b18b6f273daf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3358e3a0-6754-11ec-9bb6-b18b6f273daf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vuzix / Verizon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vuzix Shield]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vuzix Shield]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grell Audio's TWS/1 earbuds sound as good as you want them to]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A new entrant to the true wireless headphone space you say? Sure, that might be a fairly common occurrence these days, but this one – <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grell-audio-tws-1-earbuds-annoucement-040050084.html">Grell Audio</a> – comes with some pretty strong heritage. Its founder, Axel Grell, is well known in the headphone industry for his extensive work at Sennheiser on some of the company’s most prestigious products. The <a href="https://grellaudio.com/en/product/1/in-ear-headphones-tws-1-space-grey">TWS/1</a> is his first solo product under the Grell brand. Accordingly, we’re interested to see what the $200 wireless buds can do.</p><p>The TWS/1 has a modern look. The mostly circular design is only interrupted by a small, AirPod-like protuberance on each bud. Originally the plan was to have the outer casing entirely metal but physics and radio waves meant that some concessions (plastic parts) were needed. Overall, they maintain a premium feel that stands above that often found at this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html">price</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-tws-zne01-anc-fwd02-sport-140056623.html">point</a>. They visually remind me slightly of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Jabra Elite 75t</a>, but a little lower profile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of fit, that slightly more streamlined design means you don’t feel like something is balancing in your ear which can sometimes happen with more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html">rotund models</a>. As per usual they come with a charging case that promises four full charges of the TWS/1. The buds themselves offer around 6 hours per charge which holds true in my experience with ANC activated. Curiously, the buds are placed in the case with the right one to the left and vice versa. I’m not sure why this would be, but it does take some remembering (you’ll soon be reminded as the buds don’t fit the other way around).</p><p>In a world of me-too products, it’s hard to stand out. The easiest differentiator is price, then sound quality and or additional/premium features. It seems Grell Audio has tried to tackle all three of these, and with general success, I would say.</p><p>The price point puts the TWS/1 in an unusual category. Many premium brands are landing in the $250+ zone while more affordable options, like Google’s second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-2020-160030712.html">Pixel Buds</a> or the aforementioned Jabra’s live in the $150 area. Budget options, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">south of $100</a>, are also increasingly more common. This, then, pitches the TWS/1 at the overlap between high-mid and low-premium. I would wager this is entirely intentional as feature set and build quality skew higher end, but the barebones packaging and more accessible price indicate a more mainstream audience.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0f6c36c0-671f-11ec-bef1-df948f128588" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="bceea645-9345-3ff0-b8db-128f315bfb8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for sound quality, this is where things are a little more clear. In my testing, I was generally pleased with the default sound. It was perhaps a little on the thinner side for my personal preference with a slight weight on the lower end for a typically commercial sound. But Grell has partnered with SoundID – a third-party app that tunes select brands of headphones to your personal preference/hearing.</p><p>We’ve seen things like this before, most notably with Nura which takes this to a whole new level. SoundID is a little more understated in its approach. It still uses some form of hearing test, but rather than asking if you can hear certain tones, it simply plays you some music and asks “which do you prefer, A or B.” Once I completed this short test, the difference was night and day. With my own personal profile activated (it uploads to the headphones so it applies no matter what you are listening on), my usual mix of mid ‘10s indie and rave nonsense came alive.</p><p>I have a slight preference for dynamic range and beefier low and mid-high frequencies. At least, I presume I do because that was the biggest change in sound after completing the test and I instantly found them much more enjoyable. In the SoundID app, you can toggle between the default sound and your own profile and it really does make a huge difference. You don’t <em>need</em> the app to get good sound, but I’m going to guess that you’ll be happier with what it gives you.</p><p>Coincidentally, SoundID is also where you’ll get software updates for the TWS/1. I had one during my testing and it improved a few things including the slightly unresponsive touch controls. They’re still not reading my taps 1:1 but its about on par with most other touch-control buds I have used. Before the update, it was much more frustrating (or, maybe I just learned the technique?).</p><p>Those controls aren’t user-configurable, so you’re stuck with what Grell gives you. But, fortunately, that’s pretty much everything you’d want and without too many complicated tap or gesture combinations. Swiping forward or back on the left ear skips tracks, up or down on the right for volume, and so on. It was the single taps that I was having issues with which control play/pause on the right and transparency mode on the left – both of which are more annoying if not activated immediately.</p><p>This brings us on to smart(er) features. As mentioned, the TWS/1 has Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode – both of which are becoming increasingly standard. But there’s also a Noise Annoyance Reduction (NAR) mode. Grell explained to me during their initial announcement briefing that ANC is great for lower-frequency sustained noises, but doesn’t work as well for higher-frequency annoyances (think, crying baby on a plane). NAR is Grell’s own attempt at offering some reduction of these types of sound.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2e4d2ea0-671f-11ec-9fbf-1df5e18a8ea7" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="fb8ed1cd-6db0-3bef-903c-1f617f23d474"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In practice, I found it hard to pinpoint the difference that NAR makes. With ANC, it’s easy to hear the low rumble of the road outside my apartment decrease in volume. It’s maybe not the most powerful ANC I have heard but it does the job. With NAR, whatever the ear equivalent of squinting is, proved to be a little more indeterminate. It does seem to slightly improve the listening experience in combination with ANC, but it’s also hard to tell how much of that was me willing it to do so. It’s an interesting concept though and one that I hope Grell can continue to improve over time.</p><p>Other small perks include a “mono” mode (listening with just one bud). This isn’t as common as it should be in my opinion and it adds more flexibility for those that want to maintain some spatial awareness without having to wear both buds. It’s also, obviously, how some people prefer to handle their calls, too (reliving the Bluetooth headset days).</p><p>Another small added bonus is wireless charging “compatibility.” It’s not something I was able to test, but the more things that support it the better? Or, at the very least, it’s a nice perk for those already invested in the wireless charging world.</p><p>All in, Grell has given price, features and sound quality enough consideration that the result is a promising first product from an emerging brand. The price point, in particular, strikes a good balance between signaling premium ambitions without putting it too far out of reach for mainstream casuals. I’d love to see some further advances on the NAR technology and the controls could still be more responsive, but if you’re looking for a fresh set of true wireless headphones that are customizable to your taste, these are a great place to start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/grell-audio-tws-1-earbuds-review-200056428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">632d7a0f-a5bc-47db-939f-09aeff37a650</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640634616</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T19:52:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best apps to download on your new smartphone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You just got your hands on a new phone.

It doesn&#39;t have to be the one we recommend here. However, we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> for a handful of reasons. Not only will it let you generate strong passwords for all your online accounts, but it also has built-in support for two-factor authentication. That means you don&#39;t need to download a separate app like Authy to make your logins as secure as possible. If you have access to a Fastmail account, you can also use 1Password to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fastmail-1password-masked-email-110028257.html">generate random emails</a> for your logins, giving you another way to protect your privacy.

Partway through last year, Mozilla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-for-android-update-080007893.html">overhauled the Android version</a> of its browser to bring over many of its best desktop features to mobile. That release saw Mozilla add more robust support for third-party add-ons. It also brought over its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature, which stops trackers from misusing your browsing data. Separately, with Apple allowing you to change your default browser since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-ios-14-130014162.html">release of iOS 14</a>, there&#39;s never been a better time for iPhone users to liberate themselves from Safari.</p><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8" alt="Headspace" data-uuid="b34162df-637f-305c-81d9-be2428168b1f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>I subscribed to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace" href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace</a> at the start of the pandemic.

You&#39;ll find it also has a mix of music designed to help you focus and workouts for unwinding at the end of a long day. Across the board, everything it offers is excellent, and you&#39;ll find yourself turning to it for more than just peace of mind.</p><h2>Hopper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf24f1d0-5e8a-11ec-bff3-a8bc5d7992ed" alt="Hopper app" data-uuid="18136120-77c6-3e17-bf7e-9f554a857897"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hopper</div></figure><p>If you plan to fly somewhere soon, install <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hopper" href="https://fave.co/31AdPP0">Hopper</a> on your phone. While it has grown over the years to include a variety of features, at its core, Hopper is one of the best ways to save money on plane tickets. Once you tell the app where and when you want to fly, it’ll tell you whether you should book your flight now or wait. In the latter case, it’ll notify you when it estimates you&#39;ll get the best deal.

Add to that a meal planner, shopping lists and a tool for tracking the ingredients in your pantry, and you have an indispensable app for home cooks.</p><h2>Pocket Casts</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d991c6b0-5e8a-11ec-b69f-401c90e23326" alt="Pocket Casts app" data-uuid="d95444c2-35ed-393c-a323-38452f607168"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket Casts</div></figure><p>With podcasts becoming ever more popular with each passing year, there&#39;s a good chance you already have a handful of favorite shows you listen to every week. As much as Spotify would like to convince you it has the best podcast app, that distinction goes to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket Casts" href="https://fave.co/3lDMbrK">Pocket Casts</a>. We like it because it offers a consistently great experience across every system it supports. And if you use a mix of platforms from Apple, Google and Microsoft, you don&#39;t have to worry about syncing, either. It’s also nice to use software that doesn’t feel caught between two worlds in the way that Spotify does. Pocket Casts isn’t trying to be anything more than an app for listening to podcasts. That’s not something you can say of Spotify, and it’s often a source of frustration for those who turn to it for music.</p><h2>Pocket</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e72ebb20-5e8a-11ec-bbbd-79f45195740b" alt="Pocket app" data-uuid="6d6e1281-8451-31ed-9b77-8e3da3515923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket</div></figure><p>Another way to read more in 2022 is to download <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket" href="https://fave.co/3pv4alp">Pocket</a>. It&#39;s among the most popular read-it-later apps out there, allowing you to save articles you find online. Much like Pocket Casts, what makes this app compelling is that it offers a consistently excellent device-agnostic experience, making it a great option for those who haven&#39;t gone all-in on one ecosystem. Whether you use Chrome, Safari or Edge, you can install a browser extension to save articles you stumble upon. You can then read them later without distractions on your phone or tablet. Just don&#39;t forget to make a dent in your Pocket reading list occasionally.</p><h2>Telegram / Signal</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8c925c70-5e8b-11ec-bd73-3cebb4a8cffb" alt="Telegram app" data-uuid="cc4e6000-c3ef-39d7-b65e-0333105a8e20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Telegram</div></figure><p>We understand, asking your friends and family to install another messaging app on their phone can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task, but the effort has also never been more worth it. In <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Telegram" href="https://fave.co/3Ew10nt">Telegram</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Signal" href="https://fave.co/3rJxOWD">Signal</a>, you&#39;ll find two of the most secure chat apps on the market. We especially like Telegram here at Engadget because of how complete it feels from a feature standpoint. For example, it includes an edit feature that comes in handy when you make a typo, and a Secret Chat tool for when you want messages to disappear. If you do make the switch to Telegram or Signal, you&#39;ll also free yourself of the Meta ecosystem. That might not seem like much, but when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-outage-explainer-193155776.html">went down earlier this year</a>, it left many people without a way to communicate with their friends and loved ones.</p><h2>Tunnelbear</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/fbcd8330-c5df-11ea-9f7b-2d20663edfe1" alt="Tunnelbear for Android" data-uuid="ab882100-ea83-4399-b432-8032f85e94e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tunnelbear</div></figure><p>After a Password manager, one of the best tools you can use to safeguard your online privacy is a VPN. Again, there are many options out there, but we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:TunnelBear" href="https://fave.co/3FTjEHk">TunnelBear</a> for its simplicity and whimsical ursine theme. A VPN isn&#39;t as essential as a password manager, but you&#39;ll want to get one if you frequently find yourself traveling or using the public WiFi at places like cafes and libraries. Using a VPN in those contexts will ensure your connection is protected with encryption so that any information you send over remains safe and private.</p><h2>Snapseed</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/465381b0-5f46-11ec-b3ff-47f3a4374f8c" alt="Snapseed" data-uuid="5426a1fc-104d-37c1-9e2a-3044105fb545"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snapseed</div></figure><p>Most recent phones come with great cameras. Still, even with the latest iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, almost every photo can benefit from an edit before you share it. The options you have for photo editing apps are nearly endless, but if you want something that works well, look no further than <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Snapseed" href="https://fave.co/3oo9yHv">Snapseed</a>. It&#39;s an old favorite that offers a comprehensive suite of editing options but never gets bogged down in too many sliders and dials. Best of all, it makes it easy to save edits to your camera roll and upload them to apps like Instagram.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-apps-to-download-on-your-new-smartphone-ios-android-180049321.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e99bfad-2528-4914-92ca-34ae96e3f702</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639763702</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T17:55:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elisaveta Ivanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s ‘New World’ is among the year’s biggest money makers on Steam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has once again given some insight into the highest-earning games of the year on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam/">Steam</a>.

racing game fan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not much of a car guy, but I do enjoy a good drive on an open road and have at least a passing appreciation for a fine automobile. Of course, my beyond-humble Toyota Prius only offers so much in the way of driving thrills. A realistic racing game always sounded like a great way to scratch that driving itch, but they’re almost always just too involved and difficult for me.</p><p>But my colleague Jess Conditt described the Forza Horizon series as “the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles” in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html">her glowing preview of the game</a>. I was sold, and so far <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has entirely lived up to the hype and praise it has received.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A big part of the reason why is that it’s the most approachable driving game I’ve ever tried. Take the ingenious “rewind button.” At first, I would push the accelerator to the floor and rarely let up, which made actually taking a turn without wiping out damn near impossible. But the rewind button let me try these difficult turns again without completely blowing the race I’m in or having to start the entire thing over again. I think that it helped me get better at the game significantly faster than I would have if I had to re-do a course every time I blew a turn. Without it, I’m pretty sure I would have given up on <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> pretty quickly.</p><div id="0cfc6c1c2b044436822a7e2dafb6befb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>What I wanted out of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> was the ability to drive vintage and modern cars I’d never get a chance to own around a beautifully-rendered Mexican countryside, and the auto car-tuning feature was another thing that made this dream easy to achieve. For people who really want to dive into it, the game’s cars are extremely customizable — but I couldn’t be bothered to figure out exactly what anti-roll bars, tires, suspension systems and so on I needed to buy so my 2003 Volkswagen GTI R32 would keep up with the competition. (Note to Jess: GTI. Every. Time.)</p><p>Fortunately, there’s an auto-upgrade feature that can level up your car to the top of various tiers (C isn’t as great as A, which isn’t as great as S1, for example). Of course, you’ll need to pay for the parts, but it’s worth the cost to max out your vehicles of choice without spending all day figuring out exactly what parts to buy.</p><section data-eng-breakout="74cfc697af8f44648b03d669f13bc777" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bfbd20-6727-11ec-bdb9-363ef8275d64" alt="Forza Horizon 5"></section><p>In the frankly shocking amount of time I’ve poured into <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> already, I’ve been delighted to find a game with the perfect blend of serious driving challenge and realism coupled with tools and design that make it extremely appealing to someone like me, who doesn’t have the time or desire to endlessly tweak their car for every race. It’s a lot more realistic than most arcade-style racers, but it’s definitely not so unforgiving as to be inaccessible to people who aren’t racing nerds.</p><p>Whether you’re a novice like me or someone more experienced with racing games, you’ll find a ton to keep you busy. Ultimately, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> isn’t wildly different from open-world adventure games — there’s a “story” you can follow and unlock different chapters as you go, and there’s also a huge variety of different challenges spread all over the map. I gravitated towards road racing events, but there’s a huge variety of different courses. Others might prefer going off-road, trying drag racing or competing in events to rack up trick points.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7c73730-6727-11ec-affe-aef384e1a4ff" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="cbc95916-9508-3b3e-8d26-749b53d18879"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games/Microsoft</div></figure><p>Regardless of how you like to play, it’s also a beautiful game; I was stunned by the variety of scenery across this little corner of Mexico I got to explore. Coupling that with events taking place at all different types of day and in different weather conditions and there’s always something new to see. I’ve only played it on the Xbox Series S on a 1080p TV — I’m hoping I can give it a go on a Series X or well-tuned gaming PC soon and see just how good it can look with the right hardware. But even on my more modest setup, I’m enjoying this game in a way I never expected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-gaming-irl-racing-154527277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2194bbf-2c5b-45e1-a59f-7a6cdd3c344d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:45:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640618802</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T15:26:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Playground Games/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best accessories for your new Nintendo Switch OLED edition]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/3oyDiBw">Switch OLED</a> is out, and it’s a real beaut. It has a larger 7-inch screen, longer battery life and a few other welcome design improvements to its handheld gaming mode. I was impressed when I reviewed it back in October, and it’s been flying off store shelves since its release. It’s so hard to get one right now, in fact, that you may have to go to eBay to snag one before the holidays. But if you do have one — congrats! Now you probably want to make the most of your new system, and there are a few accessories that will go a long way toward making the Switch OLED a truly stellar console.</p><h2>SanDisk microSD card</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/feb6f7e0-584e-11ec-afdf-4512fd2e4daf" alt="SanDisk Nintendo Switch microSD card" data-uuid="25bafb89-6544-3e30-a6af-c36b302bdc51"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SanDisk</div></figure><p>With only 64GB of on-board storage, you’re going to want to get a microSD for your Switch OLED to store downloaded games, save files and screenshots.

You can use pretty much any microSD card with your Nintendo Switch, but the Nintendo-branded ones from SanDisk are solid, and you can get a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB model" href="https://amzn.to/31oG4QC">256GB model</a> at a pretty affordable rate right now.

All the concepts were created by LG Display (an independent sister company to LG Electronics) from 55-inch 1080p OLED panels with 40 percent transparency using its 8th-generation manufacturing process.&nbsp;</p><p>The most visually arresting model is the OLED Shelf that&#39;s built from two 55-inch transparent OLED displays mounted one above the other and topped by a shelf. The idea is that you could display artwork on one screen and a description of the art below, for example. It also has a sheet of opaque material that can roll down like a shade to make the display more like a standard, non-transparent OLED. At the same time, if the screens are turned off and the opaque material rolled up, you&#39;d be able to see objects behind the screen like actual paintings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e2e5bdc0-6704-11ec-bbfb-d21ccdbd9d46" style="height:1342;width:2000;" alt="LG Display&#39;s latest transparent &#39;shelf&#39; OLED can show virtual or real art" data-uuid="a64b3444-1cf7-35a8-ab64-2996fd32f876"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG Display</div></figure><p>The other displays are designed more for signage and commercial clients.

One <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html">recent one</a> speculated that the headset might depend on another device like an iPhone or a Mac computer.

They’re the sisters at the heart of Riot Games’ hit Netflix series, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html"><em>Arcane</em></a>, and they were picked for the spotlight out of a lineup of more than 150 <em>League of Legends </em>champions.</p><p>For <em>Arcane </em>creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee, the stars really couldn’t have been anyone else from <em>League of Legends</em> lore. Especially not Teemo. Linke and Yee have been preparing Jinx and Vi for their leading roles in a mature, mainstream, animated TV series for the past nine years, even if they didn’t know it the entire time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fad7f184b1fb41d4976f57dc602b07d4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Back in December 2012, Vi debuted and became the first <em>League of Legends</em> champion to receive a login screen complete with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEXoT9RMZ2E">original, lyrical song</a>. A year later, Jinx joined the game’s ranks and starred in its first character-driven cinematic, a high-energy music video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs"><em>Get Jinxed</em></a>. Linke and Yee worked on both of these releases, flexing their creative muscles in music and narrative storyboarding, two aspects that didn’t get much attention in the core game-development process.</p><p>The Jinx cinematic was also the first time Riot partnered with Fortiche Production, the studio behind <em>Arcane</em>’s otherworldly animation style.</p><p>“They kind of got our special treatment already because we just really liked them,” Linke told Engadget. “And so, when we had to think about like, which characters do we want to stick with for many years to come? I think it was pretty obvious.”</p><p>Yee agreed and added, “Both of them were a bit of a milestone, I think, for our time at Riot.”</p><div id="6e469dce6ea042968b9f787b060f79b5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nlJuwO0GDs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In-game, Jinx and Vi are sisters and bitter enemies, though this story fades into the background of the action, appearing only in small voice lines and character descriptions. As an online MOBA, narrative isn’t critical to the way <em>League of Legends</em> plays, but Riot has infused its champions with more lore over the years, focusing on expanding their universe beyond the game launcher.</p><p>Nowadays, Riot is a hub of creative development across multiple mediums, including short stories, graphic novels, cinematics, music videos and one truly fantastic K-pop group. <em>Arcane </em>is the studio’s biggest push onto a mainstream service, and Jinx and Vi carry the story, surrounded by a handful of other champions, including Caitlyn, Jayce and Viktor, and other original characters.</p><p>Jinx and Vi were always intriguing to Linke and Yee. They were grounded in a way that the game’s more fantastical champions weren’t, with distinct, opposing personalities and an unexplained rivalry that clearly cut both sisters to the core. Vi was a powerful, rigid Enforcer working for the prosperous city of Piltover, while Jinx was an anarchist with a belt full of bombs and no filter. Vi’s hair is short and pink, while Jinx’s is long and bright blue.</p><p>“If you just imagine those two characters together in a scene, whatever location, whatever they would be debating – you know, what kind of food they&#39;re going to get in the evening, or what kind of movie they&#39;re going to watch,” Linke said. “It&#39;s just always going to be fun, because they&#39;re always going to have these very different perspectives.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="b7780f86486844919a8bd7589f19b954" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" alt="Arcane"></section><p>There’s an inherent question in Jinx and Vi’s shared backstory, Yee said, and it’s a mystery that fans of the game and newcomers to the show would be able to grasp quickly: If they’re sisters, why do they hate each other so much? <em>Arcane </em>asks that question and slowly answers it, providing a rich, emotionally charged origin story for Jinx, Vi and their surrounding champions along the way.</p><p>“The fact that Jinx and Vi’s relationship is a bit of a mystery from the outset allows us to sort of satisfy both audiences,” Yee said.</p><p>In <em>Arcane</em>, Linke and Yee were able to zoom in and focus on the small details that bring their characters to life, showing micro-expressions and all-consuming rage on Jinx’s face, or giving Vi a nuanced nervous tick, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html">bouncing her leg</a>. Fortiche Production, the studio that handles animation duties for <em>Arcane </em>and other Riot projects, was a pivotal part of this development process. Animators there were given leeway to express themselves in the characters, Linke said, and this resulted in a unique visual style that flowed like motion-capture, even though it was completely hand-drawn.</p><p>“We also tried to really treat the animators like actors who can find their ways of expressing things, rather than just kind of saying, make Jinx or Vi do this,” Linke said. “But instead, just being like, here&#39;s what&#39;s going on in their head, how can we really make that feel real?”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec27fe0-642a-11ec-be3e-505c52e2c32b" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="a9d0d2a4-0021-3cef-8964-5c77e5772858"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p>After nearly 10 years of in-game development and cross-media projects, Jinx and Vi are still able to surprise Linke and Yee.

If you just received an Apple Watch, there’s a lot to do to make sure you’re getting the most out of your new wearable. Let us guide you through that process, from initial setup to optimizing everything it can do.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>Of course, the first thing you’ll want to do is pair your Apple Watch with your iPhone. Even if you have a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:cellular-capable Apple Watch" href="https://amzn.to/3J16Y2H">cellular-capable Apple Watch</a>, an iPhone is required for setting up and managing the device. Fortunately, this process is extremely straightforward — after powering on the Apple Watch, just place it near an unlocked iPhone and you’ll get a prompt to set the device up. During this process, your iPhone will walk you through the initial pairing as well as signing in with your Apple ID, assigning a passcode to your Watch, setting up things like Siri and Apple Pay, and deciding if you want to transfer your compatible apps to the Watch. I recommend against transferring all your apps automatically this first time, as the Watch is a lot more useful when you curate it with only what you <em>need</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/65a446d0-5f50-11ec-93df-91c4c5e63f67" alt="Apple Watch notifications" data-uuid="1ff7f25c-0927-3fd1-a90d-cb1c987441d8"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A few features you definitely should set up are fall detection and emergency SOS. The latter lets you quickly place a call to local emergency services by pressing and holding the side button, while fall detection uses the Watch’s accelerometers and other sensors to, well, detect if you’ve taken a bad spill. It’ll initiate an emergency SOS call automatically if it detects a fall and doesn’t detect you moving. Before making that call, the Watch will try its best to get your attention via a notification, a vibration and an audible alarm.</p><h2>The fun part: tweaking apps and notifications</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="3230d43e-c6c7-3d6c-a561-ba7d52b65502"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to make the Apple Watch your own. By default, the Apple Watch mirrors all notifications that go to your phone. But I’ve found the Watch to be much more useful with a bit of curation. In the iPhone Watch app, you can customize notifications for all of Apple’s first-party apps, or turn them off entirely. For example, the Activity app notifications panel lets you choose whether or not you want reminders to stand every hour, or notifications when your friends share activity milestones with you and so forth.</p><p>Third-party apps don’t have the same granularity, but you can turn them off so they won’t ping your Watch. For things that aren’t particularly time-sensitive (say, updates from Google Photos, or if you don’t want the Apple News app overloading your wrist), feel free to turn them off. They’ll still hit your iPhone, and you can always enable them again later.</p><p>The iPhone Watch app also lets you pick which specific apps from your iPhone will be installed on the Apple Watch. I think this is more useful than just letting the Watch install every single compatible app, because that might mean you have a few dozen apps to sift through on your Watch to see if they’re useful or not. Instead, I prefer going through the list and deciding if there’s a benefit to having these apps on my wrist. In the case of apps like Google Maps or Ecobee for controlling my thermostat, it’s a definite yes. But things like Etsy or Bank of America don’t exactly make a ton of sense on a Watch. And if you ever change your mind, you can remove an app from the Watch app or by long-pressing it in grid view and deleting it – just keep in mind that this will remove the app from your Watch but not from your iPhone.</p><p>That said, I have been surprised at what some developers have envisioned for the Apple Watch. Take the notes app Bear, for example. I often use it to make grocery lists, and checklists show up great on the Apple Watch. So if there’s an app on your phone that you consider essential, give it a shot on the Watch.</p><h2>Watch faces</h2><p>Another occasionally-overlooked part of the Apple Watch experience are watch faces. Since this is literally what you’ll see every time you raise your wrist, I think it’s worth finding ones that fit your personal style. While there are no third-party faces, the Apple Watch has more than 30 built-in options that are endlessly customizable. We’re talking about a huge variety of colors, different typefaces and watch face styles, complications (small slices of info like weather, date, or music controls) and much more. You can have a simple digital time display with nothing else, or an info-dense face with eight different complications or anything in between.</p><p>You can set up new faces on the Watch directly — but as with most in-depth features, it’s easier to do this on the iPhone. The Face Gallery shows every available face, along with multiple examples of how they can be customized. You can use those as a jumping off point to make your own creations. Once you’ve curated your favorites, you can simply swipe through them on the Watch itself when you want to mix things up. If you long press on a face, you can edit it directly on your Watch too, which is handy when you want to just change the color quickly to better match your outfit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/120c76d0-5f4d-11ec-ab3e-59df7abc5955" alt="Apple Watch faces" data-uuid="47e7f3a8-8998-3594-bd04-3f98828397d9"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re using an Apple Watch Series 5, 6 or 7, you can also decide whether you want to activate the always-on display. You can find this option in the settings app, under “Display &amp; Brightness.” If you’re after maximum battery life, turn this off, but most people will probably prefer it on. New watches can still get a full day of use while using the always-on feature, but once your watch ages a bit and battery performance degrades, you might want to learn to live without it.</p><h2>Fitness tracking</h2><p>One of the biggest Apple Watch selling points is its fitness-tracking features. Whether or not you actively exercise on a regular basis, the Watch will track your steps and activity level, and use that data to track your daily movement via three rings that you’re encouraged to close. The “move” ring is how many active calories you burn in a day, the “exercise” ring tracks activity at or above a brisk walk, and the “stand” ring tracks whether or not you get up and move for a minute or two each hour of the day.</p><p>When you set up your Apple Watch, it’ll suggest daily goals for each of these, and the Activity app (or the Fitness app on your iPhone) will show how close you are to hitting them. If you’ve never used an Apple Watch before, it’s fine to just go with the defaults — every week, you’ll get a recap of how you did and it’ll even suggest bumping up your Move number if you’re easily surpassing it. The exercise and stand options default to 30 minutes per day and 12 hours per day, but those too can be adjusted.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68b1b540-5f4d-11ec-a59a-4faf9cf1e6c3" alt="Apple Watch fitness" data-uuid="528d4bb8-2e73-33fd-aea3-11545b06cefc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For extra motivation, the Fitness app lets you connect with other friends who use an Apple Watch and see how much progress they’re making against their three rings. Naturally, you can use this information to taunt them about their couch-potato habits, but you can also challenge them to informal competitions. You earn points based on the percentage you close each of your rings every day, and the person with the most points after a week wins. It’s pretty casual, but it’s also a fun way to stay motivated.</p><p>If you want to track a specific workout, like a run, walk, or weight-training session you do that in the “workout” app. There, you’ll find the many different types of workouts that the Watch can track. If you already have a favorite way to track exercise on your phone, though, chances are you can find it for the Apple Watch too. Nike Run Club, MapMyRun, Peloton and others all have Watch apps that let you track workouts using the wearable’s sensors. Also, a lot of apps can now connect with the Health app on your iPhone. It’s a database of all your activity and workout data from your Watch, so you might be able to easily sync workout data from there into your service of choice. As with most things Apple Watch, it’ll just take a bit of playing around to see what works best for you.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>One of my favorite things about the Apple Watch is that it can stream music and podcasts – not just from Apple’s services but others like Spotify and Pandora as well. You’ll need a cellular-capable Watch to stream music without your phone, but the good news is that Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora all allow you to save music directly on the Watch as well. Regardless of whether you spring for the cellular model or not, there’s a way to listen to tunes and leave your phone behind.</p><p>If you’re an Apple Music user, you’ll manage downloaded music through the Watch app on your iPhone. Pop that open and go to the “Music” section and you’ll see a big button to add songs to your watch. There’s also a setting that’ll automatically download albums and playlists you’ve listened to recently – turn that on and you’ll always have some music on your wrist.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/14dc89f0-5f51-11ec-beff-76085033b240" alt="Apple Watch music" data-uuid="87e8579d-9aa3-3ac5-9b8a-6a88a485c81a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s easy to choose specific albums or playlists you want saved, too. Just hit the big plus button and you’ll see your Apple Music library. From there, just navigate to what you want, hit another plus button and it’ll be downloaded to your Watch. Note that music only transfers when your Watch is charging, so you’ll need to take it off your wrist to sync.</p><p>If you’re using Spotify, just navigate to an album, playlist or podcast on your phone and tap the three dots icon – you’ll see an option to “download to Apple Watch” there. Then, on your watch, there’s a clearly-marked “downloads” section where you can play content without a connection.</p><h2>Experiment, experiment, experiment!</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4" alt="The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="8da67b38-07aa-3973-a561-f883c426c7b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like many Apple products, the Apple Watch has a lot of functionality and hidden complexity beneath its user-friendly surface. But I’ve found that the Watch hides a lot of features, so it’s worth checking out the built-in Tips app for suggestions on what you can do. Without a guide like that, you’ll probably never realize that clicking the side button twice summons Apple Pay, or that you can display the grid of icons in a list if you prefer. Chances are good you’re not going to irrevocably mess something up, so tap and swipe and scroll and dig into the settings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-set-up-your-new-apple-watch-150031548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c12825f-1c7c-42a2-af55-02ab1d02351b</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 15:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640623211</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T16:41:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person's wrist, showing the screen's refracted edge and the watch's dial and button.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Amiga and the birth of 256-color gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With modern consoles offering gamers graphics so photorealistic that they blur the line between CGI and reality, it&#39;s easy forget just how cartoonishly blocky they were in the 8-bit era.

In the excerpt below, Davis explains how the industry made its technological leap from 8- to 12-bit graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52bfe620-3dac-11ec-bb7f-2ca9252fc43d" alt="qbert" data-uuid="6878a9f0-0a21-345e-af42-28e8f8b7151f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Santa Monica Press</div></figure><p>©2021 Santa Monica Press</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Back at my regular day job, I became particularly fascinated with a new product that came out for the Amiga computer: a video digitizer made by a company called A-Squared. Let’s unpack all that slowly.</p><p>The Amiga was a recently released home computer capable of unprecedented graphics and sound: 4,096 colors! Eight-bit stereo sound! There were image manipulation programs for it that could do things no other computer, including the IBM PC, could do. We had one at Williams not only because of its capabilities, but also because our own Jack Haeger, an immensely talented artist who’d worked on Sinistar at Williams a few years earlier, was also the art director for the Amiga design team.</p><p>Video digitization is the process of grabbing a video image from some video source, like a camera or a videotape, and converting it into pixel data that a computer system (or video game) could use. A full-color photograph might contain millions of colors, many just subtly different from one another. Even though the Amiga could only display 4,096 colors, that was enough to see an image on its monitor that looked almost perfectly photographic.</p><p>Our video game system still could only display 16 colors total. At that level, photographic images were just not possible. But we (and by that I mean everyone working in the video game industry) knew that would change. As memory became cheaper and processors faster, we knew that 256-color systems would soon be possible. In fact, when I started looking into digitized video, our hardware designer, Mark Loffredo, was already playing around with ideas for a new 256-color hardware system.</p><p>Let’s talk about color resolution for a second. Come on, you know you want to. No worries if you don’t, though, you can skip these next few paragraphs if you like. Color resolution is the number of colors a computer system is capable of displaying. And it’s all tied in to memory. For example, our video game system could display 16 colors. But artists weren’t locked into 16 specific colors. The hardware used a “palette.” Artists could choose from a fairly wide range of colors, but only 16 of them could be saved in the palette at any given time. Those colors could be programmed to change while a game was running. In fact, changing colors in a palette dynamically allowed for a common technique used in old video games called “color cycling.”</p><p>For the hardware to know what color to display at each pixel location, each pixel on the screen had to be identified as one of those 16 colors in the palette. The collection of memory that contained the color values for every pixel on the screen was called “screen memory.” Numerically, it takes 4 bits (half a byte) to represent 16 numbers (trust me on the math here), so if 4 bits = 1 pixel, then 1 byte of memory could hold 2 pixels. By contrast, if you wanted to be able to display 256 colors, it would take 8 bits to represent 256 numbers. That’s 1 byte (or 8 bits) per pixel.</p><p>So you’d need twice as much screen memory to display 256 colors as you would to display 16. Memory wasn’t cheap, though, and game manufacturers wanted to keep costs down as much as possible. So memory prices had to drop before management approved doubling the screen memory.</p><p>Today we take for granted color resolutions of 24 bits per pixel (which potentially allows up to 16,777,216 colors and true photographic quality). But back then, 256 colors seemed like such a luxury. Even though it didn’t approach the 4,096 colors of the Amiga, I was convinced that such a system could result in close to photo-realistic images. And the idea of having movie-quality images in a video game was very exciting to me, so I pitched to management the advantages of getting a head start on this technology. They agreed and bought the digitizer for me to play around with.</p><p>The Amiga’s digitizer was crude. Very crude. It came with a piece of hardware that plugged into the Amiga on one end, and to the video output of a black-and-white surveillance camera (sold separately) on the other. The camera needed to be mounted on a tripod so it didn’t move. You pointed it at something (that also couldn’t move), and put a color wheel between the camera and the subject. The color wheel was a circular piece of plastic divided into quarters with different tints: red, green, blue, and clear.</p><p>When you started the digitizing process, a motor turned the color wheel very slowly, and in about thirty to forty seconds you had a full-color digitized image of your subject. “Full-color” on the Amiga meant 4 bits of red, green, and blue—or 12-bit color, resulting in a total of 4,096 colors possible.</p><p>It’s hard to believe just how exciting this was! At that time, it was like something from science fiction. And the coolness of it wasn’t so much how it worked (because it was pretty damn clunky) but the potential that was there. The Amiga digitizer wasn’t practical—the camera and subject needed to be still for so long, and the time it took to grab each image made the process mind-numbingly slow—but just having the ability to produce 12-bit images at all enabled me to start exploring algorithms for color reduction.</p><p>Color reduction is the process of taking an image with a lot of colors (say, up to the 16,777,216 possible colors in a 24-bit image) and finding a smaller number of colors (say, 256) to best represent that image. If you could do that, then those 256 colors would form a palette, and every pixel in the image would be represented by a number—an “index” that pointed to one of the colors in that palette. As I mentioned earlier, with a palette of 256 colors, each index could fit into a single byte.</p><p>But I needed an algorithm to figure out how to pick the best 256 colors out of the thousands that might be present in a digitized image. Since there was no internet back then, I went to libraries and began combing through academic journals and technical magazines, searching for research done in this area. Eventually, I found some! There were numerous papers written on the subject, each outlining a different approach, some easier to understand than others. Over the next few weeks, I implemented a few of these algorithms for generating 256 color palettes using test images from the Amiga digitizer. Some gave better results than others. Images that were inherently monochromatic looked the best, since many of the 256 colors could be allotted to different shades of a single color.</p><p>During this time, Loffredo was busy developing his 256-color hardware. His plan was to support multiple circuit boards, which could be inserted into slots as needed, much like a PC. A single board would give you one surface plane to draw on. A second board gave you two planes, foreground and background, and so on. With enough planes, and by having each plane scroll horizontally at a slightly different rate, you could give the illusion of depth in a side-scrolling game.</p><p>All was moving along smoothly until the day word came down that Eugene Jarvis had completed his MBA and was returning to Williams to head up the video department. This was big news! I think most people were pretty excited about this. I know I was, because despite our movement toward 256-color hardware, the video department was still without a strong leader at the helm. Eugene, given his already legendary status at Williams, was the perfect person to take the lead, partly because he had some strong ideas of where to take the department, and also due to management’s faith in him. Whereas anybody else would have to convince management to go along with an idea, Eugene pretty much had carte blanche in their eyes. Once he was back, he told management what we needed to do and they made sure he, and we, had the resources to do it.</p><p>This meant, however, that Loffredo’s planar hardware system was toast. Eugene had his own ideas, and everyone quickly jumped on board. He wanted to create a 256-color system based on a new CPU chip from Texas Instruments, the 34010 GSP (Graphics System Processor). The 34010 was revolutionary in that it included graphics-related features within its core. Normally, CPUs would have no direct connection to the graphics portion of the hardware, though there might be some co-processor to handle graphics chores (such as Williams’ proprietary VLSI blitter). But the 34010 had that capability on board, obviating the need for a graphics co-processor.</p><p>Looking at the 34010’s specs, however, revealed that the speed of its graphics functions, while well-suited for light graphics work such as spreadsheets and word processors, was certainly not fast enough for pushing pixels the way we needed. So Mark Loffredo went back to the drawing board to design a VLSI blitter chip for the new system.</p><p>Around this time, a new piece of hardware arrived in the marketplace that signaled the next generation of video digitizing. It was called the Image Capture Board (ICB), and it was developed by a group within AT&amp;T called the EPICenter (which eventually split from AT&amp;T and became Truevision). The ICB was one of three boards offered, the others being the VDA (Video Display Adapter, with no digitizing capability) and the Targa (which came in three different configurations: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 24-bit). The ICB came with a piece of software called TIPS that allowed you to digitize images and do some minor editing on them. All of these boards were designed to plug in to an internal slot on a PC running MS-DOS, the original text-based operating system for the IBM PC. (You may be wondering . . . where was Windows? Windows 1.0 was introduced in 1985, but it was terribly clunky and not widely used or accepted. Windows really didn’t achieve any kind of popularity until version 3.0, which arrived in 1990, a few years after the release of Truvision’s boards.)</p><p>A little bit of trivia: the TGA file format that’s still around today (though not as popular as it once was) was created by Truevision for the TARGA series of boards. The ICB was a huge leap forward from the Amiga digitizer in that you could use a color video camera (no more black-and-white camera or color wheel), and the time to grab a frame was drastically reduced—not quite instantaneous, as I recall, but only a second or two, rather than thirty or forty seconds. And it internally stored colors as 16-bits, rather than 12 like the Amiga. This meant 5 bits each of red, green, and blue—the same that our game hardware used—resulting in a true-color image of up to 32,768 colors, rather than 4,096. Palette reduction would still be a crucial step in the process. The greatest thing about the Truevision boards was they came with a Software Development Kit (SDK), which meant I could write my own software to control the board, tailoring it to my specific needs. This was truly amazing! Once again, I was so excited about the possibilities that my head was spinning.</p><p>I think it’s safe to say that most people making video games in those days thought about the future. We realized that the speed and memory limitations we were forced to work under were a temporary constraint. We realized that whether the video game industry was a fad or not, we were at the forefront of a new form of storytelling. Maybe this was a little more true for me because of my interest in filmmaking, or maybe not. But my experiences so far in the game industry fueled my imagination about what might come. And for me, the holy grail was interactive movies. The notion of telling a story in which the player was not a passive viewer but an active participant was extremely compelling. People were already experimenting with it under the constraints of current technology. Zork and the rest of Infocom’s text adventure games were probably the earliest examples, and more would follow with every improvement in technology. But what I didn’t know was if the technology needed to achieve my end goal—fully interactive movies with film-quality graphics—would ever be possible in my lifetime. I didn’t dwell on these visions of the future. They were just thoughts in my head. Yet, while it’s nice to dream, at some point you’ve got to come back down to earth. If you don’t take the one step in front of you, you can be sure you’ll never reach your ultimate destination, wherever that may be.</p><p>I dove into the task and began learning the specific capabilities of the board, as well as its limitations. With the first iteration of my software, which I dubbed WTARG (“W” for Williams, “TARG” for TARGA), you could grab a single image from either a live camera or a videotape. I added a few different palette reduction algorithms so you could try each and find the best palette for that image. More importantly, I added the ability to find the best palette for a group of images, since all the images of an animation needed to have a consistent look. There was no chroma key functionality in those early boards, so artists would have to erase the background manually. I added some tools to help them do that.</p><p>This was a far cry from what I ultimately hoped for, which was a system where we could point a camera at live actors and instantly have an animation of their action running on our game hardware. But it was a start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-creating-qbert-and-other-classic-video-arcade-games-warren-davis-santa-monica-press-163011566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42f3d1c1-fecb-4ad5-acbb-85a35670f6dd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638995207</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T20:27:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Detail of the logo on a vintage 1980's Commodore Amiga 500 personal computer and games console, taken on September 14, 2016.

Inefficiencies in the form of heavy battery packs and low power densities have long limited not just the range and performance of EVs but the very forms they can take — there’s a reason Tesla started with a Roadster and not a Cybertruck. But steady advancements in power systems over the past few years — alongside skyrocketing demand for larger, electrified vehicles which cater to the US market — has led to a watershed moment in 2021: the emergence of EV pickups and SUVs.</p><p>Yes, we all know the Model X exists and Tesla “did it first” — spare me your tweets — however, the sheer number and variety of new, pure EV pickup and SUV models either ready to hit the showroom floor or in active development is staggering compared to just a few years ago. Let’s take a look at some of this year’s standouts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GM is betting big on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">proprietary Ultium battery</a> technology, investing $35 billion in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gms-hands-free-super-cruise-is-coming-to-six-more-cadillacs-in-2022-040101614.html">self-driving</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">EV technologies</a> through 2025. The company has also announced that it intends to sell 30 EV models by the end of 2025 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-to-exclusively-sell-zero-emissions-cars-by-2035-164418993.html">EVs exclusively after 2035</a> with the 1,000 horsepower <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html">GMC Hummer EV</a> serving as its vanguard offering.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6174e590-4805-11ec-bfb7-854c6c1c0eb7" style="height:2065;width:3097;" alt="U.S. President Joe Biden drives a Hummer EV as he tours the General Motors &#39;Factory ZERO&#39; electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan, U.S. November 17, 2021.

More than 10,000 potential buyers had placed down payments on the $112,000 Hummer Edition 1 <a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/21/gmc-hummer-ev-surprising-number-pre-orders-increase-production/">by last December</a>. Similarly, the Hummer’s EV SUV variant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmcs-newly-unveiled-hummer-ev-suv-is-830-hp-of-electric-supertruck-220323684.html">revealed in April</a> had its pre-orders sell out in <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-gmc-hummer-ev-edition-1-suv-sales/"><em>minutes</em></a> — not bad for a vehicle that won’t actually hit the streets until Fall 2023. Deliveries for the Hummer EV pickup are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-deliveries-december-101042969.html">slated to begin this month</a>. There have even been rumblings about adapting the Hummer EV frame and power system <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-hummer-ev-military-vehicle-elrv-181909646.html">to military applications</a>, though no firm decisions on that proposal have yet been made.</p><p>Hummers are only the start. In April, GM confirmed that its second EV model will be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-electric-silverado-043134066.html">an electrified Silverado</a>. We still don’t know a whole lot about the Silverado beyond that it will leverage GM’s Ultium battery tech, that the company is aiming for a 400-plus mile range, and that the EV pickup will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-shows-off-four-wheel-steering-on-the-upcoming-silverado-ev-190022577.html">offer four-wheel steering</a>, which shortens turn radius’ at low speeds and increases cornering stability at high speeds — especially when towing loads.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll have a full accounting of the Silverado’s capabilities once it makes its official debut during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-electric-silverado-debut-ces-2022-045915793.html">GM’s CES 2022 keynote address</a>. What’s more, GM teased its third upcoming EV in July — a full-size GMC pickup, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-third-electric-pickup-truck-ahead-of-hummer-ev-production.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. Virtually nothing else is known about it at this time, not even if it will use the existing GMC Sierra branding. Hopefully, we’ll get some more hints in the new year.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the Stellantis Group (formerly FCA and umbrella company to Chrysler, Jeep Dodge, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and a host of others) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/stellantis-to-invest-35point5-billion-in-evs-and-new-technologies-by-2025.html">announced in July</a> that it, too, will be investing $35 billion towards its electrification efforts through 2025 and will have 55 electrified vehicles (40 BEVs, 15 PHEVs) available in the US and European markets by the end of that year. What’s more, Stellantis is working on an all-electric Ram EV to compete with the Silverado and Ford F-150 Lightning, though the Ram isn’t expected to be released until 2024. For its part in 2021, Jeep showed off a slick-looking <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeeps-all-electric-wrangler-concept-has-a-six-speed-manual-transmission-122031458.html">Wrangler BEV concept in March</a>, released its “light hybrid” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-sahara-4-xe-phev-first-drive-174554804.html">Wrangler Sahara 4XE in May</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-2022-grand-cherokee-4xe-debut-september-29-173239673.html">debuted its PHEV Cherokee 4XE</a> in September ahead of the vehicle’s 2022 release.</p><p>Ford also had a year worthy of honking its own horn about, starting with the February release of the Mustang Mach-E. The EV was met with <a href="http://v/">a bit of trepidation to start</a> but cemented its position with the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html">performance-focused GT edition</a>. In all, Ford had sold more 21,000 Mach-E units through this past October, despite a handful of recalls for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mustang-mach-e-recall-222632366.html">loose bolts</a> and “deep sleeping” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-battery-issue-212744852.html">software bugs</a>. That’s not bad for a first-year crossover SUV working to get past deeply ingrained customer nostalgia, but the Mach-E’s numbers are nothing compared to the hype Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning EV has garnered.</p><p>The company’s F-150 electrification efforts have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds.html">hardly been an industry secret</a> but when <a href="http://v/">Ford debuted the Lightning</a> on May 19th (or May 18th if you were watching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">President Biden’s speech</a>), America’s car-buying public just about lost its mind with nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-pre-order-reservation-jim-farley-162653871.html">45,000 people signing up to preorder</a> the EV pickup within the first 48 hours.</p><div id="6a1621ebaf4146b4b0902711a82cd98b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More than 44,500 reservations in less than 48 hours...and counting.

Granted, those folks weren’t obligated to place a down payment so whether all those pre-orders translate into actual sales — or folks just decide to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html">restomod their existing ICE Fords with the eluminator system</a> instead — remains to be seen.</p><p>Some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">biggest headlines</a> in the 2021 EV truck space came from stellar startup, Rivian. While competitors like Lordstown Motors found themselves <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">critically low on cash</a> and the subject of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-investigation-lordstown-motors-184638125.html">Justice Department fraud investigations</a>, Rivian has already hit its first production milestone: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">actually producing vehicles</a> (despite having to push its initial delivery window from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html">July</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">September</a>). But that’s not the half of it.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, the company also announced plans to install 10,000 charging stations across <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-charger-network-us-canada-2023-210428781.html">North America by 2023</a>, unveiled <a href="http://v/">a membership plan for owners</a> offering both Roadside and off-Roadside Assistance as well as exclusive OTA software updates, and outlined its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-service-plan-143206646.html">Remote Care program</a> which would offer remote diagnoses and on-site repairs for the electric trucks. The startup has big plans for the future as well. It announced plans to invest $5 billion in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-second-factory-capacity-battery-cells-193825530.html">a second US-based production plant</a> and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-uk-ev-factory-plans-193124496.html">reportedly eyeing the UK</a> as the site for its first international battery facility.</p><p>Some of those future plans will involve partnerships with other companies such as Amazon — which owns a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-20-percent-stake-rivian-185007669.html">20 percent stake in Rivian</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-jeff-bezos-amazon-climate-change-paris-agreement.html">purchased 100,000 vehicles from the startup in 2019</a> and has already begun making deliveries in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-vehicles-are-making-deliveries-in-la-132506234.html">Los Angeles</a> with them — but they won’t include Ford. Despite investing half a billion dollars in the EV startup two years ago, Ford announced in November that the two companies will no longer collaborate on an upcoming EV. Looks like that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lincoln-cancels-rivian-based-ev-004105043.html">rumored electric Lincoln</a> will likely stay dead for the time being.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/89b35c80-5313-11ec-bcf5-af21cdef94e2" style="height:2744;width:4800;" alt="The Rivian R1T arrives on stage as a 2022 Truck of the Year Finalist at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California on November 17, 2021.

BROWN via Getty Images</div></figure><p>On the other end of the headline spectrum is, surprisingly, Tesla. Despite the company’s massively profitable year, the development of its Cybertruck has been slow going. While CEO Elon Musk announced in January that “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">volume production</a>” of the EV SUV will begin in 2022, <a href="http://v/">it’s increasingly looking like</a> that will happen later in the year — after Ford’s F-150 Lightning and GMC’s Hummer EV hit the roads, both of which debuted well after the Cybertruck did.</p><p>Of course, American automakers are far from the only ones getting in on the EV game. Mercedes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-will-launch-the-eqb-electric-ev-in-the-us-in-2022-084031973.html">announced in April</a> that its EQB compact SUV is nearly ready for production and will go on sale in the US next year. Its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-sustaineer-electric-delivery-van-concept-215050891.html">Sustainer</a>” delivery van concept, however, might take a bit longer to reach the market. Hyundai, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-striking-ioniq-5-delivers-long-range-and-brisk-performance-093212320.html">unveiled its Ioniq 5 SUV in February</a> with plans to release it this winter alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-genesis-brand-will-switch-entirely-to-electric-powertrains-in-2025-182802371.html">promises that its Genesis line of vehicles</a> will go entirely electric by the middle of this decade. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-2021-niro-ev-164152474.html">Kia’s Niro EV continues to be a low-key sleeper hit</a>.</p><p>We’ve seen much hype and grandiose promises about EV pickup trucks and SUVs over the last few years but 2022 will be the year when everything comes out in the wash. Consumers will finally be able to see these vehicles on the streets, in their neighborhoods, and likely breathing down their necks while stuck in traffic, rather than just on a showroom floor or livestream presentation stage. This is a huge opportunity for automakers to further evangelize the benefits of battery electrics over their internal combustion predecessors — this time using America’s favorite type of vehicle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2021-showed-us-that-trucks-and-suvs-dont-need-gas-engines-160020378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ba3c234-f081-40cb-82b3-ca83c10e60c8</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640260359</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum.

However, it delayed the launch until today due to last-minute inspections and a lack of favorable weather. Still, what&#39;s a few days for such an important, long-in-the-works mission?

You can watch the entire event unfold, beginning with pre-launch coverage, starting at 3AM ET. The space agency will broadcast the launch on its <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive">NASA Live</a> website, as well as on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nasa">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa">Twitch</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Understandably, there’s a lot of excitement for the JWST to finally make its way into space. Not only will a successful launch represent the end of a tumultuous 14-year development cycle, but the telescope, with its far more advanced sensors than Hubble, will afford astronomers to glimpse at black holes and early galaxies in a way they haven’t been able to do in the past.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-000021158.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cbd5cdf7-819d-4019-a21e-dec8f605cb98</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 22:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640378547</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T20:42:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/83e07d50-5d5a-11ec-befd-b01af6c1217d" width="3500" height="2330" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/83e07d50-5d5a-11ec-befd-b01af6c1217d" width="3500" height="2330" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA NASA / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Sunshield test unit to be used on NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is stacked and expanded at a cleanroom in the Northrop Grumman facility in Redondo Beach, California, in this NASA handout picture released July 25, 2014.

The storage can be controlled by XPG&#39;s gaming software app. &quot;Gaming Launcher software... promises to make your gaming libraries conveniently portable and [add] a higher level of game integration with XPG Prime Software Ecosystem,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It looks like a pretty normal mouse, though it&#39;d require a pretty stout USB-C cable to support those kind of speeds. It&#39;s not the worst idea we&#39;ve heard, because it gives you some high-speed storage while freeing up a USB slot that&#39;d normally be taken by a wired mouse. XPG didn&#39;t mention the mouse&#39;s DPI or any other gaming specs.&nbsp;</p><p>Mice with built-in USB storage <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-storage-mouse-does-double-duty/">aren&#39;t unheard of</a>, though we haven&#39;t seen anything notable recently. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-smart-mask-oled-gaming-chair-193027315.html">Wild gadgets</a> often pop up at CES, however, helping companies grab some attention and publicity. Aside from the prototype mouse, XPG also unveiled some products that could come to market next year including PCIe Gen5X SSDs, DDR5 DRAM and the XPG Wired/Wireless Alpha gaming mouse.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xpg-mouse-with-ssd-inside-210055310.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">633d241b-5032-4cfd-a700-7161710d05e0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 21:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640353570</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T13:46:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Electronics Accessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d99bc130-64be-11ec-bbda-fa99dbecfce2" width="1000" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d99bc130-64be-11ec-bbda-fa99dbecfce2" width="1000" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[XPG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[XPG's mouse has an SSD so you can store your games in it]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[XPG's mouse has an SSD so you can store your games in it]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
