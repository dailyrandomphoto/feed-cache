But buying a game for someone else is a different matter entirely to choosing one for yourself. Unless you know exactly what they want, where do you even begin?</p><p>Well, we&#39;d begin by thinking about what your loved one’s into, outside of gaming. Could they do with something to help them chill out every night? Do they love a good story, something that moves them? Are they a board game freak? Maybe they&#39;re passionate about romancing Greek gods? OK, that last one&#39;s pretty unlikely, but we hope there&#39;s a little something for everyone here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><em>Hades</em></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/99cfad40-2dce-11ec-bbae-5f687769538f" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

Because you can finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hades-xbox-series-x-xbox-one-ps4-ps5-on-august-13-th-175208533.html">play it on everything</a>. Over the summer, the game launched across both generations of Xbox and Playstation consoles, joining the PC and Switch versions.</p><p>Buy <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hades" href="https://amzn.to/3FI0F1Y">Hades</a> on PS5 or Xbox Series X, and you’ll get a version that can reach 60 fps in 4K. Whichever platform you play on, expect a game filled with varied enemies, playthroughs that are never the same twice, and an ingenious Boon system that augments a strong selection of weapons with extra powers, effects and new moves.</p><p>You’ll soon decide your favorite godly ally (and weapon of the underworld), but making it to the end of Hades demands you build some affinity for most skills and techniques, as Boons are randomly granted each run. The game centers around dying, learning and doing it all over again. And again. And again. <em>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FI0F1Y" id="b74b05bace8048f5ad282be04363b99f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hades (PS5) at Amazon - $35</a><h2><em>Hollow Knight</em></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/99cbdcb0-2dce-11ec-bfec-5899086d058c" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

As it is, it’s still a great time to acquaint yourself with the original which came out — first on PC — back in 2017. Thanks to its Metroidvania playstyle (explore, earn new abilities, use abilities to explore even further) and its cute bug cartoon looks, it remains a classic. To explore the world of Hollow Knight, you’ll need half-decent reflexes to both explore dangerous environments and survive encounters with much bigger bugs. The story is lightly woven into your exploration, and while things can feel a little bleak  — it’s a moody looking game — there’s plenty of funny little moments and characters to meet.</p><p>Depending on your console of choice, it’s also often discounted.

Still, this points to a future where an airport or favorite restaurant can provide an assistant that&#39;s (hopefully) useful without seeming too robotic.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-ai-voice-avatar-omniverse-project-tokkio-142456487.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9303bcd6-a08e-4816-a7b3-78ec3ba3d81e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 14:24:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636467898</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T14:25:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e38a840-4160-11ec-a7f5-89406dc123a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5e38a840-4160-11ec-a7f5-89406dc123a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar toy version of Jensen Huang]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar toy version of Jensen Huang]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Buds 2 are on sale for $100 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s affordable Galaxy Buds 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">impressed us</a> with all of the premium features they offer at a decent $150 price tag.

Notably, these buds have solid sound quality plus active noise-cancellation and an adjustable ambient sound mode. While the ANC isn&#39;t as strong on these buds as some more expensive models, it still blocks out most environmental noise well. They also have a small, comfortable design that&#39;s easy to wear for hours on end, and with their five-hour battery life (with ANC turned on), you&#39;ll be able to do just that. We also appreciate that their case supports wireless charging — something that&#39;s often left out of affordable wireless earbuds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest caveat with the Buds 2 is that they&#39;re best for Android users, and particularly great for those with Samsung smartphones. Whereas other Samsung earbuds offer better integration with iOS, the Buds 2 focus on Android. Sure, you <em>could</em> use the Buds 2 with an iPhone or an iPad, but you&#39;ll be stuck with the default settings. If you or someone on your holiday gift list is an Android users in need of a new pair of earbuds, the Galaxy Buds 2 are a solid option — especially at this sale price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-are-on-sale-for-100-right-now-141102918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45738882-704b-4b83-83b5-fa2a0a8d67a4</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 14:11:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636467064</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T14:11:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d43930-faa6-11eb-bfff-007b5841bd5a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d43930-faa6-11eb-bfff-007b5841bd5a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

The company changed that equation with the current Pixelbook Go, a premium yet affordable Chromebook with performance to spare.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The design is more basic than the sophisticated glass-and-aluminum designs that came before it. While it&#39;s around the same weight as the previous Pixelbook, it&#39;s considerably thicker and more rounded. It&#39;s arguably more practical, though, thanks to the easy-to-grip ridged base and display that you can open with just one hand.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, it shines where it counts. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-google-pixelbook-go-review.html">Engadget review</a>, we noted that the Pixelbook Go delivered good performance and battery life, outshining most Chromebook models out there. That&#39;s helped by the Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB or 16GB of RAM, which is more than enough to power Chrome OS. It also comes with an excellent keyboard that offers plenty of travel.&nbsp;</p><p>The only drawbacks are a 1080p display that&#39;s not quite as good as the original and a trackpad that isn&#39;t the smoothest. Still, for the sale price of $749, the Pixel Go i5 is easily one of the best Chromebooks you can get.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixelbook-go-i-5-falls-to-an-all-time-low-at-amazon-132316033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc49f658-6bea-459f-804b-22e2e5702bf6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 13:23:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636464200</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T13:23:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/13366730-4159-11ec-bffe-91a5bdf24e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/13366730-4159-11ec-bffe-91a5bdf24e9a" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google's Pixelbook Go i5 falls to an all-time low at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google's Pixelbook Go i5 falls to an all-time low at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon will accept Venmo payments starting in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting next year, you&#39;ll be able to use the money anybody <a href="https://www.engadget.com/venmo-payment-app-redesign-160045898.html">Venmos</a> you to buy products directly from Amazon — so long as you live in the US.

Now for the first time, the company is introducing a vertical home feed featuring images of dishes and more, designed to help people discover local restaurants.&nbsp;</p><p>The feed will first and foremost feature &quot;popular dishes and other trending photos from consumers, including food photos or interior and exterior shots of the restaurants,&quot; Yelp said. Much like Google and other types of news feeds, the content shown is based on your proximity to the business, the freshness of content and a dish&#39;s popularity.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you click on a restaurant&#39;s dish, you&#39;ll be directed to see more photos and reviews of that dish.

Clicking on other images, like the interior or exterior of a restaurant, will take you to the business page and show you more photos and info.</p><p>The other feature, Yelp Connect, is a paid feature for restaurant owners. It allows businesses to share updates with new and existing customers directly to home feed, helping their posts gain visibility (and Yelp more ad revenue, no doubt). Yelp said that it&#39;s initial testing showed it may lift a restaurant&#39;s consumer engagement up to 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>The new experience is arriving today on iOS exclusively in 150 cities in 25 US states, Yelp said.

The streaming giant is reportedly launching &quot;Kids Clips&quot; on its iOS app, which will show short video clips from its library of children&#39;s programming to help young viewers find something to watch. Bloomberg says the feature builds upon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html">Fast Laughs</a>, the comedy feed it launched earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike Fast Laughs, however, Kids Clips videos will be horizontal instead of vertical and will take over the entire screen. In addition, kids will only be able to view 10 to 20 clips at any one time. Netflix will add new clips every day based on the current shows and movies available on the platform, as well as future ones slated to arrive on the service. Both features are part of the company&#39;s efforts to combat decision fatigue, which ails many of its subscribers. Netflix also launched a shuffle play feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-android-launch-140045356.html">Play Something</a> back in October to help viewers find something to watch based on their viewing patterns without having to scroll endlessly through the app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix still refers Kids Clips as a &quot;test,&quot; <em>Bloomberg</em> said, and it won&#39;t be available to all its users just yet.

Apparently, the firm expects the attacker to target and extort other companies and organizations over the coming months.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-users-compromised-security-breach-063802932.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d0dacc10-65c6-4cd6-82f0-96b4159864a3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 06:38:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636439907</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T06:38:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4ae97f0-4121-11ec-bf7f-f91f216a21ef" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4ae97f0-4121-11ec-bf7f-f91f216a21ef" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[towfiqu ahamed via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of hacker hand stealing data from digital tablet.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Close up of hacker hand stealing data from digital tablet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google can now find your pet's doppelgänger in works of art]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2018, the Google Arts &amp; Culture app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-15-googles-museum-app-finds-your-fine-art-doppelganger.html"><ins>introduced a feature</ins></a> that looks your doppelgänger in works of art.

Once the conversation was over, it was over. That helped build an air of exclusivity around Clubhouse’s audio chat rooms, especially in the earlier days where only influencers and celebrities had access to the app.</p><p>But now, the company seems to have changed its tune. Clubhouse has just <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/clubhouse-replays-room-recording/"><ins>announced a new feature</ins></a> called Replay, where users can choose to record the audio chat and then save it to a club or profile. They can be downloaded and shared externally too, just in case someone wants to use it as a podcast or a TikTok soundtrack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c05c44d401044ac997dffb96ebc4e340"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the best of live ✨ but later! <br><br>Replays are here and they&#39;re so much more than just a recording. Creators can download audio, and when you listen on Clubhouse, you&#39;ll see all the dynamics of the stage, PTRs, *and* hop from speaker to speaker.<br><br>live now on iOS &amp; Android 💖 <a href="https://t.co/zDtenNy60c">pic.twitter.com/zDtenNy60c</a></p>— Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1457798431175430149?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Replay will also support <a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/introducing-pinned-links-so-many-new-ways-to-use-rooms/">pinned links</a>, a recent feature that allows chat moderators to link out to different sites during a conversation. Those links will remain fully interactive to those who are listening to the recording later on as well.</p><p>Listeners to a recorded conversation can skip to the next speaker, pause, scrub, or make a 30-second clip. They can also listen to it at 1.5 or 2x speed. However, be aware that creators will be able to see who’s listening to their Replays. They’ll also be able to have a “total room count” to see how many people in total — both live and recorded — listened to the room. Starting next week, Replays will appear on Clubhouse’s discovery pages, which includes search.</p><p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/08/clubhouse-record-room-replay/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> points out, Replay is obviously great for those who don’t have time to catch a live audio event, which in turn makes Clubhouse more appealing to those with busy schedules. As Clubhouse gets more competition such as Twitter Spaces and Facebook’s Live Audio Rooms, it’ll likely need even more features to help differentiate itself from its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-replay-215630367.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37d6d10a-eb50-4713-a03d-d692a945ddaa</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 21:56:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636407714</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T21:41:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a82865a0-7c5b-11eb-92ef-30897adf6e8b" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a82865a0-7c5b-11eb-92ef-30897adf6e8b" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/03/01: In this photo illustration the Clubhouse logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen.

The first, nicknamed Genoa, is built for general-purpose computing and packs up to 96 cores (thanks in part to a 5nm process) as well as support for DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 peripherals. It arrives sometime in 2022, and partners are sampling chips now.</p><p>The star of the show, however, may be Bergamo. It&#39;s designed for cloud computing and emphasizes core density — AMD is promising up to 128 cores in a single CPU. The design relies on a modified Zen 4c architecture (the C is for &quot;cloud&quot;) that offers similar functionality, but optimizes cache and power consumption to boost the core count and offer as many processing threads as possible. Bergamo doesn&#39;t surface until the first half of 2023, but it may be useful for internet giants juggling many simultaneous users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you were expecting news on Zen 4-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-5700g-5600g-apu-radeon-sale-030010401.html">Ryzen processors</a>, you&#39;ll be disappointed. AMD was unsurprisingly focused on corporate customers at its event, and there was no mention of mainstream parts. With that said, it won&#39;t be at all surprising if AMD shares more about next-gen Ryzen hardware in the months ahead.</p><div id="8cd84085ade9405682f25aa66728a31d"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECHhuvuiNzs?start=1915" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-zen-4-genoa-bergamo-cpu-191633260.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0bc86597-d571-4864-9a7c-5b8f7e8b9a7d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 19:16:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636398995</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T19:16:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6683b230-40c3-11ec-bedf-64be774248ca" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6683b230-40c3-11ec-bedf-64be774248ca" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AMD, YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD Bergamo CPU based on Zen 4 architecture]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD Bergamo CPU based on Zen 4 architecture]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paramount+ expands its soccer lineup with Women's Super League matches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/7mnXVr">Paramount+</a> is bolstering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-afc-soccer-120008376.html">its soccer bonafides</a> with the addition of another notable league.

You&#39;d have a top-level Community chat with smaller group chats tied to it — for instance, you could have a Community for a college course with study group chats linked to that parent.</p><p>All of the chats would behave much like they do today, with end-to-end encryption.

Batteries, capacity overbuilding and other storage options could increase that figure.</p><p>A blend of wind and solar power should be enough to meet most of the current energy needs in &quot;advanced, industrialized nations,&quot; <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2021/11/05/wind-and-solar-could-power-the-worlds-major-countries-most-of-the-time/"><ins>according to the study</ins></a>. Researchers from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), China’s Tsinghua University, the Carnegie Institution for Science and Caltech looked at 39 years of hourly energy demand data from 42 countries to determine whether there&#39;s enough wind and solar resources to meet requirements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They found that most reliable systems, in which wind power is most prevalent, can meet energy needs in the countries they studied between 72 and 91 percent of the time, and that&#39;s before any storage considerations. Add the capacity to store up to 12 hours&#39; worth of energy, and these renewable energy sources can meet between 83 and 94 percent of hourly energy needs. However, the researchers noted even when wind and solar sources can power over 90 percent of a region&#39;s energy needs, there would still be hundreds of hours per year where demand isn&#39;t met.</p><p>“Wind and solar could meet more than 80 percent of demand in many places without crazy amounts of storage or excess generating capacity, which is the critical point,” co-author Steven Davis, professor of Earth system science at UCI, said. “But depending on the country, there may be many multi-day periods throughout the year when some demand will need to be met by energy storage and other non-fossil energy sources in a zero-carbon future.”</p><p>There are geophysical challenges at play. The paper suggests it would be easier for larger countries closer to the equator to fully switch to sustainable power sources, since they can more reliably bank on having solar energy all year long. Germany, for instance, might struggle to meet most of its needs through wind and solar, since it&#39;s a relatively smaller country at a higher latitude.</p><p>One solution would be for neighboring countries to pool their resources. &quot;A lot of consistency and reliability could be provided by a system that includes solar resources from Spain, Italy and Greece with bountiful wind available in the Netherlands, Denmark and the Baltic region,&quot; Dan Tong, assistant professor of Earth system science at Tsinghua University and lead author on the paper, said.</p><p>Many countries are cutting back on their reliance on fossil fuels, which is key to mitigating carbon emissions and limiting the impact of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/climate%20change/"><ins>climate change</ins></a>. Europe generated more electricity from renewable sources in 2020 than it did from fossil fuels, according to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-renewables-overtake-fossil-fuels-ember-agora-energiewende-111045685.html"><ins>a report</ins></a> from two green energy-focused think tanks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wind-solar-energy-needs-study-172901659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b69c3463-81f5-4d54-9bd7-95d1a8162be4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 17:29:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636392543</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T17:29:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e02920a0-40b6-11ec-9aef-8dab9d724b63" width="3740" height="2153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e02920a0-40b6-11ec-9aef-8dab9d724b63" width="3740" height="2153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Denis Balibouse / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A windmill is pictured in front of the Gries lake at SwissWinds farm, Europe's highest wind farm at 2500m, near the Nufenen Pass in Gries, Switzerland, October 25, 2021.
