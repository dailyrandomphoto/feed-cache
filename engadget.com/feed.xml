The chip inside the wearable won&#39;t be as powerful as Apple&#39;s in-house chips and will lack the Neural Engine used to accelerate AI tasks. It&#39;ll be made on a 5-nanometer process that will seem old by the time the headset is available, according to one contact.</p><p>The chip will reportedly have a CPU and GPU, leaving open the possibility for a weaker stand-alone mode like you see with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2</a>. However, the hardware is supposedly optimized for processing and transmitting the headset&#39;s camera imagery over a wireless link, with a focus on battery life. Apple is rumored to be using &quot;ultrahigh-resolution&quot; (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-price-specs-rumor-145412503.html">possibly 8K</a> per eye) displays, with cameras to match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headset may still be a long way off. Apple supposedly just completed &quot;tape-out&quot; (that is, completed the physical design) for the main chip, display driver and image sensor. Trial production will take a while, let alone the mass production needed for a shipping product.</p><p><em>Information</em> had heard the device might not be ready until 2022 at best, and might launch later. It&#39;s believed to be aimed at developers and creators with a potential price around $3,000. Any truly consumer-oriented hardware might have to wait until a possible set of AR glasses launching in 2023 or later.</p><p>Apple declined to comment. With that said, there are signs the company is edging closer to releasing the headset. The company recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-dan-riccio-vr-ar-headsets-162030193.html">shuffled executives</a>, with senior VP Dan Riccio tipped to lead a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-hardware-svp-224019387.html">new project</a> that might center on the headgear. In other words, years of development <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-26-apple-buys-eye-tracking-glasses-company.html">and acquisitions</a> are finally bearing fruit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ae13212-88a2-4abf-a130-deb87aff0eb0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 17:59:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630605225</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T17:53:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e4774130-0c15-11ec-ad0c-446340229fc9" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e4774130-0c15-11ec-ad0c-446340229fc9" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 mini against a camera lens]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 mini against a camera lens]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic's 'Unity 23' flight will be its first for commercial research]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virgin Galactic announced on Wednesday that its upcoming &quot;Unity 23&quot; mission will include the first commercial research payload in the company&#39;s launch history ‚Äî that payload being three paying passengers from the Italian Air Force.</p><p>The IAF members have teamed with the National Research Council to study the effects on the human body of transitioning from full 1G gravity to the microgravity felt in orbit.

It features AMD&#39;s latest processor, NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 30-series GPUs, and a responsive 14-inch display, but it wraps all of that together in a sub-four-pound package. What&#39;s not to love? While Razer&#39;s 13-inch Blade Stealth is even lighter, I&#39;ve always found it to be woefully underpowered and dramatically overpriced. But the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Blade 14" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Blade 14</a> represents what Razer does best: delivering powerful hardware that feels more polished than the competition.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="de99fac5-4390-4b37-a839-85db110314d7"/><p>Imagine a shrunken-down version of the Blade 15, and you&#39;ve pretty much got the 14-inch. It has the same sleek black aluminum case, and a minimalist aesthetic that resembles Apple&#39;s MacBook Pro more than a typical gaming laptop. That, of course, has been Razer&#39;s major accomplishment over the last few years: Its computers are still the closest Windows users can get to Apple&#39;s polished hardware. The only major feature that screams &quot;gaming laptop&quot; is the Blade 14&#39;s RGB LED keyboard, which allows every key to display its own color (something you can also turn off easily, too).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like most 14-inch gaming laptops these days, the Blade 14&#39;s biggest selling point is that it&#39;s lighter than most 15-inch notebooks. Here&#39;s where Razer&#39;s own innovations start to work against it, though. The Blade 15 currently weighs around 4.4 pounds, whereas the 14 clocks in at 3.9 pounds. That&#39;s only a half-pound difference, something that could be noticeable if you were comparing these laptops in each hand, but less so in normal usage. The Blade 14 would have seemed more impressive when the 15-inch model was upwards of 4.6 pounds, but now it&#39;s actually a bit hefty compared to competitors like the 3.5-pound ASUS Zephyrus G14.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time that Razer has had a 14-inch laptop either, which takes some of the luster away from the Blade 14. The last model dropped around three years ago, toting a 7th-gen Intel CPU and weak NVIDIA GTX 1650 graphics. What makes this new version stand out is under the hood. It&#39;s the first time Razer has used an AMD processor ‚Äî every Blade 15 comes with the powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX ‚Äî and it also has NVIDIA&#39;s fastest RTX 30 graphics.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433cc310-0c08-11ec-b24f-c9f4612ef9dd" alt="Razer Blade 14" data-uuid="e10e0957-cbed-3c3e-823d-23e70437cd12"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, it&#39;s worth noting even those graphics cards are constrained by the Blade 14&#39;s size. NVIDIA lets every PC maker tweak the wattage of their GPUs, which is helpful for dealing with thermal constraints, but that also means performance can vary wildly. Basically, not every RTX 3080 is created equal, especially when it comes to gaming laptops. Keep that caveat in mind, because it&#39;ll explain some of the performance benchmarks I ended up seeing.</p><p>Our review unit was the most expensive configuration, a $2,800 build with the Ryzen 9 5900HX, RTX 3080, 16GB of fixed RAM, 1TB SSD, and a quad HD 165Hz display Given that caliber hardware, the Blade 14 had no troubling handling demanding games and torturous benchmarks. In <em>Destiny 2</em>, reached up to 120fps while playing in 1,440p with maxed-out settings. It also looked smooth on the laptop&#39;s 14-inch screen, with excellent color reproduction and solid brightness. Ray tracing performance was also solid; I was able to see between 60 and 70fps in <em>Control </em>while playing in 1,440p with maxed graphics, DLSS and medium ray tracing.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 14 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA RTX 3080)</p></td><td><p>6,551</p></td><td><p>4,418</p></td><td><p>1,443/7,226</p></td><td><p>3 Gb/s / 2GB/s </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, AMD Radeon RX 6800M)</p></td><td><p>6,992</p></td><td><p>5,189</p></td><td><p>1,457/7,691</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s / 1.5 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G15 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>6,881</p></td><td><p>4,530</p></td><td><p>1,426/7,267</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.85 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 Stealth (2021, Intel i7-10870H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,369</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247/6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s / 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G14 (AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, NVIDIA RTX 2060 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,436</p></td><td><p>2,725</p></td><td><p>1,189/7,705</p></td><td><p>1.7 GB/s / 1.67 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Still, I definitely noticed the compromises Razer had to make to squeeze the RTX 3080 into such a small case. It was slower than the larger Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, equipped with an RTX 3070 GPU, in all of our 3DMark tests and Geekbench 5&#39;s compute benchmark. Clearly, Lenovo was able to squeeze out more performance from what&#39;s supposed to be a slower GPU. Compared to the ASUS Zephyrus G15, which has a Ryzen 9 5900HS and an RTX 3080, the Blade 15 lags behind slightly in all of our 3D benchmarks.</p><p>I also noticed that the Blade 14 could get toasty, with its CPU reaching up to 94 degrees Celsius when I really stressed it out. It&#39;s rare for me to see processors going beyond 85 Celsius in gaming notebooks today, so that was particularly surprising. There were times when the bottom of the Blade 14 felt too hot to touch. I was glad that the GPU generally stayed below 84 Celsius under load, which is more in line with competitors. Despite running so hot, it lasted 10 hours and 50 minutes in our battery benchmark. That‚Äôs mainly for productivity tasks, though. Expect it to last a lot less if you‚Äôre gaming unplugged.</p><section data-eng-breakout="eaff90eae90646688c716974b9a75fb3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433e22a0-0c08-11ec-b8fe-3f00575f5905" alt="Razer Blade 14"></section><p>The Blade 14&#39;s case size also has implications for its keyboard. While it looks and feels just like Razer&#39;s existing laptop designs, with a satisfying amount of key travel and responsiveness, the layout is far more cramped than the Blade 15. That led to a bit of finger pain after extended <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Overwatch </em>sessions. Maybe I&#39;m just becoming less dexterous in my older age, but I think that alone could be a dealbreaker for some gamers. You&#39;re going to be hitting those WASD keys quite a bit in shooters, after all.</p><p>Port-wise, the Blade 14 crams in most of what you&#39;d want: two USB-C 3.2 connections with charging; two USB 3.2 Type A sockets; a full-sized HDMI port; a headphone jack; and a custom power cable. It&#39;s definitely nice to be able to charge up using a normal USB-C cable, but those won&#39;t be powerful enough to juice up while gaming. Thankfully, the Blade 14&#39;s bundled power adapter is relatively small, unlike the bricks that gaming laptops used to come with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433dd481-0c08-11ec-bb7a-0004be265470" alt="Razer Blade 14" data-uuid="2de92852-3418-33ed-b54b-064e4b7bbfe4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As usual, I would have liked to see an SD card reader, but that&#39;s just another reason to consider the larger Razer notebooks. Similarly, the Blade 14 doesn&#39;t have upgradable RAM, which means you&#39;re stuck with the 16GB of memory it comes with. You can upgrade the NVMe SSD, but you&#39;ll be limited to 2TB. The Blade 15 and 17, meanwhile, let you add more RAM and up to two NVMe SSDs.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Blade 14 starts at $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Blade 14 starts at $1,800</a> with an RTX 3060 and a 1080p 144Hz screen. Given that price point, I&#39;d recommend the Blade 15 for most shoppers. You&#39;d get a larger screen, more customizable and faster hardware, as well as fewer thermal restrictions. And when it comes to 14-inch competition, the ASUS Zephyrus G14 is another solid choice (though I&#39;d give Razer the upper hand when it comes to long-term reliability).</p><p>Still, there‚Äôs a lot to love about the Blade 14. More so than the overpriced Blade Stealth 13, this new model is a light laptop that&#39;ll satisfy most of your hardware demands. So if you&#39;re in love with the idea of a sub-four-pound Blade, and don&#39;t mind the compromises involved, then go with the gaming gods.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">779af9a9-1ada-4c0f-ae8f-963eb8ff75a1</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 17:30:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630606031</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T18:07:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5250d30-0c17-11ec-bb9d-b01dad4d87c7" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5250d30-0c17-11ec-bb9d-b01dad4d87c7" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer Blade 14]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Blade 14]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook expands access to licensed music for game streams]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook%20gaming">Facebook Gaming</a> is letting more creators play licensed music in the background while streaming gameplay.

However, you&#39;ll also get to play the legendary <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> (the original, not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-120044800.html">the remake</a>) on PS Now starting September 7th.</p><p>The rest are titles that will help PS Now catch up to Xbox Game Pass, where they&#39;ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-microsoft-final-fantasy-xbox-game-pass.html">been available for a while</a>. <em>Final Fantasy VIII Remastered</em> hits Sony&#39;s service on October 5th, while <em>IX</em> (arguably the PS1&#39;s curtain call) debuts November 2nd.

The company is bringing OLED screens to all of its new models, a move meant to differentiate them in the increasingly crowded PC market. Compared to traditional LCD screens, OLED offers deeper blacks levels, vastly better contrast, and more responsiveness. Even today, as LCDs have evolved to be brighter and faster, OLED offers a more pronounced visual &quot;pop.&quot;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="40117edd-f1e2-4e34-aeac-3861b40e603a"/><p>We&#39;ve been seeing notebooks with OLED for years, like on the XPS 15 and ZenBook, but they&#39;ve typically been positioned as a premium feature for select models. Now ASUS is trying to make its name synonymous with OLED, so much so that it&#39;s bringing it to new mid-range notebooks like the VivoBook Pro 14X and 16X. It&#39;s also touting the first 16-inch 4K OLED HDR screens on notebooks across several models: the ProArt Studiobook Pro, ProArt Studiobook and the Vivobook Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Befitting its name, you can expect to see the fastest hardware on the market in the StudioBook Pro 16 OLED (starting at $2,500). It&#39;ll be powered by H-series Ryzen 5000 processors, 3rd-gen Intel Xeon chips and NVIDIA&#39;s professional-grade RTX A2000 and A5000 GPUs. And if you don&#39;t need all of that power, there&#39;s also the Studiobook 16 OLED ($2,000), which has the same Ryzen chips, Intel Core i7 CPUs and either RTX 3070 or 3060 graphics. Both notebooks will be equipped with 4K OLED HDR screens that reach up to 550 nits and cover 100 percent of DCI-P3 color gamut. They&#39;ll also sport ASUS Dial, a new rotary accessory located at the top of their trackpads, offering similar functionality to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-26-surface-dial-is-a-physical-scroll-wheel-for-your-digital-art.html">Microsoft&#39;s forgotten Surface Dial</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f5e43a0-0baa-11ec-beff-c2cd0ac81efc" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16" data-uuid="2ad06851-3efa-3f45-974e-bcf6bb6cbb2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>Stepping down another level, there&#39;s the the latest ZenBook Pro Duo 15 OLED, the company&#39;s 15-inch dual-screen notebook. That can be equipped with up to RTX 3070 graphics and a core i9 CPU. While they seemed gimmicky at first, ASUS has proven it can make dual-display notebooks genuinely useful, as we saw in our review of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-2021-dual-screen-notebook-163024528.html">Zenbook Pro Duo</a>. The single-screen ZenBook Pro 15 OLED ($1,470), meanwhile, tops out with RTX 3050 Ti graphics and Ryzen 5000 processors.</p><p>The Vivobook Pro 14X and 16X OLED ($1,400) are entirely new territory for ASUS, sitting above the mainstream Vivobook line, but below the more premium Zenbook. I suppose at this point, with consumers eager to snap up more PCs, having additional models won&#39;t hurt. The 16X will come with up to a 4K 16-inch OLED screen, while the 14X has a 2.8K OLED 90Hz option. You&#39;ll be able to choose from Intel Core i7 or Ryzen 5000 H-series chips and up to RTX 3050 Ti graphics. And, not to be forgotten, the Vivobook Pro 14 and 15 OLED offer similar power in cases that weigh 3.09 pounds and 3.64 pounds, respectively.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f5df580-0baa-11ec-9ffa-acd44bc6c85c" alt="ASUS Vivobook Pro 14X" data-uuid="f6dd1dc7-e4fa-330a-9f20-e41d2a4577c8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>ASUS&#39;s new notebooks are expected to be available in North America in Q4.

The Google-owned brand said it had racked up a combined 50 million YouTube Premium and Music subscribers roughly a year and a half after reaching the 20 million mark. It&#39;s also the &quot;fastest growing&quot; music subscription service, according to YouTube&#39;s music chief Lyor Cohen.</p><p>Certain markets were stronger than others. Cohen touted &quot;impressive growth&quot; in Brazil, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea. He didn&#39;t provide numbers for those countries or the US.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That figure still makes YouTube smaller than Spotify, which claimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-q2-2021-premium-users-103530500.html">165 million Premium subscribers</a> as of June 2021. Apple hasn&#39;t divulged its Music subscriber numbers since June 2019, when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-apple-music-60-million-paid-subscribers.html">had 60 million</a>, while Amazon last <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-music-has-more-than-55-million-customers-worldwide">touted</a> 55 million Music customers (only some of them paying for Unlimited) in January 2020. Still, these figures in isolation would suggest YouTube is quickly becoming a major force in music streaming.</p><p>There are concerns about the claims, though. YouTube didn&#39;t indicate how many were Music or Premium subscribers, or how they used it. While you get YouTube Music with a Premium subscription, that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re using Premium for music ‚Äî you might just want to get rid of ads and download videos. YouTube&#39;s tally also includes people using free trials, so the number of paying customers is likely lower. Samsung offers two to four months of free YouTube Premium access with new phones, for instance, but many of those users will drop Premium after the trial is over.</p><p>The data still hints competition in the music streaming world is heating up, with relatively small outfits like YouTube and Amazon Music posing more of a threat to incumbents like Spotify and Apple.

For a DC Comics-endorsed restaurant, it‚Äôs light on the cringe theme-restaurant tropes.</p><p>But there‚Äôs some spectacle ‚Äî and a lot of love for DC ‚Äî hidden beneath all the fine trappings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Opening earlier this month in the center of London, Park Row is pitched as a dining experience that takes you to Gotham without the need to wear a costume. In fact, the restaurant‚Äôs FAQ <a href="https://parkrowlondon.co.uk/park-row-faq/">notes</a> ‚ÄúDress more Bruce than Batman,‚Äù and there‚Äôs actually a ban on people cosplaying inside the venue.</p><p>I‚Äôve visited both tech-laced and themed restaurants for work and pleasure, and Park Row feels a little different, in that it seems entirely made for grown-ups. The idea is simple enough: DC universe meets fine dining, with an immersive high-tech experience inside the Monarch Theater (named after where Batman‚Äôs parents were shot) as the showstopper event. Bookable in advance, its ¬£200 ($275) tasting menu is a barrage of 11 themed courses that guide patrons through the heroes and villains of DC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67340d00-0bea-11ec-bffe-93799ad987d6" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London" data-uuid="2e27373d-dbb3-38c2-84f8-59d5e32a89e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Adding some high-tech bells and whistles to restaurants isn‚Äôt anything new. There are several restaurants and pop-ups that have played with projection mapping meant to showcase and amplify the food on the plates, dining rooms with carefully set-dressed courses and lurid surroundings.</p><p>The Monarch Theater is all of it put together in a single room. When it‚Äôs not showtime, it looks like, well, a conference room. A long, white room with a long, white table in the middle. Aside from the projectors, dotted around the ceiling, it doesn‚Äôt look like a room built for immersive superhero dining.</p><section data-eng-breakout="ac53a00b09bb4719aed5b27577cf56ec" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dc5bda30-0beb-11ec-bdbd-2bca9d7584f7" alt="Park Row&#39;s Monarch Theater"></section><p>I can‚Äôt tell you every beat of the multi-course experience because I didn‚Äôt actually get to test it when I visited. Seating 20 customers, there are two services each day.  Post-launch, the team has since expanded the Monarch Theater part for four sittings per day.</p><p>The team wants to keep some of the courses‚Äô mystique, but I can touch on some of the showpiece parts. The glossy, plain table betrays what‚Äôs been packed inside. Park Row doesn‚Äôt use projectors for embellishing the dishes or the food. I‚Äôm told by a spokesperson that this would distract from the food itself. Instead, the projectors send diners barreling into insane asylum padded cells that vertiginously rotate, making light fittings all pile together in a corner. I‚Äôm quickly shown the same room coated in neon graffiti; then wrapped in ivy vines and a final vista high in the clouds.</p><p>Any DC Comics dilettante can assume which characters these projections point to. But it goes on from there. The unassuming conference table (ironically, Cisco was apparently involved with connecting everything together) hides more secrets. Two rails run across the center of the table, making it easier to transform the table when it comes to the Poison Ivy course, which centers around a platter of plants, which seem to be a mix of living and artificial. Within this, serving staff dress the logs and plants with drinks, mysterious edibles and things that I‚Äôd call nibbles, but I probably shouldn‚Äôt. Some of them are borderline hidden, which seems to be by design.</p><p>Below these rails, a heating element runs the length of the table. Customers are given a playing card during an earlier course, and are told to lay this on the table. As the experience progresses, the card reacts to the heat of the table, revealing a secret message to each diner.</p><p>There are other tricks that aren‚Äôt entirely revealed to me, including a floating plate trick that I‚Äôll have to book my own reservation to see.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67340d01-0bea-11ec-bfe8-f2a4f0b6165b" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London" data-uuid="001ed686-c678-330b-9b4d-4124f4856ad6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Outside of the Monarch Theater, Park Row is split up into several different zones, all serving the same food menu ‚Äî modern European ‚Äî in a different facet of a fictional Gotham dining scene. From the entrance, modeled after Wayne Manor, you descend a glowing staircase inspired by a Batcave, through a vapor-emitting door frame into Pennyfeathers, a whiskey bar named after Alfred, Bruce Wayne‚Äôs long-serving butler. Beyond that, the Iceberg Lounge has a frozen penguin statue towering the bar, while to the left, the Rogue‚Äôs Gallery is curated by Catwoman, decorated with reproductions of some of the world‚Äôs most famous stolen art pieces, each one marked by a rogue from DC‚Äôs back catalog of villains.</p><p>One of these artworks, bizarrely, doubles as a drinks decanter. Now get ready for a deep cut ‚Äî it‚Äôs the same painting used in the 1989 Batman movie. DC fans can probably easily discern which villain has marked each painting, but it‚Äôs the nods like this that elevate the whole thing for fans that are able to recall <em>everything</em>.  Ordering the fish and chips will result in a blue-tinged piece of battered fish ‚Äî hinting at when the Joker poisoned Gotham Harbour. The most egregious nod might be the dessert menu. One dish is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMD2TwRvuoU">Kiss from A Rose</a>. A little on the nose, but only because everything else is so subtle.</p><p>There are a few molecular gastronomy tricks, too, like edible balloons and freeze-dried popcorn that billow smoke out your mouth as you crunch. It&#39;s these touches that add to the ambiance and fun of the place, and defuses the impression that Park Row may take itself a little <em>too</em> seriously for something based on comic book source material.</p><section data-eng-breakout="f9be461ae84b45c28ba0422c0f97cfbb" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67018b50-0bea-11ec-befb-8bb646365e6c" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London"></section><p>Even the restrooms are a playful tribute to the Joker and his minions, all neon signs and bright lights, while paintings around the restaurants give oblique nods to Gotham and its residents. The menus, too, have little symbols that represent DC villains. These touches are there if you look for them, but they‚Äôre not obvious ‚Äî which is good for those of us that don‚Äôt want to see anything more superhero-related ever again. I think the point is you could bring a date who has zero interest in the DC universe and capes, and they‚Äôd think it‚Äôs a glossy, central London restaurant.  Fortunately, the food should be good enough to stand on its own, with an executive chef from a Michelin-starred restaurant. The restaurateur behind it all is known for his work with Heston Blumenthal‚Äôs Fat Duck.</p><p>The food has the credentials ‚Äî and prices ‚Äî to ensure even if you couldn‚Äôt care less about DC, at least you‚Äôll have a good meal and a ridiculous cocktail or two.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dc-comics-park-row-london-gotham-restaurant-review-153100566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df41015f-ada5-46cf-8c28-edf6f234126f</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630595749</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T15:15:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/673bae21-0bea-11ec-abfa-33a016cc66dc" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/673bae21-0bea-11ec-abfa-33a016cc66dc" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith, Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC bans spyware company SpyFone and its CEO from the surveillance industry]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ftc"><ins>Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> has banned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spyware"><ins>spyware</ins></a> maker SpyFone and its CEO Scott Zuckerman from operating in the surveillance industry.

The messaging service allegedly failed to live up to its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) transparency obligations.</p><p>The Commission also said the data sharing itself violated GDPR. WhatsApp was merely storing &quot;pseudonymous&quot; phone number data, for instance, rather than truly anonymizing it. While the numbers were stored using lossy hashes, WhatsApp had the hash key needed to decrypt that info ‚Äî it could tie that number to a specific person if it wanted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ruling asked WhatsApp to both improve its transparency and bring the data sharing in line with the GDPR. The Irish agency initially planned to fine WhatsApp ‚Ç¨50 million ($59.3 million) for breaking GDPR, but hiked the punishment after Germany and other countries accused the Commission of being lenient on privacy violations.</p><p>WhatsApp unsurprisingly planned to appeal the decision. It claimed that it met transparency requirements in 2018 (around when the investigation began) and that the fines were &quot;entirely disproportionate.&quot; It maintained that it strived to offer &quot;transparent and comprehensive&quot; information to users.</p><p>The fine is the latest in a string of penalties for tech giants over violations. Amazon faced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fine-eu-data-privacy-130443268.html">record $888 million fine</a> in July over GDPR issues, and Twitter was asked to pay ‚Ç¨450 million ($533.6 million) when it failed to report a data leak within 72 hours. WhatsApp&#39;s fine is light by comparison, then, although it&#39;s arguably <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-wont-limit-accounts-dont-accept-privacy-policy-160132557.html">grappling with a larger blowback</a> over its data policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-eu-fine-facebook-data-sharing-144749929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee556b9a-083d-4dd4-be7b-361ea4ad84a5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:47:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630594071</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T14:47:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/07c13190-6f5f-11eb-b217-91175144ecf8" width="3334" height="2324" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/07c13190-6f5f-11eb-b217-91175144ecf8" width="3334" height="2324" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D printed Whatsapp and Facebook logos are placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken January 21, 2021.

Now every manufacturer has at least one, making even some of the most jaded tech reviewers exclaim ‚Äúhow did they do this?‚Äù</p><p>But, even with the ubiquity of ultraportable laptops, some continue to stand out for their ability to balance sleek designs with powerful performance. As with any else, though, the best ultraportable laptops still demand some sacrifices. We‚Äôre here to help you decide which ones are worth making.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What to expect</h2><p>The first thing to remember is that the term ‚Äúultraportable‚Äù is subjective. There aren‚Äôt any hard-and-fast rules governing the weight and thickness. We at Engadget define an ultraportable laptop as one that weighs less than three pounds and measures less than 0.75 inch thick at its widest point. Usually that means you‚Äôre talking about 13-inch and 14-inch laptops, though occasionally a 15-inch device hits the mark too.</p><p>Most ultraportables have high-end design touches like ultra-slim bezels, gem-cut edges, and premium materials because they tend to sit at the top of the line. Companies spend a lot of time and money engineering them to be as thin and light as possible without sacrificing too much on power and battery life. They tend to be made from metal, carbon fiber or a mix of the two, and their enclosures are usually just thick enough to include the latest Intel or Ryzen processors, large batteries and enough RAM and storage for most people‚Äôs needs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/98e7c4a0-eb92-11ea-b3fb-e2e6726b0a03" alt="Dell XPS 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>What you won‚Äôt find in most ultraportables are high-powered GPUs or loads of ports. Most have integrated graphics chips (think: Intel UHD) because anything more powerful would take up space and pose heat-management problems. When it comes to ports, the edges of these laptops simply don‚Äôt have a lot of free space. You‚Äôre almost guaranteed to get a couple Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C ports on the newest notebooks, but some have already abandoned the USB-A standard, which is a shame.</p><p>Also, due to the flagship caliber of most ultraportables, you can expect to pay top dollar for these. Most start at $1,000, gradually increasing in price as you bump up the specs. However, there are a few we‚Äôd recommend that often come in below the $1,000 mark, either thanks to slightly lower starting prices or frequent sales. We‚Äôve included a ‚Äúbudget‚Äù pick in this guide, but just know that ‚Äúbudget‚Äù in this case doesn‚Äôt mean cheap; it means relatively affordable.</p><p>One other thing that‚Äôs important to consider is battery life. Manufacturers have gotten better at eking out more juice from their devices. We recommend buying one rated for at least eight to 10 hours.</p><p>You can take all of that advice and wade through the plethora of product pages on the Internet to find the best ultraportable laptop for you. But if you don‚Äôt have that kind of time or patience, we‚Äôve compiled a list of the devices that we consider to be the best options available right now.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best overall: Dell XPS 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/de59cfe0-eb8f-11ea-87ff-661ce183e954" alt="Dell XPS 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Dell didn‚Äôt overhaul the XPS 13 for 2021, because why fix what isn‚Äôt broken? Instead, the company brought in more optional add-ons so customers could make its flagship laptop as personalized as possible ‚Äî as long as they have the cash to do so.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ">XPS 13</a> has been one of our favorite laptops for years thanks to its slim, attractive design, powerful performance and solid battery life. In 2020, we saw Dell remove the excessive chin bezel below the screen, letting the 13.4-inch display extend from corner to corner. It now has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is better than before but not quite as good as a 3:2 ratio. We prefer taller screens because they reduce the amount of scrolling necessary to browse web pages and review documents comfortably. The XPS 13‚Äôs display continues to support HDR and Dolby Vision, so you‚Äôll get top-notch video quality whenever you stream. New for 2021 is the optional 3,456 x 2,160 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">OLED display</a>, which you can add to the XPS 13 for about $300 extra.</p><p>The XPS 13 remains just as thin and light as it has been for the past couple of years. It weighs only 2.64 pounds and measures just over a half-inch thick at its widest point. We also like its spacious trackpad and comfortable, scissor-switch keyboard. It may not be the flashiest ultraportable on our list, but honestly we kinda dig the XPS‚Äô subtle design. It looks and feels like a flagship device, but it never feels ostentatious.</p><p>Those set on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ">XPS 13</a> in 2021 will find Tiger Lake processors powering the laptop, and the option to trick it out with up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Notably, the base model includes 8GB of RAM much better than the 4GB minimum on past models. Four gigs is rarely enough for a daily driver (unless you‚Äôre looking at a Chromebook), and it‚Äôs reassuring to see Dell finally came around on that. If you‚Äôre going to upgrade anything when ordering directly from Dell, we recommend springing for the Core i5 processor instead of sticking with the base Core i3.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ" id="6c050c723c0643e3a7ab389006e1df0f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Dell;elmt:viglink;pdid:">Buy Dell XPS 13 starting at $999</a><h3>Best for Apple fans: MacBook Air M1</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="Apple MacBook Air M1" data-uuid="720a9600-0957-3d5e-9036-031264cc2d04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple continues to make the  MacBook Air a compelling option for most people thanks to the M1 chipset in the latest model. And that‚Äôs really the star of the show here ‚Äî the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3mACQCj">MacBook Air M1</a> is blazing fast, running native apps like Safari and GarageBand without breaking a sweat. The laptop wakes almost instantly when you open its lid, sites load swiftly and scrolling is seamless. And because M1 is ARM-based, you‚Äôll be able to run iOS apps on the Air, too.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> looks familiar on the outside, a big  difference under the hood is that there‚Äôs no fan. Although you sacrifice a bit in the way of heat management, it means the laptop runs more quietly than before. And just because its appearance hasn‚Äôt changed, doesn‚Äôt mean it looks dated. It still has an attractive 2.8-pound unibody enclosure, a gorgeous 13.3-inch Retina Display, a TouchID fingerprint sensor and a comfortable keyboard with springy buttons (no problematic butterfly keys to be found here).</p><p>Along with the M1 processor, the latest MacBook Air comes most readily with 8GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. If you order directly from Apple, you can increase the RAM to 16GB and get as much as 2TB of internal storage. A fully specced-out model will set you back $1,800, but most people will find that their needs are met by the 256GB base model.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mACQCj" id="c3a0b1c1c7334ed3b86bd9a9a6baedc2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon starting at $999</a><h3>Best convertible: HP Spectre x360 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/3f00be20-eb91-11ea-97fe-6ce20995fd32" alt="HP Spectre x360 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Spectre x360 13" href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm">Spectre x360 13</a> is the culmination of years of improvements on HP‚Äôs part. It combines most of the things we‚Äôd want in a laptop, including a versatile convertible design. Old-school 2-in-1s had a tendency to be wobbly and unstable, but this is anything but. Its metallic hinges provide a sturdy structure for the machine when in laptop mode and spin smoothly whenever you need to work in tent or tablet mode.</p><p>The model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-27-hp-spectre-x360-13-inch-review.html">we reviewed</a> in 2019 had a 1080p touchscreen, but HP gives you the option to outfit the Spectre x360 13 with a 4K AMOLED panel ‚Äî a good choice for creatives and streaming aficionados (just be prepared for shorter battery life). By no means is a 4K display necessary on a 13-inch machine, but companies have been adding them as options on flagships to satisfy all the display nerds out there. Regardless of the screen you choose, the laptop‚Äôs 90-percent screen-to-body ratio will provide an immersive experience when you‚Äôre watching movies on Netflix. The keyboard is also quite comfortable and we particularly like that HP made the buttons as large as possible, stretching them all the way to the edges of the chassis.</p><p>In addition, HP included an IR camera for Windows Hello, a Precision touchpad and a few more ports than you‚Äôd expect to see on an ultraportable of this size. Its edges hold two USB-C ports for charging and data, a USB-A port and a microSD slot. The machine‚Äôs 14.5-hour battery life makes it even more versatile, as it lasts an entire work or school day with juice left to spare.</p><p>The worst thing we can say about the Spectre x360 13 is that its webcam produces grainy video and HP includes a bit more bloatware than other OEMs. Also, the machine&#39;s jewelry-like design may not be to some shoppers‚Äô tastes, but it‚Äôs not garish enough for us to knock it either. It also helps that the <a href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm">base model</a> now includes an 11th-gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an FHD touchscreen for just over $1,000. What‚Äôs more, HP is one of the few companies to include a stylus with its flagship convertible at no extra cost, meaning you can use it as a digital notebook straight out of the box.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm" id="d0d44523f8634371804279e44ad6afa0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Spectre x360 13 at HP starting at $1,109</a><h3>Best budget option: HP Pavilion Aero 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" style="height:1191;width:1852;" alt="HP Pavilion Aero" data-uuid="c1611205-6a79-39ad-9a0d-3582355eff83"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>In order to appeal to Gen-Z users, HP made its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pavilion Aero 13" href="https://fave.co/3yjQsnQ">Pavilion Aero 13</a> laptop as thin and light as possible while keeping it at a relatively affordable price. Starting at $749, the laptop weighs only 2.2 pounds and takes some design notes from the company&#39;s Spectre and Elitebook lines. That makes it a pretty attractive machine, and that&#39;s not something we take for granted at this price range.</p><p>While its keyboard is not backlit by default, it is comfortable to type on even if the layout is slightly more cramped than usual thanks to the page up/down key column on the right side. You also get a big trackpad and a 13.3-inch 1,920 x 1,200 display on the base model, plus the option to upgrade to a 2,560 x 1,600 display if you like. We also appreciate the port variety on this machine: two USB-A ports, one HDMI connector, one USB-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack. HP has generally done a good job keeping as many connectors as possible on even its flagship laptops, and it&#39;s nice to see that its budget notebooks received the same treatment.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html">reviewed</a> the top-tier model that costs $999, but the base model isn&#39;t anything to scoff at. It includes a Ryzen 5 5600U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is impressive when you consider other flagship laptops with similar RAM and storage amounts cost $250 more to start. While it does force some sacrifices, the Pavilion Aero 13 is not one to overlook if you want a good value laptop.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3yjQsnQ" id="d5b890711e104fab824bddde6c48ace8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Pavilion Aero 13 at HP starting at $749</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630591824</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T14:10:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Dell]]></category><category><![CDATA[MacBookAir]]></category><category><![CDATA[ultraportables]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[xps13]]></category><category><![CDATA[spectrex36013]]></category><category><![CDATA[HP]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[zenbook13]]></category><category><![CDATA[laptops]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asus]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/60f2f830-eb92-11ea-8f37-98e1e97338a8" width="1600" height="1038" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/60f2f830-eb92-11ea-8f37-98e1e97338a8" width="1600" height="1038" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP Spectre x360 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Spectre x360 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony will hold a PlayStation showcase on September 9th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s finally ready to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"><ins>show off</ins></a> more of what it&#39;s working on for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ps5"><ins>PS5</ins></a> for this holiday season and beyond.

As <em>Fortune</em><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/02/in-boost-for-net-neutrality-top-eu-court-plunges-dagger-into-controversial-zero-rating-practice/">reports</a>, the EU&#39;s Court of Justice <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-09/cp210145en.pdf">has ruled</a> that zero-rating (aka &quot;zero tariff&quot;) options violate net neutrality and are &quot;incompatible with EU law.&quot; These perks don&#39;t honor EU regulations demanding that providers treat traffic equally, the court said.</p><p>The decision came after two German courts asked the Court of Justice about the legality of zero-rated options from carriers Telekom Deutschland (with a large stake in T-Mobile in the US) and Vodafone. The former offers a &quot;Stream On&quot; option that doesn&#39;t count music or video streaming from partner services toward your cap. Vodafone, meanwhile, offers passes (such as &quot;Video Pass&quot; and &quot;Music Pass&quot;) that waives data use for partners in different app categories, but only in Germany on your phone ‚Äî travel or use hotspot tethering and that benefit disappears.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Critics have attacked zero-rating as an attempt to stifle competition or arbitrarily boost revenue through partner deals and pricier service bundles. Providers can use these exclusions to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-blames-net-neutrality-for-hbo-max-hit-on-its-data-caps-095555622.html">promote their own media services</a> at the expense of rivals, for example, or force competing services to sign special agreements to avoid being hobbled. You might also be asked to pay more ‚Äî a carrier could ask you to subscribe to a pass just so you can watch TV shows without worrying about overage fees or throttling.</p><p>While the ruling touches on German ISPs, it sets a precedent that effectively bars zero-rating services across the EU. Local courts would only have to refer to the EU case. The question, of course, is whether non-EU countries will look to this as an example. The US has a pseudo-ban on zero-rating thanks to a California law, but the federal government hasn&#39;t yet followed suit after the Pai-era FCC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-03-the-fcc-stops-investigating-carriers-zero-rating-plans.html">shut down investigations</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eu-zero-rating-net-neutrality-ruling-132559309.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">71a5aa23-9730-461e-bd1d-61e8f6725887</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 13:25:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630589161</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T13:26:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fe3bd6b0-0bea-11ec-a47f-45de78b480e9" width="4724" height="3059" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fe3bd6b0-0bea-11ec-a47f-45de78b480e9" width="4724" height="3059" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thilo Schmuelgen / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logos of 5G technology and telecommunications company Vodafone are pictured at the 5G Mobility Lab of Vodafone in Aldenhoven, Germany, November 27, 2018.

The chipmaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-app-streamers-165218841.html">launched</a> the application for PCs equipped with RTX GPUs in 2020 to give people a way to make their livestreams look and feel more professional even if they&#39;re streaming from home. Up until now, though, it&#39;s only been focused on webcams. Now even streamers who use more specialized or expensive equipment will be able to take advantage of its AI-driven features.&nbsp;</p><p>Version 1.3 of the Broadcast app supports Canon&#39;s EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon&#39;s Webcam Utility and Sony&#39;s Webcam Utility, all of which are software tools that bring webcam-like function to the brands&#39; cameras. Perhaps more importantly, the update also gives the app support for OBS Virtual Camera, making it possible to use Broadcast with any video device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to expanding the app&#39;s hardware compatibility, version 1.3 also comes with an upgraded noise removal AI. The feature sometimes removes the host&#39;s voice when they&#39;re speaking loudly or at a higher pitch than usual, which isn&#39;t strange for streams where emotions can run high, such as in gaming streams. To address that, NVIDIA developed dedicated training sound profiles allowing the app to remove background noise without inadvertently muting the streamer.&nbsp;</p><p>The new app reduces VRAM usage by over 40 percent compared to its predecessor, as well, which could translate to an increase in FPS while gaming. NVIDIA added the ability to stack effects in version 1.2, but running several AI features for the mic, speakers and camera can eat up a lot of memory. This solves any issue streamers may have with their computers slowing down. To access Broadcast&#39;s new features and UI upgrades and to use it with professional cameras, users will have to download and install version 1.3 from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">company&#39;s website</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f2fc630-0be2-11ec-bdcf-ddffd13c6b44" style="height:529;width:1000;" alt="NVIDIA" data-uuid="dffcc634-2818-35d0-9af0-6d7dbafd420a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-app-supports-professional-cameras-130029164.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">283e0468-4b84-4eda-9217-848fee7b7e28</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 13:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630583107</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T11:45:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d81a96c0-0bda-11ec-b7ef-c512699f1fe5" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d81a96c0-0bda-11ec-b7ef-c512699f1fe5" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 drops down to $600 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s Mac Mini M1 is a good option for those eager to replace an aging desktop but also want to conserve space.

Designs haven&#39;t changed much across the board with Apple&#39;s latest computers, so the M1 chipset really is the star of the show. Using an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, it makes everything run more smoothly and quickly, and there&#39;s an additional 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks. The base Mac Mini M1 includes 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD, which should be just fine for most people, but keep in mind that neither RAM or storage are upgradeable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of the new stuff is inside the desktop, so the Mac Mini M1 will look very familiar to those that have used the machine before. It&#39;s a small box that will fit neatly in most desk setups, and it includes two Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A connectors, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>Even at its normal price, the Mac Mini M1 is the cheapest device you can get with Apple&#39;s latest chipset, making it a cost-efficient option if you&#39;re itching to get a new desktop. However, there are rumors that Apple could debut a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m-1-x-rumor-194549101.html">redesigned Mac Mini</a> soon. However, there&#39;s no guarantee we&#39;ll hear about that if and when Apple announces the latest iPhones later this month.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-drops-back-down-to-600-at-amazon-with-coupon-125314222.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca0ad199-f3d9-4889-9946-25a10c88efb4</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:53:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630591139</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T13:59:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JBL's fall lineup includes four new sets of wireless earbuds, starting at $80]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes trade show time, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBL" href="https://fave.co/2YfAe2t">JBL</a> typically debuts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-ces-2021-151556238.html">an entire truckload</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-airpod-alternative-220tws.html">new</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-club-series-headphones.html">products</a>. Although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ifa-has-been-cancelled-after-all-114810492.html">IFA isn&#39;t happening</a> in Berlin this year due to COVID-19, the company is still ready to show off all of the new audio gear that will arrive this fall. That list includes four new models of true wireless earbuds, two new portable speakers, a set of noise-cancelling headphones for kids and a wireless gaming headset.</p><h2>All of the true wireless earbuds</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a65b8730-0b9d-11ec-bdcb-559fd3a23f99" alt="JBL Endurance Race" data-uuid="63efa9af-c1e3-33fc-a748-473942b5a3f6"><figcaption>JBL Endurance Race</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Sitting atop <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBL&#39;s latest true wireless earbuds" href="https://fave.co/3mU2h1V">JBL&#39;s latest true wireless earbuds</a> list is the Reflect Flow Pro. This sporty model is rated IP68 waterproof with the company&#39;s Powerfin fit wings to help keep them in place during a run or workout. Active noise cancellation (ANC) can help you block out unwanted distractions while a Smart Ambient feature allows you to be aware of your surroundings with audio transparency.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>JBL promises &quot;perfect voice clarity&quot; on calls with the Reflect Flow Pro thanks to six microphones: two beamforming with a third for wind suppression on each side. Companies make lofty claims about voice performance all the time, so it will be interesting to see how close JBL actually gets to perfection. The Reflect Flow Pro will last up to eight hours on a charge with ANC on, with an additional two charges in the wireless charging case. You can also expect hands-free access to Google Assistant, customizable touch controls and compatibility with JBL&#39;s Headphones app. The Reflect Flow Pro will go on sale November 14th for $179.95 (‚Ç¨179).</p><p>For more affordable options, JBL is debuting follow-ups to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-ces-2021-151556238.html">Tune 125 TWS and Tune 225 TWS</a> earbuds. The new Tune 130NC and Tune 230NC have nearly identical spec sheets that include features like Pure Bass Sound, ANC, eight-hour battery life (ANC on), IPX4 water resistance, touch controls and a four-microphone array for calls. The differences are mostly in the designs: the Tune 230NC has an AirPods like stickbud look while the Tune 130NC is a more compact round shape. The latter also has larger 10mm drivers compared to the former&#39;s 5.8mm components. Both versions will arrive on October 17th and they&#39;re both $99.95 (‚Ç¨99).&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, JBL&#39;s fourth new true wireless model will only be available in the US. The Endurance Race joins the company&#39;s lineup of sport-themed Endurance products that include the Run, Sprint, Jump, Dive and Peak audio options. Like previous installments, the Endurance Race is IP67 waterproof, designed to mix durability with comfort to withstand workouts and weather. JBL&#39;s Pure Bass Sound is here as well, on top of 10-hour battery life, touch controls and ambient sound. There&#39;s no active noise cancellation or wireless charging here, but the price is affordable at $79.95. The Endurance Race is set to go on sale October 17th.</p><h2>JBL JR 460NC headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e02847f0-0b9d-11ec-bedf-e79c7b4a3514" alt="JBL JR 460NC" data-uuid="487cb77b-4f5c-3832-8592-c48275427cd8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Let&#39;s face it: most wireless headphones aren&#39;t designed to be used by kids. They&#39;re not nearly durable enough to withstand the constant drops and tosses into backpacks, plus you have to worry if your little ones are listening too loud. JBL says its new JR 460NC should address both of those concerns. The company&#39;s Safe Sound feature keeps volume under 85dB and the headphones are made with &quot;child-friendly, safe materials.&quot; ANC will help block out distractions for homework or travel, controls should be easy for kids to master and 20 hours of battery life ensures lots of use between charges. The JR 460NC is scheduled to arrive in the US this month for $79.95.</p><h2>JBL Flip 6 and Partybox 710 portable speakers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1de814d0-0b9e-11ec-bbbf-8096929c0b68" alt="JBL Flip 6" data-uuid="d609b72f-bfcd-33b1-aa92-3b6e30ec7be8"><figcaption>JBL Flip 6</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>For your portable speaker needs, JBL has two very different new options. First, the Flip 6 is a compact Bluetooth model designed for the outdoors with an IP67 dust and waterproof rating and 12 hours of battery life. The company says its dual passive radiator speaker configuration offers &quot;deep bass&quot; and &quot;stunning detail,&quot; thanks in part to a &quot;racetrack-shaped&quot; woofer and separate tweeter. The Flip 6 can also be used in PartyBoost mode where you can connect it to other compatible JBL speakers for more volume. This model will arrive in the US in December for $129.95 after debuting in Europe in November for ‚Ç¨139. Grey, teal, blue, black and &quot;squad&quot; color options will be available at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>The JBL PartyBox 710 is, as the name suggests, a single speaker large enough to power a whole dang party. This model joins the company&#39;s other options that are built for more than just casual listening. With 800 watts of power and an on-board light show, this quickly becomes an all-in-one entertainment machine. That&#39;s especially true when you factor in the guitar and microphone inputs. There&#39;s also Bluetooth and USB connectivity for music and one-touch stereo pairing with another PartyBox 710. The JBL PartyBox app allows you to control everything from tunes to the light show and more. Lastly, the massive speaker is IPX4 splashproof to evade accidental spill damage and its built-in handle and wheels help with transport. The 710 will debut in Europe in October for ‚Ç¨749 before arriving in the US in November for $799.95.&nbsp;</p><h2>JBL Quantum 350 wireless gaming headset</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59f66120-0b9e-11ec-b05d-7192b7dcecf0" alt="JBL Quantum 350" data-uuid="47c9d6d3-1f39-373e-816b-52fca94254a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re looking for a new wireless gaming headset, the JBL Quantum 350 checks a number of boxes. The headphones support &quot;gaming-grade&quot; lossless 2.4G wireless connectivity with a USB dongle, according to the company. JBL says 40mm drivers inside are powered by its QuantumSound Signature and QuantumSurround handles the immersive audio. The company&#39;s QuantumEngine PC software will enable you to customize the EQ, sidetone, mic settings and more. JBL promises comfort with a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads with up to 22 hours of battery life to keep you going well into the night. The company says the Quantum 350 is Discord certified and also compatible with both Skype and TeamSpeak. Most importantly, the headset goes on sale later this month for $99.95 (‚Ç¨119).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-fall-2021-123016677.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb1e9b2b-3de0-4fba-9402-bd7543826255</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:30:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630590948</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T13:56:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/71d16ef0-0b9b-11ec-bece-963b7d97e1be" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/71d16ef0-0b9b-11ec-bece-963b7d97e1be" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL Reflect Flow Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Reflect Flow Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Locast's local TV streaming service loses legal protections]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Locast, a company that claimed to improve access to local TV stations for people who can‚Äôt get the signal via traditional means, has been dealt a blow by a New York Court.

It added that the silicon is already small enough to fit in mobile hardware and that the promise of all of those extra pixels is to retain fidelity when pictures are cropped or resized.</p><p>Of course, these eye-catching figures don‚Äôt really mean a huge amount given that the HP1 will use pixel-binning just like every other overpowered image sensor. But arguably, the biggest innovation here is ChameleonCell, which can adjust the extent of the binning depending on the environment. For instance, in very low light, the camera bins down (by 16) to a 12.5-megapixel sensor, but promises images that are far brighter and clearer compared to its rivals.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/05e37340-0bd3-11ec-952b-2894d478dfd9" alt="Samsung" data-uuid="20ddc215-03d9-3e39-99af-93743165390d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>When shooting video in clear light, meanwhile, the system will divide by four, offering a 50-megapixel lens capable of shooting 8K videos at 30 frames per second. All of this averaging, Samsung says, will produce pictures and video that hold ‚Äúan astonishing amount of detail that helps the image stay sharp even when cropped or resized.‚Äù</p><p>Samples of the new silicon are available right now, and we would expect to see them popping up in mobile devices in the far-flung future. It&#39;s worth noting that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-exynos-2100-ces-2021-163139344.html">Samsung&#39;s Exynos 2100</a> already supports image sensors up to 200-megapixels, so while we wouldn&#39;t want to speculate that we&#39;ll see this in a future Galaxy flagship, we&#39;re also not <em>not</em> saying that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-hp1-200-megapixel-mobile-camera-sensor-100532406.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24ce096c-15bc-4388-ac63-b5337e3163c0</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 10:05:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630586216</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T12:36:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d4dca370-0bd2-11ec-abff-b512020bf451" width="720" height="404" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d4dca370-0bd2-11ec-abff-b512020bf451" width="720" height="404" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung ISOCELL HP1 Promotional Image]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Isocell HP1]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
