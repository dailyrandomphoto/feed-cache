No loose jewelry. Sign this waiver form. Don’t weigh more than 210 pounds. I was close to failing that last requirement after a year of pandemic and not much moving.</p><p>But I passed and after a brief series of elbow-bump greetings, I was soon being strapped into a hefty backpack that housed the main jet thruster and gasoline. Two engineers slipped two hefty jet outlets, also connected to the gear on my back, onto my wrists. It all felt heavy and I was now a little scared.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They guided me up onto the stage, and the crew, most of which pull double-duty as both test pilots and engineers, set up a stand to rest the arm jets on, before explaining how to control the jetpack. While the rear rocket seems tasked chiefly with getting your body off the ground, controlling the arm rockets —and keeping your own arms rigid — is what moves you, stabilizes you and generally stops you from spiraling out of control in front of a crowd of intrigued onlookers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dee0f7f0-e3ea-11eb-b5fb-1046f677210a" alt="Gravity Industries at the Festival of Speed 2021" data-uuid="b8f34fdd-9e87-36fa-a6f3-9c00d5c510be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>As part of BP’s <a href="https://www.goodwood.com/motorsport/festival-of-speed/explore-festival-of-speed/fos-future-lab/">Future Lab at the Goodwood Festival of Speed</a>, a long-running car show held in one of the leafier parts of southern England, Gravity Industries was showing off its latest jetpack to spectators and letting the occasional journalist and VIP, including Olympic athletes, influencers and musicians take to the air.. for a few seconds.</p><p>While we’ve written about Gravity Industries and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-taking-on-gravity-richard-browning-penguin-random-house-uk-153026035.html">its founder Richard Browning</a> a few times, covering world record attempts and other experiments. All of these demanded the same miniature jet engines Browning’s been refining for years. And gasoline.</p><p>Stood on stage, with the two arm jets resting on a frame in front of me, the team finishes teaching me the fundamentals of movement: Use your right-hand trigger to adjust thrust, spread uniformly across the three jets; raise your hands to go back, bring them behind you to go forward; raise just one to rotate in that direction. Someone tapped my back and I realized I was now attached to a safety wire that ran across the very top of the stage.</p><p>And that was it. An engineer put a pair of ear protectors on me — I had a big heavy engine on each wrist  — and withdrew to a safe distance. Then the engines kicked in, and I immediately realized why I had ear protectors.</p><p>These engines can roar. Collectively, they have enough power to lift up to 210 pounds, but the Gravity Industries team gently increased the engine power, meaning I could literally find my feet, moonhopping from side to side, feeling the effects of different angles on the arm thrusters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2b48470-e3df-11eb-bff9-45b0af645f88" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="a05af733-7210-35b8-b0af-d4ffd755f91b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>Keeping my arms straight not only kept these roaring engines away from me, but made it easy to stay rigid and adjust the shape of my body.  Finally, my brief dalliance with gymnastic rings was paying off. As the power was stepped up, Browning (who was apparently commentating on my efforts to a crowd of spectators — I couldn’t hear him) flagged me and I powered down the motors. I hadn’t quite got off the ground for more than a few seconds at a time. He explained that I could guide where I went by looking (and turning my head) in that direction, like how you control the direction of your snowboard. I followed his hand as he walked from one side of the stage to the other, and the jetsuit was doing what I wanted it to.</p><p>Gravity Industries’ jetsuit is designed so that intuition kicks in pretty soon. We naturally raise our hands when we fall. Feel like you’re falling here, and the same gesture will keep you upright. At the same time, intuition can also mess you up. With a powerful engine strapped to your back, pointing at the floor, you should not kick your legs back. Or flail them when you panic. The stream isn’t going to flambé your legs, but you’ll feel a wave of heat that doesn’t exactly help to calm you down.</p><p>After the flailing, I’d run out of fuel, and it was time for a refill. Once topped up, and with a little more confidence, I stepped onto the stage. The engineers cranked up the power a little bit more, and I tried to hold my nerve. The engines were roaring louder than ever, and I managed to, finally, lift myself off the stage. I turned, I wobbled, I moved backwards, forwards and landed when I felt like landing. Did I feel like I was six feet off the ground? Yes. Was it really only a foot and change? Yes.</p><div id="669d8398c7e0414db9f7313263df9f0e"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF;border:0;margin:1px;max-width:658px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;"><div style="padding:16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="background:#FFFFFF;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display:flex;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:40px;margin-right:14px;width:40px;"></div><div style="display:flex;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:100px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding:19% 0;"></div><div style="display:block;height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px;"></div><div style="padding-top:8px;"><div style="color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;"> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding:12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:14px;"><div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;margin-right:14px;margin-left:2px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:8px;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:20px;width:20px;"></div><div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:2px solid transparent;border-left:6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom:2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:auto;"><div style="width:0px;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right:8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12px;width:16px;"></div><div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left:8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:24px;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:224px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Mat Smith (@thtmtsmth)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Earlier this month, on Independence Day, Mark Zuckerberg published a video of him atop an electric surfboard — if not jetpack — holding the United States flag as he was propelled across the water’s surface. The very, very weird clip raises the question with a lot of these bleeding-edge transport concepts: are they simply play-things of the rich-and-famous?</p><p>Gravity Industries, as well as US rivals like <a href="https://jetpackaviation.com/">Jetpack Aviation</a> offer “experience days” for groups that include training with the jetsuit and a tour of the company’s research facilities.<a href="https://gravity.co/flight-experience"> These cost a few thousand dollars</a>. You can also register for dedicated flight training, which is even more money. Tapping into enthusiastic early adopters does offer the funding needed to evolve these projects, and fuel is expensive — so are these jetsuits. But beyond day trips for the rich and showing off the suit to Tom Cruise, what are they for?</p><p>The immediate example might be military uses. The military is often the first to adopt new technologies, willingly funding many innovations that have dripped down to civilian life. Browning mentions how helicopters once subverted military strategy when first introduced, with the ability to drop off fully-equipped soldiers into packed jungles changing the assumptions of modern warfare.</p><p>Jetpacks are, for now, noisy, fuel-hungry and vulnerable, however. But the posit is that they could offer an entirely different paradigm in warfare — one not yet imagined (or perhaps affordable) just yet.</p><div id="0ac7a6cb91f24181b78598f02e055d99"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suHOLFhbwsM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The British Royal Marines have already tested out Gravity Industries’ suit as an alternative to rappelling from helicopters. In the test, one soldier launched from a boat, landed on a larger vessel and lowered the ladder to the rest of his squadron, cutting out the need for a bigger helicopter.</p><p>It’s not all warfare, however. In a recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-ambulance-services-are-testing-jet-suit-paramedic-recoveries-124052727.html">experiment with the UK’s Great North Air Ambulance Service</a> (GNAAS), Browning flew to a simulated casualty in a mountainous area in just 90 seconds, far faster than the 25 minutes it took air ambulance medics to make it on foot. The time reduction could literally save lives, if a solution to the high-cost and learning curve can be found. The suit is also limited by how far it can fly before needing more fuel. It can typically run for around 5-10 minutes, depending on the pilot’s weight and other factors. Like drone deliveries, for now, jetsuits can only offer last-mile movement — and it has to be less than a mile.</p><p>Before the pandemic locked down travel pretty much everywhere, Gravity Industries was also mere weeks away from holding its first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzHWSqMdo1I">race event</a> in Bermuda. It would involve two racers flying around a circuit mixed with an obstacle course built over water, competing for the fastest time. It sounds like something out of <em>The Running Man</em>.</p><p>I’ve watched most of the clips of Gravity Industries’ YouTube channel, and Browning’s other appearances on TV shows. But seeing someone with skill put the jetsuit through its paces,  that’s when I got the appeal of someone flying around that <em>wasn’t</em> me.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d288b980-e3df-11eb-bdef-84cc44c36f05" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="804d19f9-8d60-3173-bcb4-822b3dbb331d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>He finishes addressing the crowd at Goodwood and drops his mic behind a couple of loudspeakers. He steps to the middle of the stage, no safety line, and blasts upwards about three feet. He glides off the stage to the grass between it and the crowd. He punches the thrust harder, going even higher, and takes a tour around the perimeter of the stage. Blades of grass fly around, the engines roaring so loud that it’s hard for the audience to choose between Instagramming this spectacle or plugging their ears with their fingers. He makes another loop, then gingerly lands, center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone around claps, passersby ask Gravity Industries staff if there’s any chance of them trying the jetsuit at the show. They’re politely told that the slots are fully booked, and nudged towards the test flight sessions they offer online.</p><p>At the event, Gravity Industries also revealed what could be the future of something that’s already a near-future concept: a prototype electric jetpack. It was a surprise, given that Future Lab is sponsored by BP, the multinational oil and gas company, or perhaps that’s exactly why there was a non-fossil fuel project to show off.</p><p>This bigger model, with rougher edges, is more prototype than the gasoline models. Following the reveal, Richard Browning tells me that it was really to prove that “we can get someone off the ground.”</p><p>The challenges of an electric jetpack make gasoline versions seem easy. Gravity Industries’ electric proof-of-concept weighs twice that of the fuel iteration, yet it can only last for 10 to 15 seconds of “getting one of the lightest team members off the ground,” notes Browning.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5e6a62d9f5e24cd0a25695d92ba57db2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack"></section><p>The big challenge is the same faced by electric cars, or even smartphones: the limits of lithium batteries. Fortunately, this small company isn’t the only one chasing smaller, lighter, more potent batteries. With electric vehicles now mainstream, the progress in high-capacity batteries will almost certainly continue, if not accelerate.</p><p>There’s the design of the electric jetsuit itself, with almost oversized arm funnels in comparison to the gasoline originals. Browning explains that the electric version is effectively “blowing with fans” and so to get the thrust necessary, you need more air expelled and bigger fans to do so.</p><p>Browning explains that with fuel-powered engines, you benefit from explosively expanding gases — it’s easier to get the thrust needed. With electrics, you have to make all of that thrust yourself. “The bigger the fan you get, the less power needed.” It’s why helicopters have those huge rotor blades. “The smaller you make it, the more work it needs to do and the less efficient it gets,” he added. Still, even at this early stage, an electric setup could work well for training future jetsuit pilots. First-timers like myself were attached to a safety wire above ourselves — this could also be a power tether. For now, though, it’s a glimpse at a possible future for jetpacks — one that doesn’t demand fossil fuels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2aac070-e3df-11eb-b95b-4cb102d09a89" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="5424ee21-3ab1-3b8d-96ea-866ff368d85a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>Gravity Industries’ jetsuits are exciting, whether you’re in one or watching someone pilot one. They’re also real, with several paths that could offer a more significant impact. It’s hard to tell which one though, which may be why, for now, the company is letting journalists flail in the air rather than signing deals with the US Army.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gravity-industries-jet-suit-test-impressions-future-lab-festival-of-speed-160009551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50b59790-8d29-4d90-bd42-c2a405fb8a9d</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626194548</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T16:42:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/ Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gravity Industries jetpack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Gravity Industries jetpack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bethesda PS5 exclusive 'Ghostwire: Tokyo' is delayed until early 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tango-gameworks-reveals-gameplay-for-its-supernatural-thriller-ghostwire-210140591.html"><em><ins>Ghostwire: Tokyo</ins></em></a>, the upcoming PlayStation 5 and PC game from Bethesda studio Tango Gameworks, has been delayed to early 2022.

Early models like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">the ID.4</a> have struggled with rough software that struggles to compete with rivals like the Tesla interface or Android Automotive. VW&#39;s development firm Cariad aims to fix that with updates that will include a unified infotainment system in 2023 and a &quot;brand new&quot; platform in 2025.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>New Auto will also introduce a more Tesla-like &quot;controlled&quot; battery supply chain, complete with a harmonized battery format and six European gigafactories by 2030. The first, in Skellefteå, Sweden, will be run by a partner (Northvolt) when it starts production in 2023. Another factory is due in Salzgitter, Germany by 2035.</p><p>The goal is a significant one for car brand on the scale of VW, which owns brands like Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda. However, there are questions as to whether or not those goals are ambitious enough to meet both VW&#39;s other targets as well as those of key countries and states. The company wants to stop selling combustion engine cars in Europe by 2035, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-uk-ban-petrol-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035.html">the UK</a>, Canada and US states <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html">like California</a> all plan to ban sales of those passenger vehicles by the same year. Smaller rivals like Volvo plan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-will-go-all-electric-by-2030-and-move-all-sales-online-091653396.html">go all-electric</a> by 2030. VW won&#39;t have much time to finish electrifying its lineup in some places, and it may seem slow in comparison to a few brands.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vw-ev-sales-2030-target-153212862.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b00e51d3-83b9-439a-927c-f087271902a6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 15:32:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626190335</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T15:32:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1fe4ac90-e3e8-11eb-bb79-8eb889f5b13d" width="5892" height="3929" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1fe4ac90-e3e8-11eb-bb79-8eb889f5b13d" width="5892" height="3929" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tramino via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Berlin, Germany - 14th April 2021: Electric car Volkswagen ID.4 on a street.

However, the disappearance of 3.5mm ports on mobile devices has left many players bereft of premium audio — Bluetooth earbuds don’t quite cut it when you need your audio synced perfectly. If you want a rock-solid connection your best bet is an RF dongle, which usually uses USB-A in a world steadily being overtaken by USB-C ports. Razer has finally stepped up with a mobile-first headset that can connect to your Switch, Android phone or thin-and-light laptop, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$100 Barracuda X" href="https://fave.co/3keldHa">$100 Barracuda X</a>.</p><p>The Barracuda X is far from the first headset geared toward Nintendo Switch players; we’re big fans of SteelSeries’ <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Arctis 1 Wireless" href="https://amzn.to/3hSEH1o">Arctis 1 Wireless</a> thanks to its comfort and superb audio quality, and have even included it in a few of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-gifts-for-graduates-150047802.html">gift guides</a>. It’s fair to say that this headset is the Barracuda’s primary competitor. Even the RF adapters look the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b66708f0-e340-11eb-955c-31787a3eebd2" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="b37cc66e-5fbd-3a5d-a0a7-3027ed3d0f6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>However, while the Arctis 1 Wireless maintains the standard look of the line (as it should — it’s a great design), the Barracuda is a change of pace for Razer. Instead of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Kraken line" href="https://fave.co/3AODgd2">Kraken brand’s</a> circular, grated look, the new headset resembles last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-opus-headphones-review-150005344.html">Opus headphones</a>, which got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-opus-x-headphones-anc-preorder-171015484.html">refresh</a> last month. It’s not totally identical, with different joints on the cups, and cloth ear padding instead of fake leather. Here in New York, it’s 90 degrees as of this writing, and I can report that I haven’t felt the need to take off the Barracuda even after wearing it for a few hours. It’s still a bit warm, and I definitely feel cooler when I take the headset off, but it’s bearable.</p><p>The Barracuda X also weighs a very scant 250 grams, one of the lightest headsets I’ve tested. (I think it might be lighter than its own packaging.) In direct comparison it feels about the same in hand as similar models from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Turtle Beach Recon Spark" href="https://amzn.to/3k9TcAq">Turtle Beach</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech G733" href="https://amzn.to/2ViusM4">Logitech</a>, but there’s a balance in the Barracuda’s plastic build that makes it feel more ethereal. It’s not something I would mind keeping on my head for several hours or throwing it in my backpack so I can game on the train. Which is precisely the point: You shouldn’t feel that carrying this thing around is a burden.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b67f72f0-e340-11eb-a7ff-774ee8f8438b" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="aa7f41ef-d07e-3019-96a1-67f15b89f77a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>While I wouldn’t go tossing this thing around casually in a rage, it does feel solidly built, capable of taking a few dings in your bag. I have mixed feelings about the detachable mic; being able to take it off means a more compact headset design, but it’s also another fiddly bit that I might lose. Then again, it’s unlikely you need voice functions while out and about. (Heck, the Switch console doesn’t even have real voice chat; it asks you to connect via the app on your phone.)</p><p>The Barracuda X excites me, mostly because of its USB-C compatibility. But that’s also where it falls short for me. The adapter is small, for sure, but it’s very wide. That means that if you happen to have a laptop with two USB-C ports next to each other like my 2017 MacBook, the Barracuda dongle will block the other completely. This is a hassle in my office setup, where I have an external monitor and USB hub connected on the other side. So while working I get to choose between the power cord and the headset. I’ve opted out of using the Barracuda with my laptop at all, preferring instead to listen to podcasts on my phone. However, that’s my unique situation, and on the go you might only need two ports: one for the headset and the other for power.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b712d950-e340-11eb-a7bb-bbf19f27fc87" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="15f4da74-8dc0-331a-b662-6ad9a5df2223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s exciting to see companies finally start to take mobile gaming seriously, and address the specific needs those gamers have.

The Volkswagen-owned company has <a href="https://media.electrifyamerica.com/en-us/releases/149">unveiled</a> a Boost Plan that aims to &quot;more than double&quot; Electrify America&#39;s charging infrastructure in the US and Canada by the end of 2025. When the plan is complete, there should be over 1,800 fast charging stations and 10,000 individual chargers — many of them 150kW or 350kW chargers to support newer EVs like the Porsche <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> and Hyundai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-striking-ioniq-5-delivers-long-range-and-brisk-performance-093212320.html">Ioniq 5</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c3dddab0-e3e3-11eb-9db5-d520d9bbc628" alt="Electrify America Boost Plan 2025 EV charger map" data-uuid="bd068e13-e8f1-30be-affc-258810e66124"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Electrify America</div></figure><p>The company didn&#39;t provide much detail for its expanded coverage, but the expansion will bring Electrify America to the Dakotas, Hawaii, West Virginia, Wyoming and Vermont for the first time, not to mention the Canadian prairies and Maritimes. There&#39;s also denser coverage in a few southern states (including new cities like Austin) as well as upgrades to densely-packed regions. If all goes well, you&#39;ll have more cross-country routes in addition to more capacity along existing routes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expansion could put pressure on Tesla for the first time in a while. The company had 1,101 Superchargers in North America as of February 2021. While that number is likely to grow significantly by 2025, it now needs to build aggressively if it&#39;s going to stay ahead of Electrify America. Not that prospective EV owners will mind. The competition should go a long way toward making EVs more practical, particularly for drivers who can&#39;t always charge at home.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/electrify-america-boost-plan-ev-network-141651830.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c74d26bd-d6c0-4551-8f32-40855eec729a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 14:16:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626185817</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T14:17:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f4e79f70-e3dd-11eb-9e7f-676a742727ed" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f4e79f70-e3dd-11eb-9e7f-676a742727ed" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Electrify America]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5 at an Electrify America EV charger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5 at an Electrify America EV charger]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Omaze is giving away two seats on a Virgin Galactic spaceflight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the heels of Virgin Galactic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">completing</a> its first fully crewed spaceflight, Omaze launched a sweepstakes that offers the chance for anyone to win a spot on one of its first trips to space.

And Google&#39;s Motion Sense gesture feature never really panned out — it&#39;s a nice bonus, but not something you&#39;ll likely use on a daily basis.</p><p>In return, though, this might be a better value than the current Pixel 4a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">and 5</a> models, especially with the premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">Pixel 6</a> series likely on the horizon. You&#39;re getting a reasonably quick device with a smooth display and still-great cameras for as much or less than slower, typically less capable phones. So long as you can live with the quirks, it might deliver a better overall experience.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-amazon-bh-131509963.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b9ca42b-60e9-49e3-bf42-57d18e716918</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:15:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626182059</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T13:14:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/a2806360-7cfb-11ea-9ef5-1ddc5e7e29f2" width="2000" height="1335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/a2806360-7cfb-11ea-9ef5-1ddc5e7e29f2" width="2000" height="1335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazfit's latest earbuds can prod you to fix your posture]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Health-focused brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazfit">Amazfit</a> has revealed its latest earbuds, the PowerBuds Pro. They&#39;re true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation (ANC) up to 40dB and several health monitoring features, building on the original PowerBuds&#39; heart rate monitoring.</p><p>According to the company, PowerBuds Pro can use an accelerometer to detect the sitting angle of your cervical spine. If your neck has been in the same position for too long, the earbuds can nudge you to make an adjustment and improve your posture. In addition, Amazfit says the buds can detect when you start running and automatically start tracking your run time, speed, distance, calories burned and more. You can sync heart rate data with fitness apps such as RunKeeper and MapMyRun.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few ANC profiles that you can select depending on your surroundings. Indoor mode is centered around eliminating souls like typing, air conditioning and background chatter. In outdoor mode, you&#39;ll still hear announcements, Amazfit claims, but the ANC tech will stamp out trembling engines. There&#39;s also a workout mode, which blocks noises like wind but still lets you hear traffic for safety. The adaptive mode, meanwhile, will adjust the ANC based on your environment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0b4410e0-e0d8-11eb-b177-84b2e184840f" alt="Amazfit PowerBuds Pro" data-uuid="3e139108-c539-3112-b1a6-421ed00e3c9d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazfit</div></figure><p>The earbuds each have three microphones and AI noise-reduction with the aim of helping you have clear phone call quality. PowerBuds Pro will run for up to nine hours on a single charge, according to Amazfit, and the charging case can extend the lifespan to 30 hours.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazfit-bip-s-review-133036996.html">We found</a> the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$70 Bip S" href="https://amzn.to/2VxgJRD">$70 Bip S</a> to be a decent, inexpensive running watch.

Activision&#39;s latest offering for the <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> crowd is an objective-based mode called Payload. In a first for the game, the  mission will be added to the rotating playlists as part of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/07/season-four-reloaded-announcement-black-ops-cold-war-warzone#Payload">Season Four Reloaded</a>.</p><p>Here&#39;s what you can expect from the new mode when it goes live with the update at 12AM ET on Thursday, July 15th. Payload splits players in two teams of 20 that are tasked with either escorting or attacking vehicles transporting satellite parts. Each team must complete their objective within the designated time limit. As usual, you can use custom loadouts or killstreaks (including a new sentry gun from <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>) to help your side clinch victory. You&#39;ll also be able to buy and build obstacles to stall the vehicles on the tracks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The setup doesn&#39;t seem all that different from the types of protect or destroy missions available in Rockstar&#39;s <em>GTA Online</em> and <em>Read Dead Online</em>. Though, fighting off parachuting assailants or bombarding heavily armed trucks through multiple checkpoints does sound more frenzied. For its part, Activision is pitching Payload as a crucial battle that &quot;can shift the balance of the war between Perseus and NATO.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>As for file sizes, the <em>Warzone </em>update will range from 8.9GB to 9.2GB on PlayStation and Xbox and PC, respectively.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-warzone-payload-update-124922319.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b037a103-e0ce-46b7-b6ed-72dc87fc6928</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 12:49:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626180566</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T12:49:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/efc921c0-e3d4-11eb-bbbb-fec23b71b516" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/efc921c0-e3d4-11eb-bbbb-fec23b71b516" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android 12 will let you play games while they download]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Faster internet and mobile data speeds are cutting wait times for game and entertainment downloads. The two art forms helped people through lockdowns, so it makes sense for tech and media gatekeepers to maintain that momentum as life slowly returns to normal. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-partial-downloads-launch-android-130054347.html">Netflix</a> did just that by allowing subscribers to watch partially downloaded shows and movies. Now, Google is <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/updates-from-google-for-games-developer.html">doing the same</a> for mobile games. The latest version of Android will allow you to fire up a game long before it completes downloading.</p><p>According to Google, you&#39;ll eventually be able to start playing Play store titles in seconds. More specifically, it says that games will be ready to open at least two times faster than before. One example shows a 127mb game being fit to play with just 20 percent downloaded. For now, developers can sign up to a beta for the feature, but Google says it will eventually become the default system for Play Store games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech giant has tried to tear down some of the barriers around digital gaming in the past. Notably, it launched<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-19-google-play-instant-games-demo.html"> Instant Games</a> in 2018 that loaded up ahead of the full installation process. While its Apple Arcade rival, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-google-play-pass-37-apps.html">Play Pass</a>, allows subscribers to try a library of apps for a monthly fee. Then there&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-173003693.html">Stadia</a>, Google&#39;s promising (but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-studios-closure-173055505.html">troubled</a>) cloud gaming service that does away with game downloads.</p><p>More broadly, the play-as-you-download feature comes at an opportune time. Like their console and PC brethren, mobile games are increasing in size. A trend players may have spotted with the release of open-world and metaverse games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/genshin-impact-sony-playstation-5-spring-170642072.html"><em>Genshin Impact </em></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Roblox"><em>Roblox</em></a> on iOS and Android. Research from <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/news/average-mobile-game-file-size-increased-76-over-last-five-years/">Sensor Tower</a> shows that the average file size of mobile games increased by 76 percent in the US since 2016. Helping players get to the action faster in the face of larger downloads is therefore a win-win for developers and the public alike.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-games-download-115553510.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">775f4fa9-6556-4f7f-b594-9204274f407d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:55:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626176703</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T11:45:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61c4cb60-e3cd-11eb-bfed-f504c16ce395" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61c4cb60-e3cd-11eb-bfed-f504c16ce395" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2020/10/04: In this photo illustration a Genshin Impact app by miHoYo Limited logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.

That includes the foldable Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy S21 FE, the Galaxy Watch 4,  Galaxy Watch 4 Classic smartwatches and the Galaxy Buds 2. The lineup suggests an aggressive push on its foldable devices, as Samsung remains the biggest phone maker dabbling in the new (still expensive) form factor. It’s still a key differentiator between the Galaxy family and pretty much every other phone series. This is especially true in the West, where foldables from Huawei, ZTE and Xiaomi and the rest don’t garner the same attention (or ad spend) as the Galaxy Fold.</p><p>Will Samsung offer a more competitively priced foldable? We don’t know just yet. The leaks share no prices and no launch dates, so Samsung will have something to reveal when Unpacked kicks off, which will, presumably, be very soon.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cryptofarm-ps-4-pro-raided-ukraine-045118233.html"><br>Cryptofarm with thousands of PS4 Pros raided in Ukraine</a></h2><h3>Caught because it stole electricity from the nation&#39;s grid.</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9dded1f0-e395-11eb-a3fe-b61df0dcd37a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, has discovered and raided a cryptocurrency mining farm that allegedly stole electricity from the country&#39;s power grid.

Hit the 100 percent mark and Mario will leap to the top of a flagpole, just like some of the games. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/its-a-me-mario-smartwatch-by-tag-heuer-connected-060037257.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-lspx-s3-glass-sound-speaker-bluetooth-portable-195849720.html">Sony made another lamp-style portable speaker</a></h2><h3>Orders for the $350 glass Bluetooth speaker will open in August.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-lspx-s3-glass-sound-speaker-bluetooth-portable-195849720.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3742f840-e340-11eb-bd57-7e81176d77c9" style="height:1688;width:3000;" alt="Sony LSPX-S3 glass sound speaker " data-uuid="8857543a-2081-32e8-a4ce-8229077651c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>Sony has revealed a cheaper model of its stylish speaker that looks like a lamp.

The flight aboard the New Shepard will take Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation pioneer Wally Funk and three other passengers to Kármán line, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">just beyond</a> the edge of space.&nbsp;</p><p>To get the certification, Blue Origin had to verify New Shepard&#39;s hardware and software operation during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepard-ns-15-test-flight-060356586.html">NS-15 test flight</a> conducted on April 14th, 2021. If all goes to plan, the New Shepard booster and capsule with astronauts aboard will blast off to an altitude beyond 100 kilometers (62 miles).

The prices for the different systems are also vastly different: Virgin Galactic&#39;s customers pay $250,000 for a ticket to the edge of space, Blue Origin space tourists are expected to pay around $500,000 and SpaceX clients will pay $55 million for a 10-day mission to the ISS.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a seat to fly with Jeff Bezos on the maiden Blue Horizon flight sold at auction for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepherd-seat-auction-winner-182036391.html">$28 million</a> to a buyer expected to be named soon.

Upon their launch, the true wireless headphones cost $300, but more recently they&#39;ve sat at the sub-$160 range, even briefly dropping to $120. This latest deal marks an all-time low for Amazon and essentially cements their appeal.</p><p>If you missed them in 2019, the Elite 85h offer EQ and noise-cancellation presets within Jabra&#39;s Sound+ companion app that actually boost their audio profile. The headphones can automatically switch between these so-called &quot;Moments&quot; by analyzing noise to detect which location you&#39;re in. In addition, the software lets you choose between different voice assistants and helps you find your headphones if you lose them.</p><p>The Elite 85h also offer on-ear detection. When activated from the app, you can automatically answer calls or resume audio by putting them on. What&#39;s more, the headphones boast a heaving 36 hours of battery life with ANC on, topping Sony&#39;s 1000XM3 by six hours and Bose&#39;s QC35 II by an impressive 16 hours. Turn off noise-cancellation and you can up that to 41 hours between charges.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85h-headphones-deal-102504141.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66035ab1-ea24-46a3-ae6a-1266168845e6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 10:25:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626171860</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T10:24:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d990fb10-e3c2-11eb-a7fc-42679f4125b6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d990fb10-e3c2-11eb-a7fc-42679f4125b6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h headphones]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h headphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senate appoints former NSA official as head of US cybersecurity agency]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A former NSA and White House official has been appointed to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at a time when ransomware and other kinds of cyberattacks are on the rise.

Samsung is trying to attack that market with a specially-designed automotive sensor that uses some unique technology to adapt to both low and bright lighting situations, the company <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-its-first-isocell-image-sensor-tailored-for-automotive-applications">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A touch smaller than sensors used on smartphones, the ISOCELL Auto 4AC offers 1,280 x 960 resolution but has a unique &quot;CornerPixel&quot; arrangement.

Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-12-sonys-hdr-camera-helps-self-driving-cars-see-in-the-dark.html">Sony&#39;s HDR automotive sensor</a>, it can capture video at night while also adapting to fast-changing lighting situations like in tunnels.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1906ec20-e3b2-11eb-bb7e-aa32d89ef919" alt="Samsung&#39;s latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications" data-uuid="d7390c72-8665-33a7-a809-c367235826b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>&quot;With two photodiodes capturing images in different exposures simultaneously, the sensor offers up to 120dB HDR with minimal motion blur, allowing smoother transitions between dark and bright areas while preserving more details of the road ahead,&quot; according to Samsung. At the same time, it can mitigate flicker issues with LED lights over 90 hertz used in headlights, street lamps and other sources.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung is rumored to have won a $436 million dollar contract to supply &quot;the largest US EV maker&quot; with camera modules that would replace rearview mirrors, according to the <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107120014"><em>Korea Economic Daily</em></a>. That automaker is rumored to be Tesla and the vehicle may be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">Cybertruck</a>, which has cameras in the front fenders rather than rearview mirrors, as <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/12/tesla-cybertruck-rumored-behind-camera-deal-samsung/"><em>Electrek</em></a> has noted. All that said, however, the new sensor launch may be unrelated and for now, cameras still can&#39;t legally replace side mirrors in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other automotive-grade sensors, the ISOCELL Auto 4AC can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 to 125 degrees Celcius, and can be adapted to both human (mirrors, backup cameras etc.) and machine (self-driving) systems. The sensor is currently in production so it could appear in cars in the near future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-hdr-camera-chip-automotive-applications-082447761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee159c06-270e-4f74-9083-8e62b016c6af</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 08:24:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626165423</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T08:37:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fdd91560-e3aa-11eb-9fef-ca5daa805894" width="1000" height="617" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fdd91560-e3aa-11eb-9fef-ca5daa805894" width="1000" height="617" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung's latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung's latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tag Heuer made a Super Mario-themed smartwatch because why not]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your favorite video game plumber will soon be available on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS watch</a>. Tag Heuer announced today that it&#39;s collaborating with Nintendo to make a <em>Super Mario</em> edition of its Connected smartwatch, featuring &quot;the intrepid, iconic hero&quot; in various watch faces and animations. It&#39;ll be available July 15th for $2,150, which is in line with how much the Connected series has cost in the past. One of the highlights here, though, is the company&#39;s use of Mario&#39;s appearances to encourage wearers to get active and reward them when they move.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tag Heuer, Mario&#39;s &quot;upbeat and active personality will encourage wearers of this smartwatch to enjoy moving too.&quot; But it&#39;s not just about being inspired by simply seeing his face on your wrist. The watch&#39;s dial will become &quot;livelier and more animated the more the wearer is active.&quot; There&#39;s also a &quot;gamification rewards system&quot; at play. Mario will greet you with a salute each morning, and as you move about, you&#39;ll get different animations as you hit 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent of your steps target. These animations feature familiar items from the Mario universe, like the Super Mushroom, Pipe, Super Star and Goal Pole. The company says this idea was inspired by the notion of &quot;easter eggs,&quot; so I suppose you&#39;re supposed to treat these animations as such.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even when you&#39;re not being active, the Tag Heuer Connected Super Mario edition&#39;s interface will remind you of the character. You can choose from a selection of four new watch faces, and they don&#39;t just offer red-and-blue themes. The Timekeeping dial, for example, uses &quot;retro elements from the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. with Mario, all in pixels.&quot; One of the designs features Mario&#39;s cap, while another takes elements of the game and puts them in a rotating animation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cbe5a4a0-e347-11eb-9fef-3e317055ea60" alt="Five of the Tag Heuer Connected Limited Edition Super Mario watches with black-and-red straps.

Push buttons, crown logo and bezel graduation now come in Super Mario red, and you&#39;ll find symbols etched into the bezel that reflect the in-game objects you&#39;ll see when you hit your steps goals, too. A letter M is engraved on strap buckles and the crown, while the words &quot;TAG Heuer x Super Mario Limited Edition&quot; are also carved into the back of the watch. The company is also offering two interchangeable straps for the new watch: a black leather band on red rubber and a &quot;sporty alternative in matching red perforated rubber,&quot; as well as a travel case in — what else — Super Mario red.</p><p>Those hardware touches are pretty important since even though the Mario faces and skins will be available first on this limited edition of the Connected watch, Tag Heuer said it &quot;is also considering making it available on other editions of TAG Heuer Connected at a later stage.&quot;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="96716338-6e4f-463a-a8a2-cb38bbb5f085"/><p>Since this is a Wear OS device (Tag Heuer hasn&#39;t responded to Engadget&#39;s query on whether this is the existing OS or if it will update to the version co-engineered by Samsung and Google), the rest of the watch&#39;s functions will feel familiar. You can access Google Assistant, get your calendar and weather updates, along with Fit progress tracking on the watch.

But instead of finding computers, the agency found racks with thousands of PS4 Pros stacked vertically side-by-side. As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/thousands-of-ps4-pros-discovered-in-warehouse-raid-1847272415"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, the Ukrainian authorities confiscated over 5,000 gaming-related devices — 3,800 of which were consoles — from a warehouse right next to (and formerly owned by) the Vinnytsiaoblenergo energy distribution company.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s the largest cryptofarm the SBU has discovered so far, and the agency believes it&#39;s being operated by people living in the cities of Kyiv and Vinnytsia. Apparently, the operators used special electricity meters to prevent authorities from discovering the theft, which amounted to as much as US$257,000. &quot;At the same time,&quot; the SBU wrote in its announcement, &quot;the illegal withdrawal of electricity could lead to more global consequences — entire neighborhoods of Vinnytsia could be left without electricity.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vinnytsiaoblenergo denied any involvement in a statement sent to the <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/security-service-uncovers-crypto-mining-farm-in-vinnytsia-allegedly-stealing-electricity.html"><em>Kyiv Post</em></a>: &quot;The equipment used for cryptocurrency mining has never operated on premises owned by our enterprise.&quot; It also said that it didn&#39;t find any evidence of electric theft and that the SBU&#39;s findings &quot;does not correspond to reality.&quot; While it&#39;s unclear at the moment whether the facility truly stole electricity or not, the SBU has published images of the  PS4 Pros it found at the warehouse, which you can see below. As <em>Kotaku</em> notes, 3,800 consoles mean an investment of around US$1,500,000, assuming all of them are PS4 Pros.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9dded1f0-e395-11eb-a3fe-b61df0dcd37a" alt="CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v62), quality = 90

The retailer has discounted the laptop by $80, marking one of the first times we’ve seen it on sale since it came out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-2021-chromebook-lineup-134546625.html"><ins>earlier in the year</ins></a>. With the discount, the Spin 713 is currently $619 instead of $699. The model that Best Buy is selling features an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It also comes with plenty of ports, including two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 connections, a microSD slot, as well as HDMI and headphone jacks.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/doL5G3">Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $619</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget gave the Spin 713 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html"><ins>score of 85</ins></a> when we reviewed it last month. Part of what makes it stand out in the crowded Chrome OS market is that it features a display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Most Chromebooks feature 16:9 displays, making them well-suited for watching video content but less than ideal if you need to do any work on them. The display on the Spin 713 is also bright and sharp with a pixel density of 200 pixels per inch. The taller screen also means you get a more generous trackpad than you’ll find on your average Chromebook. Combine that with a solid keyboard, a capable processor and just the right amount of RAM for Chrome OS and you have a device that’s solid. Aside from average battery life, one of the few complaints we had with the Spin 713 was the asking price. At $619, it&#39;s a better value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-best-buy-deal-221524448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bea7f764-11f3-4e7c-a9a3-8f165d597ff2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 22:15:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626128127</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T22:15:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon settles with Huawei over patent disagreement]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Huawei and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) have settled their long-standing patent dispute. The disagreement dates back to 2019 when Huawei said it approached Verizon about licensing some of its technologies. After nearly a year of negotiations, talks between the two companies broke down on January 21st, 2020, and Huawei went on to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-huawei-verizon-patent-lawsuit.html">file multiple lawsuits against the telecom in courts across Texas</a>. At the center of the feud were 12 standards-relevant patents that Huawei said Verizon was using in its infrastructure. At the time, Verizon dismissed the lawsuits, claiming they were “nothing more than a PR stunt.”</p><p>It has since changed its tune. “Verizon is happy with the settlement reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits. While terms of the settlement are not being disclosed, our team did an outstanding job bringing this protracted matter to a close,” Verizon spokesperson Rich Young <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-statement-huawei-litigation-settlement"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Huawei, this is precisely the type of outcome the company had hoped for when it announced at the start of 2021 that it planned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-5g-patent-licensing-184450343.html">monetize its patent portfolio more aggressively</a>. While the US and other parts of the world have barred it from their national 5G networks, the Chinese company is ideally situated to make money on licensing fees. It has among the most 5G-related standards-relevant patents of any company in the world. To that end, it estimated the licensing strategy could help it generate as much as $1.3 billion in additional revenue between 2019 and the end of 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-verizon-patent-settlement-205915191.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fe42ff38-1e0a-4ec5-b905-69497069a867</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 20:59:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626123558</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T20:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/79281300-ca61-11eb-93d6-a1edda9f485c" width="5568" height="3132" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/79281300-ca61-11eb-93d6-a1edda9f485c" width="5568" height="3132" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HJBC via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boulogne-Billancourt, France - June 6, 2020: French headquarters of Huawei Technologies, chinese multinational company which designs, develops, and sells telecommunications equipment and smartphones.
