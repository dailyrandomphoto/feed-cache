Since then, the company has continued to refine its flagship product, all while defending itself from cheaper fly-by-night competitors. Our James Trew has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">reviewed the new GoPro Hero 10 Black</a>, which can shoot footage in 5.3K and take 23-megapixel stills from inside that notoriously sturdy housing.</p><p>We won’t spoil the bones of his review, but suffice to say the improvements in hardware and shooting technology are certainly welcome. Sadly, you might see a hit in battery life, but GoPro says customers aren’t trying to shoot theatrical movies on a single charge. If there’s one thing James really wasn’t a fan of, though, it was the price, which is $50 more than the last model, even if you subscribe to GoPro’s unlimited cloud backup service.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-collection-us-uk-october-130003972.html"><strong>IKEA&#39;s ASUS ROG gaming collection comes to the US and UK this October</strong></a></h2><h3>But beware the dangers of the gamer tax</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-collection-us-uk-october-130003972.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6ab2f7d0-17a1-11ec-bd71-cda6dc9d63a6" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="IKEA / ASUS" data-uuid="bbaebe76-080b-3a94-8f0f-c2e83338075f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA / ASUS</div></figure></a><p>IKEA and ASUS’ Republic of Gamers division teamed up last year to build more gamer-friendly furniture and gear.

As a result, the Wikimedia Foundation has banned seven editors from mainland China and removed administrator privileges from another 12, Wikimedia VP of Community Maggie Dennis wrote in a <a href="https://lists.wikimedia.org/hyperkitty/list/wikimedia-l@lists.wikimedia.org/message/6ANVSSZWOGH27OXAIN2XMJ2X7NWRVURF/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The foundation said it was fighting a situation called &quot;capture,&quot; in which a group gains control of Wikipedia edits to favor a viewpoint. It has been investigating the infiltration for nearly a year, and acted following &quot;credible threats&quot; to volunteer safety that &quot;led us to prioritize rapid response,&quot; Dennis wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Wikimedia was reportedly concerned that elections for powerful administrator roles were being manipulated. The infiltrators were reportedly editing articles to promote the &quot;aims of China,&quot; Dennis told the BBC.

It can show you at a glance exactly what you own and how much it&#39;s worth for &quot;fun, insurance or tax purposes,&quot; the company said. It also makes it faster to list an item you want to sell by simply pulling it from your collection.&nbsp;</p><div id="3059fe7f0b044c47af20093346683af0"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0O-2-9M3Dw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To use Collections, you go to your Reverb profile picture and hit &quot;<a href="https://reverb.com/my/collection">My Collection</a>,&quot; which will show everything you own and prompt you to add another item, either something you&#39;ve purchased from the site or a new item. Doing so brings up a search menu, which draws from a comprehensive database of musical gear to narrow it down to your exact item.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once you add an item, Reverb will show an estimate of its value, and if that&#39;s off (due to condition or whatever) you can enter your own estimate. Values are constantly updated with dynamic pricing, so you can follow how it&#39;s changed over time.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s a particularly useful feature for the many musicians who own a lot of gear and often shuffle their collections. It looks like the company has built up a very comprehensive database of guitars, synths, pedals and other gear, which could be a big help if you&#39;re trying to value your collection.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reverbs-latest-feature-lets-you-track-the-value-of-your-music-gear-084522694.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e475041e-08ab-47db-b456-c78368c20dd5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 08:45:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631867914</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T08:38:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/111cb920-178f-11ec-beff-2269ea9af963" width="2733" height="1687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/111cb920-178f-11ec-beff-2269ea9af963" width="2733" height="1687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Reverb]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reverb's latest feature lets you track the value of your music gear]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Reverb's latest feature lets you track the value of your music gear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telegram has seen a sharp rise in cybercriminal activities, report says]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cybercriminals have been using Telegram for years, because it&#39;s encrypted and easy to access. According to a recent investigation conducted by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc3e3854-5f76-4422-a970-9010c3bc732b"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> and cyber intelligence group Cyberint, though, there&#39;s been &quot;a 100 percent-plus rise in Telegram usage by cybercriminals&quot; recently. And <em>FT</em> says the rise in criminal activity on the app came after users flocked to it following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-facebook-data-sharing-205451955.html">change</a> in WhatsApp&#39;s privacy policy.</p><p>If you&#39;ll recall, WhatsApp asked its users to accept a revised policy allowing it to share data with its parent company Facebook earlier this year. Users were outraged, and WhatsApp had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-statement-encryption-surveillance-172224753.html">clarify</a> that it still won&#39;t be able to read their private communications. Even so, people migrated to rivals offering secure similar messaging capabilities — for Telegram, that has apparently led to a rise in criminal activity conducted through the app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the investigators, there&#39;s a ballooning network of hackers sharing and selling data leaks in channels with tens of thousands of subscribers. The number of times &quot;Email:pass&quot; and &quot;Combo&quot; were mentioned in the app over the past year reportedly rose fourfold. Some data dumps circulating on the app contain 300,000 to 600,000 email and password combinations for gaming and email services. Cybercriminals are also selling financial information, such as credit card numbers, passport copies and hacking tools through the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Tal Samra, cyber threat analyst at Cyberint, explained: &quot;Its encrypted messaging service is increasingly popular among threat actors conducting fraudulent activity and selling stolen data ... as it is more convenient to use than the dark web.&quot; In addition to being more convenient than the dark web, Telegram is also less likely to be monitored by authorities, Samra said.&nbsp;</p><p>Telegram has removed the channel where the massive datasets with email and password combos are being sold after <em>FT</em> notified the company. In a statement, Telegram also said that it “has a policy for removing personal data shared without consent&quot; and that it has an &quot;ever growing force of professional moderators&quot; removing 10,000 public communities every day for violating its TOS. Earlier this year, those moderators had to monitor hundreds of channels to keep an eye out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-us-calls-for-violence-230100510.html">for calls of violence</a> following the attack on the US Capitol.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/telegram-sharp-rise-cybercriminal-activities-072559131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a87096a-1fc1-4be0-9bc6-31ed1786994a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:25:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631862855</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T07:14:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/681fccd0-1780-11ec-bffb-29bcd45fae2f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/681fccd0-1780-11ec-bffb-29bcd45fae2f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olga Ihnatsyeva via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOGILEV, BELARUS-SEPTEMBER 18, 2019: Smartphone screen with icons of the social network Instagram, Skype, Telegram]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Smartphone screen with icons of the social network Instagram, Skype, Telegram]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Ken Block's Hoonigan team build a real life 'Halo' Warthog vehicle]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ken Block&#39;s Hoonigan Industries has built a fully functional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-02-02-real-life-halo-warthog-goes-for-a-test-drive.html">Warthog</a> vehicle, and the team is showing us the process it went through in a new series on YouTube.

To power the beast, the team took a Ford V8 engine and added two turbos to it, giving it a 1,060 horsepower capacity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Warthog appears across games in the <em>Halo</em> franchise as a driveable military vehicle, and the Hoonigan team built a replica of it to promote the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> game that&#39;s launching in December.

The company builds a bunch of useful tools for making the most of your electronic music setup, but its specially designed <a href="https://www.retrokits.com/shop/rk002/">MIDI cable</a> that adds features like velocity control to the Volca FM have proven quite popular. The latest member of its lineup though, is quite a bit more ambitious.</p><p>The RK-008 is a full fledged MIDI control center. It&#39;s an eight track MIDI sequencer and recorder, which allows it to be the glue that keeps your rig together. It also has a built-in metronome to help you stay in time with your instruments, which is important since all MIDI data is recorded unquantized. (Though you can quantize it after the fact, and then undo if you prefer to go back to your original sloppy playing.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="662eff2bdda24c2d87570aeb887441a1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjl4o9zIHj8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Each track can record on multiple channels, so you can actually control multiple devices from a single track, leaving the other seven open for... even more devices? You can even record eight parts across the eight tracks, then consolidate them down to one, freeing up more room for sequencing. And of course you can overdub or overwrite any performances.</p><p>Each of the tracks can be manipulated independently too. Allowing you to quantize them, add swing or transpose them. And it&#39;s all non-destructive, so you can easily undo your changes.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also a simple step sequencer built-in to the RK-008. It&#39;s probably not gonna work for complex chords, but does the job just fine it seems for four on the floor drums.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s two MIDI inputs and two MIDI outputs on the back, plus a separate dedicated sync port. Tracks can be assigned to one or both outputs, which is handy if you&#39;ve got that one drum machine that insists on having each instrument on a separate channel. The two in ports means you can merge MIDI from different sources, but also use different controllers for different instruments.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a feature list as is, and Retrokits says there&#39;s still more to be revealed, which is incredibly impressive for something that looks like pocket calculator from the 1980s — and I mean that as a good thing. The RK-008 looks part <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-one-retro-music-production-machine-142916111.html">MPC</a>, part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HP29C.jpg">HP calculator</a>, could probably fit in a pocket and yet seems capable of controlling an entire live music rig.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still some outstanding questions though, most importantly when it will come out and how much it will cost. But hopefully we&#39;ll find out sooner than later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/retrokits-rk-008-midi-sequencer-recorder-pocket-calculator-superbooth-232319863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">943a46ee-2f3f-4771-8b7e-c8ceb35c81d8</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 23:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631834161</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T23:16:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Retrokits]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian announces membership plan with complimentary charging and LTE connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With R1T trucks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">rolling off the assembly line</a> at its factory in Normal, Illinois, Rivian continues to prepare for the official debut of its first EVs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">later this month</a>.

He&#39;s best known for his namesake company&#39;s ZX computers, which thrived in the UK during the early 1980s — he succeeded in making home PCs accessible at a time when most models were still major expenses. A ZX Spectrum 16K, for instance, cost £125 where Apple launched the Apple II for $1,298 just a few years earlier.</p><p>Sinclair is also widely credited with having invented the first pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive, in 1972. Texas Instruments&#39; first programmable calculator (the HP-65) didn&#39;t arrive until 1974. He was an early pioneer of electric transportation, too, having developed the C5 electric tricycle in 1985.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like many inventors, his projects didn&#39;t always succeed. Sinclair&#39;s computer business ran into trouble in 1984 with the ill-fated QL, and he sold the company to Amstrad in 1985. And while the C5 may have been decades ahead of its time, that didn&#39;t translate to sales. Sinclairs&#39; vehicle business ran aground less than a year after the C5&#39;s debut.</p><p>Sinclair&#39;s legacy is clear, however. For many gamers and game developers, Sinclair&#39;s computers represented a watershed moment. McGill University <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/z/ZX_Spectrum.htm">noted</a> that many famous creators and studios, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-28-no-fable-creator-peter-molyneux-isnt-retiring-today.html">Peter Molyneux</a>, David Perry and Rare, cut their teeth on ZX Spectrums. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ti-bans-assembly-programs-on-calculators-002335088.html">Pocket calculators</a> are still useful even in the smartphone era. And it&#39;s safe to say EVs are here to stay, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-fxe-video-162013401.html">open-air rides</a>. There&#39;s a real chance Sinclar&#39;s work has affected the technology in your life, even if you&#39;ve never touched one of his products.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clive-sinclair-dead-obituary-212309487.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">866b1c96-0b42-49d0-86c1-0dba6becfa75</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 21:23:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631825424</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T02:38:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f47b0d0-1728-11ec-bddd-763fe74b1cd6" width="5873" height="3780" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f47b0d0-1728-11ec-bddd-763fe74b1cd6" width="5873" height="3780" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Levenson via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON - JANUARY 10: Sir Clive Sinclair launches his new electric vehicle the Sinclair C5, at Alexandra Palace, London on January 10, 1985.

He was one of the first to obtain the revised model and what he found after tearing down the console was that Sony had equipped it with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html">smaller and lighter heatsink</a>. In testing the unit, Evans found exhaust temperatures were higher than on the launch variant, leading him to claim it &quot;worse&quot; than its predecessor. That&#39;s a statement that led to controversy, and, in some cases, confusion over whether people should buy the updated CFI-1100 model.</p><div id="e6770106768941829959993a8de260a2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8-97fwkO78?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Now we have a more definitive answer on what the new heatsink means for the PlayStation 5. Working together, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-playstation-5-cfi-1100-review-better-or-worse-than-the-launch-console"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/VgWuGA8cExo"><em>Gamers Nexus</em></a> conducted an independent teardown and analysis of the console. The short answer of what they found is that &quot;in all practical terms, there is no meaningful difference between PS5s old and new.&quot; The longer answer is that the new PS5&#39;s cooling performance is more complicated than was first reported.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to featuring a new thermal assembly, Sony tweaked the motherboard and baseplate found in the refreshed PS5. The result of those changes is some components run cooler while others get hotter. However, <em>Digital Foundry</em> states, &quot;there is no evidence that this presents anything worth worrying about, assuming you are keeping your PS5 in a well-ventilated area.&quot;</p><p>Critically, the outlet found that once it installed the latest firmware from Sony, there was also no difference in performance between the new and old models. Both variants will pull as much power as they need to maintain a sufficient boost clock and throttle their fans to limit noise. Even as both consoles get hotter, you won&#39;t notice a dip in performance in the way you would with a PC GPU. Either way, should they hit a critical temperature where their components are in danger, both will automatically shut down to prevent damage.</p><div id="cbde2620e14c4dc79058b5137f865655"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jEccWyHUXYY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The core question of whether the new PS5 is better or worse than the launch model can be answered by saying that they&#39;re mostly much the same, certainly in terms of the end-user experience,&quot; according to <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p><p>The main takeaway from the analysis conducted by the outlets<em>&nbsp;</em>is that you can safely buy the updated model. You don&#39;t need to go out of your way to find the launch variant. In fact, it&#39;s probably best you avoid doing so since many scalpers have tried to take advantage of the fallout from the initial video Evans posted by selling their launch models for even more money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-cfi-1100-digital-foundry-analysis-204522648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34ec9751-168f-4b43-b62f-3cc226455c12</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:45:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631825126</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T20:45:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot is the latest developer to release its own game launcher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of game developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-rockstar-games-launcher-pc.html">releasing launchers</a> that feel redundant?

A court ordered the studio to compensate O&#39;Donnell financially but said he couldn&#39;t publish any music from <em>Destiny </em>without Bungie&#39;s blessing.

He also has to pay Bungie all the money he earned from selling tracks tied to the symphony on Bandcamp, in addition to compensating it for expenses it accrued during the contempt proceeding.

During a call with reporters, the company’s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the policy is necessary because bad actors are increasingly trying to “blur the lines” between authentic and inauthentic behavior.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We are seeing groups that pose a risk of significant social harm, that also engage in violations on our platform, but don&#39;t necessarily rise to the level for either of those where we’d enforce against for inauthenticity under CIB [coordinated inauthentic behavior] or under our dangerous organizations policy,” Gleicher said. “So this protocol is designed to capture these groups that are sort of in between spaces.”</p><p>Gleicher added that the new protocols could help Facebook address networks of accounts spreading anti-vaccine misinformation or groups trying to organize political violence. In announcing the change, Facebook said it took down a small network of accounts in Germany that were linked to the “Querdenken” movement, which has spread conspiracy theories about the country COVID-19 restrictions and has been “linked to off-platform violence.”</p><p>Facebook said it could take “a range of actions” in enforcing its new rules around coordinated social harm. That could include banning accounts — as it did with the “Querdenken” movement — or throttling their reach to prevent content from spreading as widely.</p><p>The issue of how to handle groups that break Facebook’s rules in a coordinated way has been a difficult one for the company, which up until now has primarily focused on taking down networks that rely on fake accounts to manipulate its platform. The issue came up earlier this year following the January 6th insurrection as Facebook investigated the “Stop the Steal” movement. According to an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html"><ins>internal report </ins></a>obtained by <em>BuzzFeed News</em>, Facebook employees suggested its existing policies weren’t equipped to handle “inherently harmful” coordination by legitimate accounts, which prevented it from realizing “Stop the Steal” was a “cohesive movement” until it was too late.</p><p>During a press call, Gleicher said that the “work on this policy started well before January 6th.” But he added that the company’s work against high-profile groups had informed their decision making. “If you think about our enforcement against QAnon-related actors, if you think about our enforcement against ‘Stop the Steal,’ if you think about our enforcement against other groups — we learned from all of them.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-social-harm-180601493.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a0098f4-4165-478e-a164-dd76101a4ce9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:06:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631815561</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T18:06:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen through two moving buses in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018.

The automaker has paired news of pre-production work with a <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/16/ford-begins-pre-production-f-150-lightning.html">promise</a> to invest an extra $250 million and create 450 new jobs to increase production capacity. That should help Ford build 80,000 Lightning trucks per year — little comfort when the company now has 150,000 reservations, but the move should reduce wait times.</p><p>Most of the jobs will go to workers assembling the electric F-150 at the Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, while others will build more batteries at the Rawsonville Components Plant and motors at the Van Dyke Electric Powertrain Center. The first trucks should be available in spring 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The production numbers won&#39;t compete with conventional trucks for a while.

However, it&#39;s still a recognition of pent-up demand for electric pickups, both from Ford and from the industry as a whole. Not that Ford might have much choice.

In fact, Roland and Boss have been at the forefront of guitar synths and MIDI controllers since the &#39;70s.  After launching the absolutely epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-boss-sy-1000-guitar-synth-effects-pedal.html">SY-1000</a> in 2019, then cramming a bunch of synth sounds into an actual guitar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boss-guitar-built-in-synth-and-bluetooth-pedal-control-080328921.html">Eurus</a> earlier this year, Boss is going a little more traditional with the SY-200.&nbsp;</p><p>The SY-200 isn&#39;t quite as big as the 1000, which is basically a pedalboard in and of itself. But it&#39;s definitely larger and more comprehensive than the compact Boss pedals you&#39;re probably familiar with, like the <a href="https://www.boss.info/us/products/sy-1/">SY-1</a> synth. The 200 has 171 different sounds spread across 12 different categories and can be played without the need for a special pickup.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1e1c52a141544debb42538c1bfcfdddb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8hQ1MEcTycY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Each voice has three parameters that you can customize, which pales in comparison to the full on programable synth inside the SY-1000, but it&#39;s definitely a lot more approachable and pedalboard-friendly. You&#39;ve everything from ripping leads, to warm pads, to delicate bell tones at your disposal. (Though, the Boss demo video above is real heavy on traditional guitar shredding.) Oh, and it&#39;s fully polyphonic, which we&#39;ve come to expect from Boss synth pedals, but it&#39;s still worth calling out.</p><p>There&#39;s two foot switches for giving you some control over live variation while playing, but you can also connect an expression pedal, or control parameters and program changes via MIDI. You&#39;ve got 128 preset slots for saving and recalling your favorite sounds. And last, but definitely not least, there are send and return jacks for blending in other effects in parallel with your synth sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The Boss SY-200 will be available for $300 in January alongside Boss&#39; new IR-based amp and cab simulator, the IR-200, which will retail for $400.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boss-sy-200-guitar-pedal-synth-superbooth-164427743.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02e1794f-9e7d-416e-9cc4-43e44610a799</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 16:44:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631815124</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T17:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44b7def0-170c-11ec-9bfe-353b748e8465" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44b7def0-170c-11ec-9bfe-353b748e8465" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Boss]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boss SY-200 synth pedal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boss SY-200 synth pedal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cadillac Lyriq EV reservations open on September 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cadillac is preparing to leap into the electric vehicle market with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-lyriq-luxury-ev-first-look-video-171543752.html"><ins>Lyriq</ins></a>, and now the automaker has revealed when you&#39;ll be able to lock in your reservation.

We meet again, Razer Huntsman. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-razer-huntsman-elite-hands-on.html">first opto-mechanical keyboard</a> was an interesting experiment, one I wasn’t too fond of thanks to its unpleasant key feel and noise. After three years (and a mini edition) later Razer is back with a new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Huntsman V2" href="https://fave.co/3kmDLVD">$200 version</a>, and it does seem the designers finally nailed it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/113aab70-165d-11ec-9f6c-e6f8d13b254c" alt="Keys on the Razer Huntsman v2" data-uuid="a956af94-9f3a-3432-a10f-403b4ffc29f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>First, a refresher: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/corsair-k100-gaming-keyboard-hands-on-130002628.html">opto-mechanical keys</a> have a small laser beam under each switch. When you press a key, it blocks the light path, sending a signal to the computer of what you just pressed. Because it doesn’t need to fully actuate (go up and down) on a physical level, it’s supposedly faster than traditional mechanical keyboards. In practice I didn’t really notice the difference and even now I can’t really distinguish the nanoseconds shaved off with each key press on the Huntsman V2.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1861c400-165e-11ec-a47f-2f15d2851388" alt="Red and purple key switches" data-uuid="7946b6e6-0663-3db7-98f2-2e7b80a46ab8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>However, what I can feel and hear is the layer of foam padding under the keys that mutes each stroke, which makes it a much more agreeable auditory experience — the first version had this annoying metallic echo that I could pick up even with my admittedly poor hearing. Granted, if you’re wearing a headset and listening to gunshots or music you probably won’t notice, but if you work in an office as I do, or share a small space with others, the comfort of those around you matters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8eab8de0-165d-11ec-9f3c-48ba0f08f31e" alt="Razer Huntsman v2 with wrist rest" data-uuid="62771dba-3136-31a0-a7f6-eceb43b7f893"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Now the keystrokes are still crisp but instead of hearing a metallic scratching sound it’s more a muffled thud. (You can choose clickier keys at checkout.) And the switches aren’t the only improvement Razer made toward comfort. There’s a larger, squishier wrist rest available at extra cost for those who like having one, which connects to the Huntsman v2 magnetically so you can easily pull it off when it gets in the way — the spacious rest adds another four inches to the 5.5-inch keyboard’s depth.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/deeb2470-165b-11ec-bfcf-5ba7a5216a60" alt="keyboard in black on a blue background" data-uuid="8282331f-cfac-3a58-a2e6-ea1970a6f5a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>However, if you find yourself really crunched for space, Razer is also releasing a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Huntsman TKL" href="https://fave.co/3hF5wqy">$150 tenkeyless version</a> of the Huntsman V2. Same opto-mechanical switches, but no number pad or media buttons on the right side. It’s similar in feel to the 60-percent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Huntsman Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3nCuWss">Huntsman Mini</a> I used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-60-percent-keyboards-160038272.html">earlier this year</a>, but the keys on the V2 feel slightly looser and require just a bit less effort to press. For most use cases the difference is negligible, but for people who take their gaming seriously, the effort you save — and the nanoseconds you shave off — matter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-huntsman-v2-keyboard-hands-on-150054626.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fff349af-f9cd-4fe5-a5f6-72ddf5f2daa8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 15:00:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631821543</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T19:45:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/24a34e80-165b-11ec-bf8c-04eb647f7ad9" width="1600" height="725" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/24a34e80-165b-11ec-bf8c-04eb647f7ad9" width="1600" height="725" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Black keyboard on a blue background]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Huntsman v2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AKG's $99 Ara USB microphone is built for streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll now have a better choice of microphones if you&#39;re eager to start livestreaming or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-the-best-podcasting-gear-for-beginners.html">record your first podcast</a>.

You won&#39;t have the Yeti Nano&#39;s software effects or flashier design (an important consideration as a streamer), but you&#39;ll also get a higher sampling rate than Blue&#39;s 48kHz offering.
