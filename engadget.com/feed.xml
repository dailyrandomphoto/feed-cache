A complaint mechanism would require online platforms to take these hostile posts down.

Adobe estimates combined Black Friday and Thanksgiving Day internet sales saw their first ever overall year-over-year decline in 2021, dipping from $9 billion in 2020 to $8.9 billion. That&#39;s not a calamitous drop, but Adobe saw it as a sign of shifting trends.</p><p>The tech firm believed the dip reflected a shift toward earlier shopping as buyers took advantage of internet deals starting as early as October. Why cram your shopping into a single day when you can take advantage of discounts weeks in advance? While Adobe expected more spending on Cyber Monday (between $10.2 billion to $11.3 billion), its data suggested the buying frenzy just wasn&#39;t as strong this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The products people were buying changed as the weekend progressed. Black Friday sales were dominated by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pots</a>, air fryers and toys, but Saturday sales were led by tech that included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">AirPods</a>, entry-level <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">iPads</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Meta Quest 2</a> and TVs from the likes of Samsung, TCL and Vizio. Game sales included <em>Just Dance 2022</em> and last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></a>.</p><p>Adobe also noticed that more people were comfortable making the final purchase from their phones. While some Black Friday shoppers were merely browsing on their phones before buying at a computer (62.2 percent of all visits were from handsets), mobile purchases represented 44.4 percent of all online Black Friday sales, a 10.6 percent jump versus 2020. Don&#39;t be surprised if many people never touch a computer for their holiday shopping in the years ahead.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-friday-sales-drop-adobe-151855092.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">67fa9f98-0314-4d26-a03a-6a466df05f20</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 28 Nov 2021 15:18:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638112737</ingested><modified>2021-11-28T15:19:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Banking & Budgeting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e7753b0-4bc7-11ec-b5be-b0806d858eb2" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e7753b0-4bc7-11ec-b5be-b0806d858eb2" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LEREXIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[photos showing an app for online shopping on Black Friday]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[mobile application for online shopping black friday]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Squeezed' light might produce breakthroughs in nano-sized electronics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s one thing to produce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-cd-sized-disc-095039455.html">nanoscale devices</a>, but it&#39;s another to study and improve on them — they&#39;re so small they can&#39;t reflect enough light to get a good look. A breakthrough might make that possible, however. UC Riverside researchers <a href="https://news.ucr.edu/articles/2021/11/23/magic-wand-reveals-colorful-nano-world">have built</a> technology that squeezes tungsten lamp light into a 6-nanometer spot at the end of a silver nanowire. That lets scientists produce color imaging at an &quot;unprecedented&quot; level, rather than having to settle for molecular vibrations.</p><p>The developers modified an existing &quot;superfocusing&quot; tool (already used to measure vibrations) to detect signals across the entire visible spectrum. Light travels in a flashlight-like conical path. When the nanowire&#39;s tip passes over an object, the system records that item&#39;s influence on the beam shape and color (including through a spectrometer). With two pieces of specrtra for every 6nm pixel, the team can create color photos of carbon nanotubes that would otherwise appear gray.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This ability to compress light is notable by itself, but the inventors see it playing an important role in nanotechnology. Semiconductor producers could develop more uniform nanomaterials that find their way into chips and other densely-packed devices.

In the excerpt below, Delfanti examines the way in which our current batch of digital robber barons lean on the classic redemption myth to launder their images into that of wonderkids deserving of unabashed praise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5ff87930-47cd-11ec-bc67-889025d6ed0e" alt="The Warehouse Cover" data-uuid="bc5c2a57-a68a-35cd-bea9-48493138c8a2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pluto Press</div></figure><p><em>This is an excerpt from</em> The Warehouse: Workers and Robots at Amazon<em> by Alessandro Delfanti, available now from Pluto Press.</em></p><hr><p>Besides the jobs, trucks and concrete, what Amazon brought to Piacenza and to the dozens of other suburban areas which host its warehouses is a myth: a promise of modernization, economic development, and even individual emancipation that stems from the “disruptive” nature of a company heavily based on the application of new technology to both consumption and work. It is a promise that assumes that the society in question is willing to entrust such ambitions to the gigantic multinational corporations that design, implement, and possess technology. This myth of digital capitalism is based on a number of elements, including magical origins, heroes, and stories of redemption. Some are by now familiar to everyone: A couple of teenagers tinkering away in a garage can revolutionize or create from scratch an entire industry, generating billions in the process. The garage is an important component of this myth. Here we are not talking about the garages where <a href="https://foursquare.com/v/amazon-warehouse-mxp5/5223404c11d2212f3caf1ac3">MXP5</a> workers park their cars after a ten-hour shift in the warehouse, nor about the garages where Amazon Flex couriers store piles of boxes to be delivered. The innovation garage is the site where individuals unbounded by old habits and funded by venture capital turn simple ideas into marketable digital commodities. Nowhere does this myth run deeper than in California: William Hewlett and David Packard’s Palo Alto backyard shack is listed on the US National Register of Historic Places as “the birthplace of Silicon Valley,” while the garage of Steve Jobs’ parents’ house (where he and Steve Wozniak built the first batch of Apple computers) has been recently designated as a “historical site” by the city of Los Altos. These garages have even been turned into informal museums and receive thousands of visitors a year, some even arriving with organized tour buses. For Californian historian Mario Biagioli, the garage has become an important rhetorical device in contemporary discourses, helping mythify the origins of contemporary innovation. Masculine innovation in particular, since the garage is a strictly male space. Bezos himself started Amazon in a garage, albeit not in California—or so Amazon’s origin myth goes: in 1994 he left his lucrative but dull Wall Street hedge fund job and wrote a business plan while driving cross-country from New York to Seattle, where he used his and his family’s money to start the company.</p><p>The myth of the redemption and success of the hero entrepreneur trickles down to the warehouse, insofar as Amazon presents work to its employees through the frame of emancipation. The idea of redemption through work is nothing new. On the contrary, it is a damnation common to modern society. In the early 1960s, militant sociologist Romano Alquati pointed out that the culture of mid-20th century Italian factories included the construction of a “myth” or “cult” of emancipation. In this instance, it was directed at the masses of migrant workers who, following World War II, moved from the rural south to the north of the country to find manufacturing work with the flagship companies of the Italian postwar economic boom, such as FIAT or Olivetti. Redemption from the backwardness of rural life was ensured not only by steady paychecks and the prospect of a pension at the end of the line, but also by participation in technologically advanced production processes—the assembly line of industrial capitalism. Amazon simply repeats and updates such promises. In Italy, for example, Amazon positions itself as an employee-focused company that brings stable employment back to a precarized labor market—a boon to a labor market hit by financial crises, lackluster growth, and lack of opportunities for retraining and upskilling. So Amazon continues a historical trajectory of Italian capitalism, but imports onto the local context novel characteristics borrowed from the American digital corporation model.</p><p>Indeed, digital capitalism updates industrial capitalism’s promise of economic and social emancipation with some novel elements of its own. Rather than simply swapping out the assembly line with the robot or the algorithm, the culture of digital capitalism mixes libertarian ideology with entrepreneurial elements. At the core of this myth lies a form of individualism. The combination of new information technologies with free-market dynamics enables emancipatory potential for the entrepreneur. Furthermore, digital capitalist companies state that they exist to change the world, to make people happy, to create value for everyone and not just for investors—technological optimism at its apex. After all, how could you deliver a bad outcome when your first principle is don’t be evil, as Google’s old slogan famously put it.</p><p>Amazon extends this old myth to all its workers. Indeed, in corporate documents, the company goes so far as to state that everyone is an “owner” at Amazon. While this is quite literal in the case of engineers and executives who receive shares of the company, it can only be understood at the level of mythology for warehouse workers. A figurative or spiritual commitment to the company’s destiny. Managerial techniques used in the warehouse contribute to building this myth, as associates are asked to have fun at work and help Amazon make history, as one of its corporate slogans goes. The myth brings with it the idea that there is no alternative to digital capitalism. Only co-option, or failure for those who can’t keep up or won’t adapt or submit.</p><p>Myths are not just old stories or false beliefs. They are ideas that help us make sense of the world. The myth of digital capitalism itself is not simply fictitious, but instead has very concrete effects. For Big Tech corporations, this myth projects a positive contribution to the world, helping to attract workers and investment, and boost corporate value on financial markets. But it has other concrete effects as well. In different areas of the world, and in different communities, the myth of redemption stemming from participation in high-tech production has impacted economies and cultures. Feminist media studies scholar Lisa Nakamura recounted how, in the 1970s, electronics manufacturers operating on Navajo land in New Mexico justified the employment of Indigenous women. Labor in microchip production was presented as empowering for the crafty and docile Navajo women—assumptions derived from racist stereotyping. Italy is completely different from the Navajo Nation, and yet the idea that an imported version of American digital capitalism can be a force for collective modernization and individual emancipation is alive and well there too. Belief in this myth is evidenced in many different and even contrasting ways. Some bring resources, like the $1.5 billion state-owned venture capital fund launched in 2020 by the Italian government to support start-up companies in the hope they will foster economic growth. Others sell resources off, like when mayors of small towns with high unemployment compete to attract the next Amazon FC, offering the company both farmland newly opened up for development and a local workforce ready to staff the warehouse. Over the years, the mayors of Castel San Giovanni have described the presence of MXP5 as a force of “development” and a source of “pride” for the town. This is not unique to Italy. American mayors are routinely quoted praising the arrival of a new Amazon facility as a “wonderful” or “monumental” thing for their town.</p><p>Amazon’s corporate slogans also hedge up its myth. Central is the valorization of disruption—the idea of a hero entrepreneur defeating the gods of the past. Some of the slogans (the so-called Leadership Principles) are repeated time and again and painted everywhere in the warehouse. While Aboutamazon.com, the company’s corporate website, describes them as “more than inspirational wall hangings,” that is exactly what they sound like. Customer obsession is perhaps the most famous one, a slogan that captures the strategic goal of focusing on customers’ needs: the rest (profits, power) will follow. It also signals that workers are by design an afterthought. Other slogans are even more predictable, like Leaders are right a lot or Think big. Amazon’s myth trickles down to fulfillment centers like MXP5 in many ways. Amazon routinely conducts marketing operations aimed at finding new workers, not new customers. Billboards sporting smiling warehouse workers, recruitment events, and glowing articles commissioned by staffing agencies in the local newspaper are common sights in Piacenza, as in the areas surrounding other FCs. Social media multiplies the message. Amazon encourages employees to join its army of “ambassadors”—workers who plaster social media with positive stories about their job or videos in which they happily dance inside the warehouse. Like the FC’s walls, all these practices are soaked with the Leadership Principles: at a recruitment event near Toronto, slogans, such as Fulfilling the customer promise, were projected as part of a slideshow filled with smiling arrow logos, accompanying a presentation of more mundane details like job descriptions or benefits. “Every Amazonian who wants to be a leader,” we were told, should focus on “customer obsession” and “never settle,” and let’s not forget that Amazonians “are right a lot.” The event wrapped up with free pizza.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-warehouse-alessandro-delfanti-pluto-press-163008791.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdecff70-9242-4d0f-905f-29a9c0b05771</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 27 Nov 2021 16:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637182869</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T21:01:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fd994c90-26ae-11ec-b9ff-7f1d31d64557" width="6334" height="4223" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fd994c90-26ae-11ec-b9ff-7f1d31d64557" width="6334" height="4223" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos arrives for his meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson at the UK diplomatic residence in New York City, New York, U.S., September 20, 2021.

That map doesn&#39;t include any information on the structures nearer its surface, however, and we need that to be able to get a more complete picture of how the planet was formed. Now, a team of scientists was able to <a href="http://www.insight.ethz.ch/en/home/">create</a> the first detailed image of what lies right underneath the planet&#39;s surface, showing three billion years of its history, by listening to Martian winds.</p><p>More precisely, they analyzed the ambient noise (in the absence of marsquakes) collected by the seismometer that was installed by the InSight lander. On Earth, that kind of ambient seismic noise is generated by the ocean, human activity and winds, but only the last one is present on Mars. The Swiss Seismological Service (SED) and ETH Zurich have been regularly analyzing data collected by the seismometer as part of the Marsquake Service. Over the past years, SED was able to develop ways to analyze ambient noise data to define geological structures here on Earth, and those are the techniques they used on the data from InSight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on the data the tool gathered, the top three meters of InSight&#39;s landing site is made of sand, while the next 20 meters are loose material, particularly volcanic rock fissured by meteorite impacts. Underneath that sand and rock lie lava flows divided by sediments that formed when the planet experienced cold and dry conditions. Researchers believe the uppermost lava flows were deposited around 1.7 billion years ago, while the deepest ones were deposited as far back as 3.6 billion years ago at a time when there was a lot more volcanic activity on the planet.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers recently <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26957-7">published</a> their study in <em>Nature</em>, and one of the things they emphasized is that it proves techniques to investigate our planet can also work on Mars.

Whenever you connected to your car over Bluetooth, it would remove extraneous elements like menu buttons and album art. Instead, it gave you large buttons to pause and play music; jump to the previous or next track; or like a specific song. Nifty! But hope you didn&#39;t get too attached, as Spotify has confirmed it&#39;s &quot;retiring&quot; the feature, according to <a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Android/Car-View-missing/m-p/5280149/highlight/true#M181808">a recent support thread</a> (<a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/spotify-is-retiring-car-view-and-users-are-understandably-pissed/">via <em>Android Police</em></a><em>)</em>.</p><p>A Spotify moderator, who was replying to a user who noticed the feature had disappeared from his Android app, noted that Spotify is &quot;actively exploring a variety of new ways to deliver the best in-car listening experience.&quot; They added that removing car view is necessary to &quot;make way for new innovations.&quot; That&#39;s reasonable enough, though it doesn&#39;t excuse dumping a genuinely useful safety feature without a clear replacement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The moderator suggested using Google Assistant (or Siri on iOS) to control Spotify hands-free, something that would also work while navigating with Google or Apple Maps. And, to be fair, that&#39;s how many people (including myself) end up controlling tunes on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be that Spotify is de-prioritizing Car View simply because there are so many other ways to handle music playback in cars. If you&#39;ve got a modern car with CarPlay or Android Auto support, you&#39;ll only be interacting with your in-dash display and will never see Car View in action. Many vehicles made in the last decade also have some sort of media control on their steering wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/499f79b0-4f32-11ec-bb2d-0d9377705bed" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="Spotify Car Thing" data-uuid="4df78042-0aab-3dc2-8c65-55a8b9091bb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Of course, there&#39;s a more nefarious objective, as some Spotify users mentioned in the forum thread. It could be that the company is trying to push people <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-car-thing-preview-180052796.html">towards Car Thing</a>, its $80 display accessory.

Meanwhile, according to <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20211125000787"><em><ins>The Korea Herald</ins></em></a>, Kwon will head up LG’s main holding company.

With the official release of <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/whats-new/">Bitwig Studio 4.1</a> the company is leaning hard into the sort of unpredictable and generative musical ideas it already excels at.</p><p>The big news in 4.1 is a collection of eight new Note FX bringing the total to 23. These allow you to manipulate MIDI on a per-note basis, for example by using an arpeggiator. But the eight new additions get a little more experimental and some take inspiration from the world of physics to deliver semi-random results. Dribble, for example, triggers notes based simulating a bouncing ball, repeating them &quot;until gravity wins.&quot; Ricochet is similar except notes careen around a &quot;room&quot;, retriggering with each collision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3416364750744faf98d798fee7e892b7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bWkeV2_MLJY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Some of the new effects actually lean in the other direction and away from randomization. Quantize, for instance, is all about keeping your notes locked to the beat, though there is some leeway here via the &quot;forgiveness&quot; parameter.&nbsp;</p><p>The new collection of Note FX is rounded out by Humanize, Randomize, Strum, Bend and Note Repeats. The power of these new effects really comes unlocked when you start combining them. Bitwig&#39;s modular nature is part of what makes it so unique, including The Grid, its built-in sound design environment that lets you create custom instruments and effects.&nbsp;</p><p>Bitwig is also intruding a soundpack to take advantage of the added FX called <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/sound-content/notes-in-bloom-112/">Notes in Bloom</a>. Inside are a collection of presets featuring the new Note FX, including some chained together that &quot;make your played and held notes repeat, dance, bounce and create interesting rhythms in real time, so you can use them while playing live.&quot;</p><div id="ab243df3d460479385358b21fefac1eb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2oP92pTmmOM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>If you&#39;ve been considering give Bitwig a try, now is a great time to do it. Both Studio and 16-Track are <a href="https://www.bitwig.com/buy/">on sale</a> until January 11th. The stripped back 16-track edition is marked down to $79, from $99. While the full-fledge Studio version is $100 off, bringing the price to just $299. While $299 isn&#39;t exactly impulse purchase territory, it&#39;s pretty inexpensive in the world of DAWs. Even with a pretty steep 25-percent discount for Black Friday Ableton&#39;s Live 11 suite is $562.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bitwig-studio-41-daw-new-note-fx-midi-194540902.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">67864ecc-be6d-41a5-851c-f44c31ae5e22</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 19:45:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637947437</ingested><modified>2021-11-26T17:24:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5eda76f0-4edc-11ec-bfbf-582332557ffb" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5eda76f0-4edc-11ec-bfbf-582332557ffb" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bitwig]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bitwig Studio 4.1 Note FX]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bitwig Studio 4.1 Note FX]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gaming deals you can get for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When you’re a gamer, you’ve always got an eye out for good deals on your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-deals-black-friday-2021-140052880.html">favorite titles</a>.

The stories once treated these places like a fantasy world on par with Middle Earth or Hyrule, but as we’ve edged closer to them existing in reality they’ve gotten a lot more humdrum, maybe even ordinary. With this shift we’ve seen the real and virtual worlds increasingly collide, and it’s that interconnection between the two that forms the core of the new anime film <em>Belle</em>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Fandango;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Belle" href="https://fave.co/32xOLcb">arriving in US theaters in January</a>.</p><div id="4b2251a17e614fc0b21754abd51e02b7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChneY1MSVFw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Belle</em> is the latest movie from Mamoru Hosoda, the director who brought us time-travel adventures like <em>The Girl Who Leapt Through Time</em> and <em>Mirai</em>. But he’s also known for <em>Summer Wars</em>, a movie that posited a world where everything is connected in the virtual sphere, not just for play but also work, finance and healthcare. Back in 2009, this seemed like a bit of a stretch, but as companies like Google, Apple and Amazon have expanded the concept has become eerily prescient. Now Hosoda is once again tackling the divide between the real and virtual worlds with <em>Belle</em>, a film that splits its time between rural Japan and the computerized world of “U.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Belle</em> is the story of Suzu Naito, a “country bumpkin” living alone with her dad and still dealing with the trauma of losing her mom several years before. When a friend sends her an invite to U she finds it to be an escape from her trauma, a place where she is beautiful and can sing. Her first performance quickly goes viral, with the clip spreading rapidly and her phone blowing up with notifications in a sappy <em>Dear Evan Hansen</em> sort of way. She becomes a sensation, but her newfound fame goes off the rails when one of her concerts is interrupted by a player known only as “The Dragon.” Suzu/Belle becomes intrigued by the Dragon and begins an investigation into his identity, even as self-appointed vigilantes are working to track and expel him from U.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e7e5a7b0-4d76-11ec-a5fe-9d2562736858" alt="Bell&#39;s account" data-uuid="2df8ba61-9409-3609-87a2-3af296ed2c92"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Studio Chizu</div></figure><p>The world and technology of U are interesting, with access gained via an app and a set of special earbuds. The earbuds can apparently overlay sight as well as sound, and they build a person’s avatar using their biometric data. It’s certainly a leap ahead of the bulky VR headsets seen in <em>Ready Player One</em>, or just the “theater of the imagination” that a lot of movies and TV employ, where the virtual as an actual “space” with rooms and buildings and so forth only exists in the minds of the user. Here, it’s more like entering the Metaverse of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming-irl-persona-5-high-school-153046747.html"><em>Persona 5</em></a>, complete with avatars that reflect a person’s true self.</p><p>In U there’s no “if you die in the game you die in real life,” but the biggest threat is still treated as such: to be “unveiled” is to lose your anonymity and have your true form revealed to the world of U, upon which a user will literally fade away from the virtual arena. It’s weird to see this used as a plot hook when real-life social media is overly concerned with real names and verified accounts, but this is a fantasy story, after all.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f50b8f0-4d76-11ec-b178-9ab37a086e78" alt="Belle and the Dragon" data-uuid="ddaa64da-3c9a-3889-9da9-208bc37434b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Studio Chizu</div></figure><p>As such, it takes influence from other fantasy works, most notably Disney’s classic animated feature <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Beauty and the Beast" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/EaRqy9"><em>Beauty and the Beast</em></a>. Both main characters are named Belle, and the design and temperament of the Dragon is very similar to that of the Beast; the mix of animals blended into one hunched, brooding creature, the mysterious castle with a squad of cutesy servant-sidekicks. There’s even a damaged portrait over the fireplace mantle! After years of anime fans complaining about American films “stealing” from anime (<em>Kimba the White Lion</em>, <em>Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water</em> and <em>Perfect Blue</em>), it’s funny to see an anime borrow so blatantly from the West. I can’t wait for the inevitable shot-by-shot comparison videos on YouTube; <em>Belle</em> even recreates the iconic ballroom dancing scene (notable at the time for its early use of CG).</p><p>There is nothing particularly groundbreaking about the animation in <em>Belle</em>, though it is certainly a gorgeous film. The world of U is shown as a city of sweeping towers populated by flying avatars. Animation allows the filmmakers to give each character a unique avatar, of whatever size or shape fits that person best. Suzu becomes a beautiful woman, but others are depicted as babies, fairies and cute animals. The Dragon stands out for being such a dark character, with bruises spread across his back like a fungus.</p><section data-eng-breakout="f326f9dde421458da91a624c8265815a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0f15b2d0-4d77-11ec-97f4-70ec2dce634a" alt="Belle goes missing"></section><p>Where <em>Belle</em> really differentiates itself is how it melds our current internet reality with its future fantasy visions. In early depictions of virtual worlds they were always treated as a separate place that never interacted much with the real world, a “secret life” that users had so very different from their actual existence. As technology moves forward, we’ve largely found that to not be true; our virtual existence is dominated by social media and live-streaming and parasocial relationships, and all of these are generally accepted as part of our “real” lives these days.</p><p>So it is that social media is heavily entwined with spectacle in the world of U, with messages flying as fast and furious as their avatars fly through the computer-generated cities. It isn’t just a thing that “the kids” are into; the residents of U are seen to be an incredibly diverse mix of ages and races, as seen from their messages and videos. But there is still a sense that this space matters more to a particular generation: Context clues reveal that Suzu’s village is a victim of the demographic crisis in Japan, where the populace is aging up with not enough children being born to replace them. Suzu is very much alone a lot of the time in her village, with various chat rooms and the world of U serving as her one constant connection to other people.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/75a928b0-4d77-11ec-bfff-8b83d70e4b39" alt="Suzu and a friend" data-uuid="c65a34a3-0cfc-3be8-81a7-ff89b1e8a318"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Studio Chizu</div></figure><p>In the end, it will be the other people in her real life that will push her to do what she needs to do to save the Dragon.The fantasy elements take a back seat to the fact that there are real people behind each avatar, and just as the service creates a look for them based on their personality, so are their problems in U are just reflections of their real life situations. And in that case, it won’t be Belle who can save the day, but an ordinary girl named Suzu Naito.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/belle-anime-review-190042348.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d4adddd-a876-4f56-a090-090e52fe38af</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 19:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637962981</ingested><modified>2021-11-26T21:43:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b3d9cab0-4d75-11ec-b8b3-2b160b90c4e7" width="1918" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b3d9cab0-4d75-11ec-b8b3-2b160b90c4e7" width="1918" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Studio Chizu]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Belle flying]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Belle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Novation's Circuit Rhythm groovebox is $100 off for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/novation/"><ins>Novation</ins></a> has dropped the price of one of its most recent grooveboxes by 25 percent for Black Friday.

Novation says the machine runs for up to four hours on a single charge, but in testing it typically operated for three to three and a half hours before requiring a recharge. We liked the sampling and slicing features and the simple, intuitive workflow. However, the more advanced features take some getting used to and, if you&#39;re not careful, it&#39;s easy to push an effect like delay, reverb or sidechain from barely noticeable to over the top.</p><p>Novation doesn&#39;t often run sales on its products.

Not only does it double speeds, but it also enables features like HyperSmooth 4.0, which stabilizes footage, tone mapping, noise reduction and a 5.3K maximum resolution at up to 60fps. It can also shoot in 4K at 120fps and 2.7K at 240fps. Like the previous model, the Hero 10 Black has a front screen to make it easier for you to shoot video of yourself, and it supports new horizon leveling option and faster navigation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We knocked the Hero 10 Black for its higher price tag when compared to the Hero 9 Black, but more seriously, the battery life has taken a hit thanks in part to all of the new features the camera supports. In our testing, the Hero 10 Black lasted about one hour and 15 minutes when shooting video at 4K/30fps, but the previous model lasted a full half hour more than that.

You can now get the smart display for $90, $40 less than its original price of $130. The Echo Show 8 listing that comes with six months of free Amazon Music Unlimited also costs $90 at the moment, while the Blink Mini camera bundle that was originally being sold for $165 now only costs $95.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HV1DJy" id="1c771976e9304122be66c5290f90bf9b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 8 (2nd Gen) at Amazon - $90</a><p>In addition, you can get the bundle that comes with a battery base for $40 less at $140, while the bundle with an adjustable stand now only costs $112. The latter is currently $43 less than its original price. We praised the second-gen Echo Show 8 for its minimalist design and features that make it great for video calls in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review</a>. It has a digital pan-and-zoom face-tracking feature that can follow you while you move around and ensure you&#39;re in the frame. The tool works on every video calling platform available for the device, including Skype and Zoom.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also praised the device&#39;s beautiful display with a resolution of 1,280 x 800 pixels and its sound quality that&#39;s better than the Echo Show 5. Unlike its smaller sibling, the bigger device has two speakers instead of one, giving it the capability to deliver surprisingly powerful bass and an impressive volume. Amazon&#39;s Echo Show 8 can serve as a great digital photo frame, alarm clock and kitchen tool to display recipes while cooking. But in case you&#39;re looking for something else, a bunch of other Amazon Echo devices <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-bunch-of-amazon-echo-devices-are-already-on-sale-for-black-friday-083029077.html">went on sale</a> a few days ago.

At $500, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Mavic Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3nUZEgu">Mavic Mini</a> is expensive for a high-tech toy, but much more affordable that full-sized drones. But for today only, you can get the Mini in a combo pack for $200 off, bringing it down to $300. The pack includes the drone, the remote control, three batteries, three pairs of spare propellers, a number of cables and extra control sticks and a carrying bag.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nUZEgu" id="be47c9a49cc34c8dbcf153007f2eb52a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Mavic Mini combo pack at Amazon - $300</a><p>DJI is known for making impressive drones, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-09-dji-mavic-mini-review.html">Mavic Mini</a> is no exception. One of the biggest hurdles of flying a drone is deciding to take it with you, and that can be a difficult decision when you have a massive flying machine to consider. But the Mavic Mini is small enough that it can really come with you anywhere without inducing much anxiety. When folded up, it&#39;s roughly the size of a soda can and weighs about the same as a large smartphone, making it light and fairly discrete.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also pretty easy to fly, and you can do so with either your smartphone or the included remote. It holds up to wind decently, and although it doesn&#39;t have obstacle avoidance like DJI&#39;s larger drones, it does have GPS and a downward-facing sensor that helps it hold position even when you don&#39;t have satellite reception. The Mini shoots video in 2.7K/30fps or 1080p/60fps and it supports Dronie, Rocket, Circule and Helix QuickShots, which are automatic moves that the drone can perform to get some cool footage in a short amount of time. There&#39;s no ActiveTrack on the Mini, which is a bummer, but it&#39;s to be expected that DJI would save some advanced features for its higher-end models.</p><p>Our biggest gripes with the Mavic Mini are the fewer smart modes at its disposal, along with the core camera features it&#39;s missing and a slightly flakey video stream over WiFi connectivity. Otherwise, it&#39;s a solid, compact drone that&#39;s a great options for those eager to get their hands on one of these gadgets without dropping too much money.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
