But, in 2021, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google continued to improve their operating systems for machines that do double duty. Windows 11 has features that make it friendlier for multi-screen devices, while Android 12L is on the horizon and promises an optimized experience for larger displays. Plus, with the rise of ARM-based chips for laptops, especially Apple’s impressive M1 series, prospects for a powerful 2-in-1 with a vast touch-friendly app ecosystem is at an all-time high.</p><p>These machines still have their limits, of course. Since they’re smaller than proper laptops, they tend to have less-powerful processors. Keyboards also tend to be less sturdy, with condensed layouts and shallower key travel. Plus, they’re almost always tablets first, leaving you to buy a keyboard case separately. (And those ain’t cheap.) So, you can’t always assume the advertised price is what you’ll actually spend on the 2-in-1 you want.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sometimes, getting a third-party keyboard might be just as good, and they’re often cheaper than first-party offerings. If you’re looking to save some money, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Slim Folio" href="https://amzn.to/2K0q2DT">Logitech’s Slim Folio</a> is a cheaper option, and if you don’t need your keyboard to attach to your tablet, Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3eYAHe0">K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard</a> is also a good pick.</p><p>While we’ve typically made sure to include a budget 2-in-1 in previous years, this time there isn’t a great choice. We would usually go with a Surface Go, but the 2021 model is too expensive. Other alternatives, like cheaper Android tablets, are underpowered and don’t offer a great multitasking interface. If you want something around $500 that’s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you’re better off this year looking at a conventional laptop (like those on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">our best budget PCs list</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c7370210-25c8-11eb-bfef-f2bf92a9b702" alt="Apple iPad Pro 12.9 2020"><figcaption>Chris Velazco / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>When you’re shopping for a 2-in-1, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First, look at the spec sheet to see how heavy the tablet is (alone, and with the keyboard). Most modern hybrids weigh less than 2 pounds, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">the 1.96-pound Surface Pro 8</a> being one of the heaviest around. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad Pro 12.9 (2021)</a> and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7+ are both slightly lighter. If the overall weight of the tablet and its keyboard come close to 3 pounds, you’ll be better off just getting an ultraportable laptop.</p><p>You’ll also want to opt for an 11-inch or 12-inch screen instead of a smaller 10-inch model. The bigger displays will make multitasking easier, plus their companion keyboards will be much better spaced. Also, try to get 6GB of RAM if you can for better performance — you’ll find this in the base model of the Galaxy Tab S7+, while this year’s iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 8 start with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Finally, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more, and that’s not counting what you’ll pay for data. And, as for 5G — you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that’s barely faster than LTE.&nbsp;</p><h2>Engadget Picks</h2><h2>Best overall: Surface Pro 8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/088f94b0-2533-11ec-b9a3-0ab15069c542" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 8 and Signature Pro Keyboard accessory." data-uuid="27319964-9d1e-3c8f-8e95-daa497cb8401"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no beating the Surface series when it comes to 2-in-1s. They’re powerful, sleek tablets running an OS that’s actually designed for productivity. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro 8" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm">Surface Pro 8</a> is Microsoft’s latest and it addresses most of the issues we had with its predecessor. It’s thinner and looks more modern, borrowing the design of last year’s Pro X. Plus, it has a 120Hz display that makes scrolling endless spreadsheets or emails feel much faster. Just remember to drop the refresh rate to 60Hz if you want to get respectable battery life out of this thing. Windows 11 also offers a better split-screen experience for on-the-go multitasking.</p><p>Like most of the other 2-in-1s on this list, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">Pro 8</a> doesn’t come with a keyboard cover — you’ll have to pay extra for that. That’s a shame, considering it starts at $1,099. Microsoft offers a variety of Type Covers for its Surface Pros ranging from $100 to $180, depending on whether you want a slot for a stylus on it. But at least they’re comfortable and well-spaced. You can also get the Surface Slim Pen 2 ($130) for sketching out your diagrams or artwork, and it also features haptic feedback for a more responsive experience.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm" id="c2e258171d43476ba6c01350018b5e56" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Surface Pro 8 at Microsoft starting at $1,099</a><h2>Best for Apple users: 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/6c1a9ec0-b815-11eb-8b33-87fbb637229f" style="height:1542;width:3000;" alt="Apple iPad Pro (2021) review" data-uuid="9ab5c248-d237-3cd3-9d5c-a973b9bcf0da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, the best option for you is obviously an iPad. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:12-inch Pro" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9">12-inch Pro</a> is our pick. Like older models, this iPad Pro has a stunning 12.9-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, but this year it uses mini-LED backlighting to deliver greater dynamic range. Apple’s M1 chipset is impressively fast too, and more than good enough for most tasks. Plus, the latest iPadOS is superior to older versions thanks to widgets and quick notes support.</p><p>Apple’s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Magic Keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3HpetiZ">Magic Keyboard</a> provides a satisfying typing experience, and its trackpad means you won’t have to reach for the screen to launch apps. But it’ll also cost you an extra $300, making it the most expensive case on this list by a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad</a> also lacks a headphone jack and its webcam is awkwardly positioned along the left bezel when you prop it up horizontally, so be aware that it’s still far from a perfect laptop replacement. Still, with its sleek design and respectable battery life, the iPad Pro 12.9 is a good 2-in-1 for Apple users.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9" id="f16fcb2f983c407eb02d3247a2abe4f4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 12.9-inch iPad Pro at Amazon - $1,099</a><h2>Best for Android users: Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/7db721a0-25c9-11eb-be9f-3d20d2583a4c" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+"><figcaption>Cherlynn Low / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>While Windows is better than iPadOS and Android for productivity, it lags the other two when it comes to apps specifically designed for touchscreens. If you want a tablet that has all the apps you want, and only need it to occasionally double as a laptop, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the Galaxy Tab S7+" href="https://fave.co/32jotag">the Galaxy Tab S7+</a> is a solid option. Though it was released last year, it’s still the best Android-powered 2-in-1 around. You’ll enjoy watching movies and playing games on its gorgeous 12.4-inch 120Hz AMOLED screen, and Samsung includes the S Pen, which is great for sketching and taking notes. The Snapdragon 865+ processor and 6GB of RAM keep things running smoothly, too.</p><p>Thankfully the company significantly improved its keyboard case over previous models, with more comfortable and responsive keys. You could type for hours on this thing and not hate yourself (or Samsung). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-hands-on-specs-price-120-hz-140031993.html">battery life </a>is also excellent, so you won’t need to worry about staying close to an outlet. The main caveat is that Android isn’t great as a desktop OS and, while Samsung’s DeX mode offers a somewhat workable solution, it has plenty of quirks. Still, with Android 12L on the horizon, a simple software update could ease some pain.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/32jotag" id="7c4da650d1604f09851af931cbef458e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Tab S7+ at Samsung - $849</a><h2>Best Chrome OS option: HP Chromebook x2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="46699dc1-436f-320f-844c-75a7f6cc25a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Android might suck as a desktop operating system, but Chrome OS doesn’t.

You might find some other smart conveniences on higher-end models, but &quot;less is more&quot; has usually been the way. <a href="https://newurtopia.com/pages/carbon-ebike">Urtopia</a>, the latest e-bike brand from China, has other ideas. Its debut ride is, on paper, one of the most tech-heavy bikes we’ve seen. The spec sheet reads more like a phone’s than a next-gen fixie.</p><p>For example, beyond the 250W hub motor with three levels of riding assist (and an estimated 30-80 mile range), there’s an integrated dot-matrix display, a fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G (via eSIM), mmWave sensors for vehicle detection, an integrated alarm and, well… the list goes on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bike itself has a striking aesthetic that doesn’t bother to hide the fact that this is possibly the most technologically advanced model you’ll see this year. The frame was designed by Mathis Heller who has experience with BMW and IKEA among others, and it’s pure curves and racing lines. The stealth bomber look is further enhanced with all the cables hidden from view inside the frame. The Urtopia is pitched as a city bike and while the (removable) battery isn’t overly obvious, there’s no doubt to even the most casual of glances that you’re not wielding a regular analog pedaller.</p><p>When this thing arrived, I was dreading putting it together. Previous experience has taught me that while not complex, you’ll want to set aside some time (and space) to get things set up. Turns out, the prototype model I tested only really needed the front wheel inserted and the tires pumped and I was good to go.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/780bc4b0-51f4-11ec-abbd-076651e3d916" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="c91cbd19-8f23-3cec-874a-16a5b7db518e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The obvious draw here for gadget fans will be the “smartbar” — an onboard computer built right into the handlebars. The dot matrix display is the centerpiece of the bike and only dials up that “bike from the future” vibe. On the right-hand side where the bell would usually be is the fingerprint reader which interacts with the computer in a few ways (it’s also a digital bell). The left-hand side houses the four-way D-pad which is where you change modes and settings along with powering the bike on (but not off, more on that later).</p><p>Despite that long list of smart features, not all of them were available to test on the prototype I was sent. The hardware for the mmWave sensors is there, but there’s no way to activate it. The GPS and eSIM require the companion app to work and that’s not ready yet also. Sadly, those are some very interesting features we’ll have to wait and see on, but most everything else was present and correct.</p><p>Before the fun stuff, the basic e-bike functionality (power/speeds/range etc.) appears to be on par with other hub-motor bikes I’ve tried. For example, I recently tested the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html">Tenways city bike</a>, which has a 250W battery and motor compared to the Urtopia’s 360Wh cell. But both have 250W torque-based brushless hub motors and the same Gates carbon belt.</p><p>Things get more exciting once you turn the bike on. You’ll be greeted with a wooshing sound from the speaker in the smartbar and the company logo appearing on the display before defaulting back to the speedometer. I am informed that some of the sounds will be user-configurable and I hope that includes the option to turn them off. Before you ride, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the controls. Up and down on the D-pad will cycle through the assistance levels: Pedal mode, Eco, Comfort and Sport (there’s also a “Turbo” mode which is akin to a “throttle” mode).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cb91c1c0-51f4-11ec-b7a5-e507c68cec56" alt="Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground." data-uuid="85d2b99f-3f8d-3165-9e20-59572f950dbc"><figcaption>Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Tap left or right, and you’ll be presented with turn signals projected on the ground (these also remain on when the lights are on but flash when you initiate a turn). To switch the actual lights on, however, involves speaking to the bike — there’s no manual control, only voice.</p><p>This is where things get a little goofy. Urtopia warns in its press materials that the voice recognition system hasn’t been fully “trained.” Yet, for me, it worked perfectly. Perhaps they only trained it on dull-voiced Britons? Anyway, to turn the lights on you’ll need to place a digit on the fingerprint reader and wait for the face icon to appear on the screen letting you know you can issue your command like some sort of Belgian Michael Knight. It’s cool but I’d still like a physical switch so that I don’t have to talk to my bike in public, not least because when you’re riding, it’s harder for the smartbar to hear your voice thanks to the rustling wind, etc. The result is you either have to stop for a second or lean into the handlebars as you go, neither is very elegant.</p><p>The list of things you can currently control with your voice includes: Change speed mode, lock the bike, indicate a turn and change the smartbar’s volume. All of those, bar the volume (and lights) have physical controls too. It’s a cute idea and presents a hands-free option, but in practice, I do wonder how useful it is over a nice button you can mash.</p><p>Another feature that feels like technology doesn’t necessarily improve is the bell. On this bike it’s built into the fingerprint reader. A long press activates voice recognition, a short press will emit a digital “ring ring.” It works fine, but it’s not as responsive as a physical bell would be. I had times where I was approaching someone from behind and wanted to alert them to my presence, only for the bell to sound half a second after I passed them. Other times it took two or three tries for it to even trigger.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f2945440-51f4-11ec-b56f-93f073644eb7" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="7083c232-007e-38cd-8256-b9e1918f4447"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The experience with the alarm also needs a little smoothing out. I love the idea that I can leave the bike “locked” and if anyone moves it, it’ll issue an audible alarm. The problem is, the Urtopia will do this <em>any</em> time it’s locked. This might seem fine until you learn that “locked” is basically “standby” and the bike will be in this mode as soon as you connect the battery. So if you put the battery in and then start wheeling the bike out the front door, the alarm will sound.</p><p>There’s an easy fix for this, but also not entirely helpful. Simply turn the bike on and that will disable the alarm. In fairness, this is a quirk of it being a prototype. Production models will allow you to disable the alarm with the fingerprint sensor or the companion app, but this isn’t something I could test. It’s worth mentioning that, right now, there’s no actual way to turn the bike off other than by removing the battery, so fingers crossed these are some kinks that can be ironed out by launch. I asked a company representative if this was the plan and he confirmed that it was.</p><p>So, tech aside, what does this thing ride like? The sitting position puts you leaning forward in more of a racer pose than a typical town bike where you might be more upright. It’s comfortable though, even after mid to long rides (the longest I managed was 11 miles but I was up for more) although the Velo saddle could be a little easier on the butt — it’s fairly hard and doesn’t appear to be gel-lined.</p><p>In pedal mode, there’s no noticeable resistance from the motor as expected with a hub of this type. At 13Kg/30 pounds, it’s pretty light for an e-bike — mostly thanks to the carbon fiber body. This means if you don’t want to use the battery it’s still a functional regular bike. Tap up on the D-pad though and things get fun real quick. Like most e-bikes, the Urtopia is limited on its power assistance based on territories. The US version tops out at 20 MPH before you’re on your own and the EU version will cap out at 16 MPH of electric assistance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/133a0690-51f5-11ec-b7ff-709bc06f91d5" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="00c4c1eb-bd0f-3001-b345-19a6aacc6f76"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The three power modes all feel pretty fast. That’s to say, even “eco” mode will help you along nicely. Step up to Comfort mode and you probably have nearly all the power you need to get where you’re going and have a good balance of exercise and assistance. In Sport mode, this thing feels really quite fast despite the standard limitations. I often found myself dropping back down to Comfort mode when other humans were near as it can feel quite lively — in a good way.</p><p>If you really are feeling like chilling out and letting the bike do all the work, there’s also that Turbo mode. Long press Up on the D-pad and even the lightest of pedaling will soon get you to 20mph. Given the racey aesthetic and the forward seating position, this is a lot of fun for not a lot of effort.</p><p>With that in mind, I should mention the range. Urtopia claims you should be good for anything between 30 and 80 assisted miles. This will obviously depend on the terrain and which power mode you’re in, and it’s quite a wide estimate. I haven’t run the battery down yet, but the indicator on the smartbar did seem to get quite low even on a 10-mile ride. It’s hard to know if this is a prototype quirk or just that the battery is draining fast (which, again, could be something that changes in final hardware with final firmware? Hard to know).</p><p>This is why I saved the section on GPS and the 4G connectivity until now. One of the more interesting selling points here for me is that you will be able to track and locate the bike on a map at almost any time. The company tells me it plans to offer data bundles for the 4G connectivity for about $30 a year — which seems pretty reasonable for the peace of mind of being able to locate your bike anywhere if it were to go missing. My question is… what impact might this have on the battery if it’s pinging GPS and running 4G while idle? Alas, a question I can’t answer until we get to try the final model.</p><p>The same question goes for the mmWave sensors. Another thing I am currently unable to test.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I do know is that as the bike is right now, it’s incredibly fun to ride and thanks to the weight, fairly easy to handle (I live in a fifth-floor apartment, so wrangling it into the small elevator is thankfully more manageable). The techno styling might not be to everyone’s taste, but I’m quite fond of it. And most importantly, it’s nice to see something so tech-forward, even if some of the headline features weren’t ready. I am eager to try them once they are and after speaking with the company I got the sense there is more to come. I jokingly suggested they should allow music through the smartbar speaker (the bike has Bluetooth) and they suggested that was possible as are the required OTA updates to deliver such new features.</p><p>Right now, the Urtopia is available for pre-order via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/">Indiegogo</a>. As such, the standard caveats apply, but given how close to final the prototype I have is, it doesn’t seem like there’s any more development to be done, just some fine-tuning on those remaining features. If you do pre-order you’ll be able to pick one up for $2,000 which is a really competitive price even for the bike without those extra features enabled. According to the campaign, that price will almost double once it goes to retail, so if you’re taken by what you see, there’s a decent incentive to get on board sooner rather than later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d22f9960-78f3-457a-98f7-340bd51ebe45</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638365917</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T13:38:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e6a90-51e6-11ec-b7f7-5b241ac80010" width="2000" height="1245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e6a90-51e6-11ec-b7f7-5b241ac80010" width="2000" height="1245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urtopia ebike,]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urtopia ebike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's 2021 Wrapped is here to chronicle your year in music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early December, Spotify rolls out its Wrapped year-in-review so that users can relive their go-to artists, songs and podcasts from the last several months.

Lenovo also moved the speakers to the front of the device, resulting in a larger chin underneath the display.

Otherwise, the Smart Clock 2 can do everything the original device can, including show weather forecasts, enable alarms, play music and control smart home devices. Lenovo also kept a camera out of the equation yet again, which will make the Smart Clock 2 a more appealing option for those who have no desire to video chat using the alarm on their bedside table.</p><p>We can&#39;t speak for the quality of the Lenovo smart light bulb that&#39;s included in the bundle, but we can say that it supports white and color options with adjustable temperature and brightness. In addition to the companion mobile app, you can control the bulb using the Google Assistant or Alexa — and we expect you may do so using the former quite a bit if you pick up this bundle. If you have a small room in your home that you want to make a bit smarter, this Lenovo bundle is a solid, inexpensive way to do that.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-lenovo-smart-clock-2-bundled-with-a-smart-light-is-on-sale-for-25-right-now-135610566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88701aff-c08d-4794-be96-d7cc5b30ca5f</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 13:56:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638366974</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T13:56:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A gray Lenovo Smart Clock 2 on a wireless charging dock with its screen facing the camera.

Investors voted in favor of passing a proposal requesting the annual report at their recent meeting despite the company&#39;s recommendation that they vote against it.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-shareholders-force-company-to-disclose-sexual-harassment-data-11638309907?mod=rss_Technology"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Microsoft has been planning to disclose how it implements sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies even before the vote took place. However, the company didn&#39;t want to reveal independent investigations into its executives, including the probe into Bill Gates. One of the proposal&#39;s key requests is the disclosure of executive-level investigations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the news that Bill and Melinda Gates were having a divorce, reports came out accusing the former of questionable behavior. The Microsoft co-founder allegedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html">pursued women</a> who worked for him at the tech giant and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, Microsoft&#39;s board of directors opened an investigation after discovering that he had an affair with an employee around 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The greater transparency around sexual harassment in the company was proposed by financial services provider Arjuna Capital. Natasha Lamb, a portfolio manager at Arjuna, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/microsoft-investors-vote-for-review-following-bill-gates-scandal">said during the meeting</a> that the investor is &quot;concerned about Microsoft&#39;s alleged continued culture of workplace sexual harassment and its history of unfulfilled previous commitments to resolve it.&quot; Arjuna said the reports about the probe into Gates&#39; affair and behavior that came out earlier this year &quot;put into question whether Microsoft was maintaining and protecting a culture of sexual harassment, especially seeing how Bill Gates was protected around this issue by the board.&quot;</p><p>Despite advising against voting for the proposal, Microsoft will take steps to comply with it. Company President Brad Smith said Microsoft will bring in a third party to assess its investigations and will share what those assessments contain. He also gave a taste of what the annual reports would include: Apparently, the tech giant received 51 complaints from employees in the fiscal year ending in June, and 47 percent of them were substantiated. The year before that, it received 142 complaints.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">115492f9-139e-43f4-a783-5ad04ea14dc2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 11:38:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638358754</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 27: CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella and CEO of Volkswagen, Herbert Diess (not seen) attend a session during their visit to Volkswagen Digital Lab in Berlin, Germany on February 27, 2019.

The company says firmware version 3.0.999.284 significantly improves the feature&#39;s performance, stability and accuracy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">HTC&#39;s Vive Focus 3</a> launched with hand tracking back in July, allowing users to use their hands as controllers. With this software engine upgrade, HTC says the headset will be able to track fast hand movements more easily and recognize pinch-to-zoom gestures more accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the company opened the feature to developers, these improvements would translate to better hand tracking within applications. Developers can integrate the headset&#39;s six current predefined hand gestures into their VR apps, and HTC previously <a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/support/focus3/category_howto/hand-tracking.html">said</a> that additional gestures will be added in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HTC said in its announcement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Being able to navigate virtual environments naturally and intuitively will go a long way towards making VR more accessible to everyone, no matter their familiarity with technology. As we step into the metaverse era, we couldn’t be more excited to bring these quality-of-life improvements to all VIVE Focus 3 customers around the world.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>When the manufacturer launched the Vive Focus 3 back in July, we found it to be the best standalone VR headset yet. It&#39;s not a direct competitor to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-mobile-mixed-reality-camera-204734242.html">Quest 2</a>, however, seeing as it costs $1,300. Unlike the Oculus (now Meta) headset, it targets business users and not ordinary consumers who want to enjoy VR experiences in their own home.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-hand-tracking-update-090734043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20694278-b445-42b5-8b46-e444882e4825</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 09:07:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638349691</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T09:08:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virtual modular synth VCV Rack 2 is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://vcvrack.com/news/2021-11-30-Rack-2-released">VCV Rack 2</a> has arrived, and it could help you figure out if modular synthesis is something you can get into before blowing a fortune on it. The original app dropped in 2017, giving you access to thousands of virtual modules that let you try Eurorack for free. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-virtual-eurorack-synth-november-vst-plugin-superbooth-223810427.html">upgraded app</a> comes with a completely redesigned user interface with a dark room mode and a much better module browser than its predecessor. VCV has a library of almost 2,700 modules, and the new browser will make them easier to sort with its category filters and the capability to highlight the modules you use the most.</p><p>While the app itself is still free to download and use, there&#39;s now a Pro version that includes a VST plugin for full integration into the digital audio workstation of your choice. That means you&#39;ll be able to use VCV Rack within Ableton, Logic or even GarageBand. The Pro tier also comes with professional support — and the promise of more plugin formats in the future. Rack 2&#39;s paid version will set you back $99 until 2022, though you can also get it bundled with VCV Drums and VCV Sound Stage for $209. You can get both paid and free VCV Rack 2 versions right now from its <a href="https://vcvrack.com/Rack">official page</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="55250e107f2e40e0a46b5e69fcfbe1f7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYft3MFOCJQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-now-available-060611374.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9222d1d9-01b2-4ac4-b207-ca197d51f81a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 06:06:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638338807</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T06:06:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch will use machine learning to catch ban-dodging trolls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch is introducing a new machine learning feature to help streamers protect their channels from people attempting to avoid bans.

In many cases, they targeted creators from marginalized communities.

This year was no different with the company taking the opportunity to unveil the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. That’s right, for the second year in a row, Qualcomm is moving away from the sequential numbering scheme that has defined its processors for years. Just as the Snapdragon 865 gave way to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">888</a>, the company will now replace the 888 with the Gen 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The system-on-a-chip includes Qualcomm’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-10-gigabit-5g-modem-x65-151851346.html"><ins>X65 5G modem</ins></a>. The company says it’s capable of theoretical download speeds of 10Gbps. That’s one of those specs that’s impressive on paper, but won’t mean much out in the real world since some of the fastest 5G networks can’t deliver speeds greater than 4Gbps in ideal conditions. If you have access to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-linksys-wifi-6e-routers-now-available-130016648.html"><ins>WiFi 6 or 6E</ins></a> router, the Gen 1 can sustain download speeds of 3.6 Gbps over WiFi.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with its past flagship chipsets, Qualcomm has put significant effort into improving the camera experience. The Gen 1 features an 18-bit image signal processor. That’s a first for the company, and something it says allows the component to process 4,000 times more data than the 14-bit Spectra ISP found on the Snapdragon 888. Additionally, phones with the Gen 1 will have the ability to capture photos at 3.2 gigapixels per second. In practice, that means the Gen 1 can process data from three 36-megapixel cameras simultaneously without any shutter lag, according to Qualcomm.</p><p>In another first for a mobile device, the company says the chipset can record 8K HDR footage at 30 frames per second. Again, that’s not the most practical feature for a phone in 2021 since 4K is the top end for most content. On that note, the Gen 1 supports UHD capture at 120 frames per second and can record slow motion footage at 960 frames per second at 720p. Separate from its Spectra ISP, the Gen 1 includes a always-on image signal processor that can power a camera while consuming very little battery power. It’s a feature that will allow Gen 1-equipped devices to offer always-on face detection for biometric authentication.</p><p>The Gen 1 won’t offer greatly improved CPU performance over what was already possible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html"><ins>Snapdragon 888 Plus</ins></a>. What it does promise is faster performance when it comes to AI-related tasks. That’s thanks to Qualcomm’s new seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is up to four times faster than its predecessor thanks to more shared memory and a faster tensor accelerator. Gaming performance is another highlight of the Gen 1. According to Qualcomm, its latest Adreno GPU offers 30 percent faster rendering performance while consuming 25 percent less power. Over on the audio front, the Gen 1 includes support for Qualcomm’s recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html"><ins>aptX Lossless</ins></a> Bluetooth codec. It can deliver up to CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection.</p><p>Rounding out the Gen 1’s feature list is a dedicated Trust Management Engine. The Gen 1 is the first mobile chipset to support Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-ready-se-alliance-204241463.html"><ins>Android Ready SE</ins></a> standard out of the box, which means it has the capability to store things like digital car keys and IDs.</p><p>With its mix of performance improvements and new features, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 offers an intriguing look at the next generation of Android flagships. Now we have to wait to see what capabilities manufacturers decide to enable in their latest devices. The first Gen 1-equipped phones will arrive later this year, with more expected to come in the first half of 2022.</p><p>Separately, Qualcomm announced it’s partnering with Google to bring the company’s Neural Architecture Search platform to its product portfolio. The technology, which will be available first on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, allows companies to create and optimize AI models automatically instead of manually. According to Google, NAS optimize AI models in weeks rather than months.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd9c5a4e-3bdd-40fb-be9b-6c557850dc67</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637948983</ingested><modified>2021-11-26T17:49:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db5e8100-4edf-11ec-b7fe-fcedab9b4b76" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db5e8100-4edf-11ec-b7fe-fcedab9b4b76" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quest headset owners can capture VR gameplay using their phones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta’s Reality Labs unit is rolling out one last <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update/">major software update</a> for the Quest and Quest 2 before the end of the year. And it’s one you’ll want to download as soon as you can because it adds some handy features.</p><div id="702703689cb942b6b532801467f94467"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I19tJ6ijmcI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>One of them allows you to record yourself while inside a game or app. If you own a VR headset, you’ve probably seen videos like the one above where you can see how a game physically plays. Before today, you needed special equipment to capture footage from that mixed reality perspective. With the new update, you can use your phone instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1a090250-521d-11ec-adff-c37d981c5147" style="height:1125;width:1125;" alt="Mobile mixed reality camera" data-uuid="2f6d72d8-e5ff-38b4-8da6-c37f18781354"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reality Labs</div></figure><p>Naturally, the final result isn’t as polished as the above video, but you can still get an idea of how games like <em>Beat Saber </em>play out in the real world. You’ll need an iPhone XS or above with iOS 11 or higher to use the new mobile mixed reality camera. With today’s release, about a dozen games support the feature, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-07-superhot-vr-feels-like-a-time-bending-action-packed-puzzle.html"><em><ins>Superhot VR</ins></em></a>, <em>Pistol Whip</em> and <em>Synth Riders</em>.</p><p>The update also includes a number of features Meta said were coming “soon” at its Connect conference in late October. To start, you can now make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-oculus-audio-calling-171524999.html"><ins>voice calls</ins></a> through the Messenger app on Quest and Quest 2 headsets. The feature allows you to not only call other Quest users, but you can also dial up your Facebook friends.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/47e06420-521d-11ec-bfcf-3a775a8506e8" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Reality Labs app sharing" data-uuid="950773c6-6637-3725-902d-7619cff8168a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reality Labs</div></figure><p>Starting today, some games will also allow you to back up your save data to the cloud. The feature may not be immediately available on your headset after downloading the update. That’s because Reality Labs says it’s rolling it out at a slower pace to make sure it works correctly. Additionally, it’s an opt-in feature for developers, so not every game may support it even after it’s broadly available. While not new to the Quest platform, today’s update also removes the experimental tag that had been applied to the multi-user and app sharing features that were introduced at the start of the year.</p><p>Lastly, while not directly related to today’s update, in the “coming weeks” Reality Labs plans to introduce new customization options to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>. To start, you’ll have the option to choose from multiple virtual office environments and the ability to decorate the space with custom posters and your company&#39;s logo.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-mobile-mixed-reality-camera-204734242.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64552496-f253-44da-a554-27bccbfbb99e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 20:47:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638305260</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T20:47:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/feaff8b0-521c-11ec-a777-1e1105c372ab" width="1728" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/feaff8b0-521c-11ec-a777-1e1105c372ab" width="1728" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta Reality Labs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Quest Cloud Backups]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Quest Cloud Backups]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch now works with SharePlay on the iPhone and iPad]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch/">Twitch</a> has <a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/appleshareplay?language=en_US#faq">rolled out</a> another feature designed to bring viewers closer together.

They claim Google fired them for organizing worker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-24-google-faces-protest-over-worker-organization.html">opposition to controversial projects</a>, like working with the Trump-era Customs and Border Protection. They were supposedly punished for pointing out evil like Google as instructed, in other words.</p><p>The one-time employees claimed Google rejected the famous phrase as it was both expensive and leading workers to organize. The internet firm supposedly decided it was better to fire people than admit its approach had changed and give up the &quot;accompanying benefits&quot; that came with its well-known motto.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are concerns the lawsuit is too vague. What defines evil, exactly? However, plaintiff lawyer Laurie Burgess argued &quot;don&#39;t be evil&quot; was specific enough that it could be enforceable. The saying &quot;must have meaning&quot; if it was in the company code and thus binding, Burgess said.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Google for comment. It has previously accused all of the workers (plus Laurence Berland) of repeatedly violating data security policies by obtaining or sharing confidential data, but the workers and other critics have said this was just a cover for retaliatory action.</p><p>The lawsuit won&#39;t necessarily lead to stiff penalties.

The custom organisms can collect &quot;hundreds&quot; of individual cells in their dishes to spontaneously assemble baby bots that grow up within a few days. As this happens over and over, you could use the reproduction to amass however robots you need  to deliver drugs, remove microplastics from rivers or otherwise complete small-scale tasks.</p><p>The replication method is as notable as the bots themselves. The cells would normally develop into tadpole skin, but the computer-designed cell mix instead uses the &quot;kinematic&quot; (motion-based) replication normally seen only with molecules.

While the pressure leak never posed an immediate threat to those aboard, it set off a bizarre turn of events that saw Russia open an investigation to find out if the incident was the result of sabotage.</p><p>Per an <a href="https://ria.ru/20211126/kosmos-1760833889.html"><em>RIA Novosti</em></a> article spotted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/russia-threatens-criminal-charges-against-a-nasa-astronaut/?"><em>Ars Technica</em></a>, the country&#39;s Roscosmos space agency recently completed its probe of the event and sent the results to Russian law enforcement officials, opening the door for them to announce criminal charges. Roscosmos didn&#39;t&#39; say anything official about the cause of the pressure leak, but that hasn&#39;t stopped Russian media from spreading misinformation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>RIA Novosti</em> article references Russian media reports that allege the hole may have been drilled by NASA astronaut Serena Auñón-Chancellor, a crew member of the ISS at the time of the incident. Specifically, per Russia&#39;s <a href="https://tass.com/science/1366691"><em>TASS</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>news agency, the country&#39;s<em> Izvestia</em> newspaper claimed Aunon-Chancellor may have drilled the hole out of a &quot;desire to return to Earth because of a blood clot or a fight with her onboard the International Space Station.&quot; Citing its own source, TASS claims &quot;the hole had been drilled in weightlessness by a person not acquainted with the spaceship&#39;s design.&quot;</p><p>According to NASA, the possibility that its astronauts were involved in creating the pressure leak is non-existent. As <em>Ars Technica</em> notes, NASA knew the location of all of its astronauts before the leak started and the moment it began. None of the US astronauts aboard the ISS at the time of the incident were near the Russian compartment where the Soyuz was docked when it started leaking air. The US shared this information with Russia when Roscosmos began its investigation in 2018.</p><p>&quot;These attacks are false and lack any credibility,&quot; NASA Administrator Bill Nelson told the outlet. &quot;I fully support Serena and stand behind all of our astronauts.&quot; We&#39;ve reached out to NASA for additional information.</p><p>The accusations come at a time when the relationship between NASA and Roscosmos is already fraught. On November 15th, Russia <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/russia-acknowledges-anti-satellite-test-but-says-its-no-big-deal/">conducted an anti-satellite missile test</a> that created a debris field that forced astronauts on the ISS to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-debris-field-215745675.html">seek shelter aboard their spacecraft</a>.

Given that many of the studio&#39;s games are about exploration (such as those in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series), progressing to space exploration with <em>Starfield </em>is a logical next step. Art director Matt Carofano noted the upcoming game has a &quot;more realistic, science-based backing to it&quot; than, say, the fantasy world of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/skyrim/"><em>Skyrim</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Game director Todd Howard also offered a &quot;cryptic&quot; tease.

Back then, not everyone was excited about the return of the company’s cofounder. Even though he initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-11-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-out.html">came back</a> temporarily, employees and investors were concerned that dual CEO roles — he was, and still is, the CEO of Square — would keep him from being able to tackle the company’s many problems.</p><p>“The general feeling among Twitter employees now is trepidation,” <em>The New York Times </em>wrote <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/13/technology/jack-dorsey-returns-to-twitter-as-chief-to-shrugs-and-quips.html">in 2015</a> of Dorsey’s surprise return. “Many are concerned at the prospect of Mr. Dorsey’s interim title becoming permanent, given his divisive and sometimes erratic management style and the fact that he had been dismissed and returned to the company before.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the time, the company was often described as being “in turmoil.” Twitter was churning through executives, and investors were concerned about lackluster user growth. Journalists and other pundits often noted that Twitter never knew <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/25/twitter-tries-to-explain-itself-again-via-a-new-marketing-campaign-aimed-at-attracting-users/">how to explain</a> what it was or why it mattered. The actual service had barely changed in years. Harassment was rampant, and relatively unchecked.</p><p>Much has changed since then. Hand-wringing over Dorsey’s two jobs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html">never really</a> abated, but turnover at the top of the company eventually slowed, and Twitter started growing again. The platform still struggles with harassment, but has made a concerted effort at encouraging “<a href="https://about.twitter.com/en/our-priorities/healthy-conversations">healthy conversations</a>” and has significantly ramped up its policies against hate speech and harassment.</p><p>More recently, the company has undertaken a number of ambitious initiatives to change its core features and create new sources of revenue. In the last year alone, Twitter has introduced new features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-section-of-app-184333909.html">live audio</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-communities-170039437.html">groups</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tip-jar-201442453.html">payments</a>. It rolled out creator-focused features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-super-follow-subscriptions-180050731.html">Super Follows</a>, and acquired a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-revue-newsletter-subscribe-button-tweets-163814091.html">newsletter platform</a> for longform content. Last month, it introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html">Twitter Blue</a>, a subscription service aimed at power users. The company is also in the early stages <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html">of BlueSky</a>, a plan to create a decentralized standard for social media platforms.</p><p>But incoming CEO Parag Agrawal will still be inheriting significant challenges alongside all the shiny new projects. Though the company has made strides in increasing conversational “health,” it’s also grappled with where to draw the line between free speech and toxicity, particularly when political figures are involved. And, like other platforms, the company struggled to rein in misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 presidential election.</p><p>“Dorsey leaves behind a mixed legacy: a platform that&#39;s useful and potent for quick communication but one that&#39;s been exploited by a range of bad actors, including former President Donald Trump, who did his best on Twitter to undermine democracy—until Dorsey&#39;s people finally had enough and shut him down,” says Paul Barrett, deputy director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, who has researched social media polarization.</p><p>That Twitter under Dorsey did eventually permanently ban Trump has only made the company more of a target for politicians. And that’s unlikely to change just because Twitter’s new CEO has been one of the company’s <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/29/twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-key-to-dorseys-plans-to-revamp-social-media.html">lowest profile</a> executives.</p><p>Agrawal is taking over as social media platforms face a bigger reckoning about their role in society. As lawmakers eye <a href="https://www.engadget.com/filter-bubble-transparency-act-house-introduction-200706847.html">regulating algorithms</a> and other reforms, Twitter has started to research <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-says-its-algorithms-amplify-the-political-right-but-it-doesnt-know-why-205859230.html">algorithmic amplification</a> and potential “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-will-study-algorithms-for-unintentional-harm-182722681.html">unintentional harms</a>” caused by its ranking systems. It will now be up to the company’s former CTO to steer that work while navigating scrutiny from lawmakers.</p><p>Agrawal will also inherit <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/twitter-sets-goals-to-double-revenue-reach-315-million-users-by-end-of-2023.html">ambitious goals</a> Twitter set earlier this year: To double its revenue and grow its user base to 315 million monetizable daily active users (mDAU) by the end of 2023 (the company reported 211 million mDAU in its most recent earnings report). And there are some signs he may be well positioned to make that happen. While Twitter under Dorsey has been slow to make decisions and release updates, Agrawal has been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/parag-agrawal-twitter.html">a proponent</a> of new features like Bitcoin tipping. He also over saw Bluesky, the decentralization project.</p><p>The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html">been betting</a> that moving away from advertising and leaning into subscription services and other new features will help it get there. But Twitter is hardly alone in pursuing creators and subscriptions, and it’s not clear the company will be able to easily persuade large swaths of users to start paying for extra content or premium features.</p><p>Twitter’s new CEO seems to be well aware of the challenges ahead. “We recently updated our strategy to hit ambitious goals, and I believe that strategy to be bold and right,” Agrawal wrote in <a href="https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1465349749607854083/photo/1">an email</a> to employees he shared on Twitter. “But our critical challenge is how we work to execute against it and deliver results.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-leaves-twitter-parag-agrawal-170029144.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">228088be-55cf-4c70-84de-43cdec4bf405</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 17:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638291486</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T16:58:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/27197130-51fc-11ec-9bbf-b150382101be" width="4992" height="3264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/27197130-51fc-11ec-9bbf-b150382101be" width="4992" height="3264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joshua Roberts / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on foreign influence operations on social media platforms on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., September 5, 2018.
