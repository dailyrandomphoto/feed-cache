On Monday, the automaker said it would build the plant on the Greensboro-Randolph Megasite, a tract of land located in Randolph County in central North Carolina. When the facility is complete sometime in 2025, it will consist of four production lines, each capable of producing batteries for 200,000 vehicles per year. Toyota plans to eventually expand the facility to produce enough power cells to support up to 1.2 million cars annually.</p><p>The plant is part of a broader <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-us-battery-investment-155141624.html"><ins>$3.4 billion investment</ins></a> the automaker has earmarked to expand its battery production capabilities in the US. When Toyota first announced the $1.29 billion facility, it said it would create approximately 1,750 jobs. The company notes it picked Greensboro-Randolph Megasite for a handful of reasons. One of the more notable ones is that it’s a location with access to renewable energy. Toyota says it’s “committed” to using 100 percent clean energy to produce batteries at the facility.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scale of the project is an acknowledgment by the automaker that it needs to diversify its electrification strategy. More so than any other automaker, Toyota invested significantly into fuel cell technology. So far, it has little to show for its efforts. Outside of California, you can’t buy its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-mirai-2021-video-130028882.html">Mirai fuel-cell sedan</a>. However, the company’s latest plan is to offer 70 different electric models, including 15 battery electric vehicles, by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-greensboro-randolph-megasite-ev-annoucement-202448241.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">550cdfed-93be-4666-87a7-1e02cd4f9d01</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 20:24:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638822292</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T20:25:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a6f12d60-56d1-11ec-bbdf-481103bc4cd6" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a6f12d60-56d1-11ec-bbdf-481103bc4cd6" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota PHEV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota PHEV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DoorDash tests 15-minute grocery deliveries in New York City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/doordash/"><ins>DoorDash</ins></a> is <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Introduces-Ultra-Fast-Grocery-Delivery-Providing-Busy-Consumers-with-a-Reliable-and-Convenient-Way-to-Restock-Instantly/default.aspx"><ins>piloting</ins></a> an ultra-fast grocery delivery service in Manhattan, with the goal of delivering items to customers in less than 15 minutes.

Dubbed <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/12/webassembly-and-back-again-fine-grained-sandboxing-in-firefox-95/"><ins>RLBox</ins></a> and available through today&#39;s Firefox 95 update, it’s a new sandboxing tool the company developed in collaboration with the University of California San Diego and the University of Texas.</p><p>All modern browsers use sandboxing to protect users against malicious code. The problem is that many of the most advanced exploits chain together two vulnerabilities to bypass those protections. With RLBox, Firefox will compile a process into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-07-mozilla-video-games-browser.html">WebAssembly</a> and then convert it into native code. According to Mozilla, this approach presents two significant advantages. It prevents code from jumping between different parts of a program and limits access to specific areas of your system’s memory.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With today’s release, Mozilla will use RLBox to isolate five components of Firefox, including the browser’s Graphite font rendering engine and Ogg multimedia module. If the system works as expected, the company says “even a zero-day vulnerability in any of [the five components] should pose no threat to Firefox.”</p><p>Mozilla is quick to note it won’t be able to use RLBox to protect every component of Firefox. For instance, it’s not suitable for modules that depend on sharing memory with the rest of the program to function. However, the company is hopeful that other developers will use the technology to make their software safer. In the meantime, RLBox is now rolling out to all desktop and mobile versions of Firefox.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-95-rlbox-190712215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eea547a2-2579-4ffe-b97a-fde0572cabaf</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 19:07:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638817636</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T19:07:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/656fe1a0-c316-11eb-bcd9-f4beb9fb4f38" width="1600" height="894" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/656fe1a0-c316-11eb-bcd9-f4beb9fb4f38" width="1600" height="894" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mozilla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Firefox]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Firefox]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube says most disputed copyright claims are resolved in the uploader's favor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/access-all-balanced-ecosystem-and-powerful-tools/">shedding more light</a> on the tidal wave of copyright claims it receives in its first copyright transparency report.

The Quick Tap to Snap feature lets Pixel 4a 5G and higher users access Snapchat directly from their lock screens by double tapping the back of the phones, to start with. Until now, the feature has only been available on the Pixel 6.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pixel 3 or newer smartphones, meanwhile, will now be able to adjust how long they hold the power button to activate Google Assistant. This feature makes it possible to avoid activating the Assistant by mistake when you&#39;re just trying to, say, turn off the phone. Another key feature for Pixel 3 (and up) owners is the Bass Slider that allows you to double the bass range available for Pixel Buds A-series earphones, now from -1 to +4.</p><p>Google is expanding car crash detection to Taiwan, Italy and France, letting you automatically send your location and details to emergency responders when a car crash is detected. It&#39;s also added the &quot;Now Playing&quot; feature that lets you detect a song and quickly add it to your favorites. Finally, Google has added new languages, including Japanese, French and German, that can be transcribed in the recorder app. All of these features are now rolling out to Pixel devices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-pixel-6-can-now-be-used-to-unlock-bmw-vehicles-180000062.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51410a4c-0596-41f6-bf3f-653247bcc9d6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638789763</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T11:22:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/670ce460-5685-11ec-bd1d-014fea2f6631" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/670ce460-5685-11ec-bd1d-014fea2f6631" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google update delivers time-saving improvements for Pixel devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google update delivers time-saving improvements for Pixel devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Xbox Windows app will make it easier to know if a game will run well on your PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many different ways to build a computer, one of the trickiest aspects of PC gaming is knowing whether a game you’re about to install will play well on your machine. Microsoft is testing a feature that could make that easier. As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22819752/xbox-windows-app-performance-check-feature"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, the Xbox app on Windows now includes a label that will tell you if a game will “play great” on your PC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/28e48cb0-56bc-11ec-9ff6-257ded1e2632" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Xbox Windows PC app" data-uuid="2041ccf5-434b-303c-98a2-b6f7441310c7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tom Warren/The Verge</div></figure><p>Since there are some titles where the app says “performance check not available yet,” it doesn’t appear Microsoft is comparing the listed system requirements against the components in your PC. Instead, it would seem the company is building a database where it tests a game against various different machines. If you want to test the labels, you can do so by downloading the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24542&amp;u1=[]vg[p]22583793[t]w[r]trello.com[d]D&amp;murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/xbox-insider-hub/9pldpg46g47z"><ins>Xbox Insider app</ins></a> and opting into the Windows gaming preview.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the system works well, it could solve a common pain point for PC gamers. In recent years, we’ve seen some developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-pc-requirements-173041076.html">share more granular system requirements</a> for their games, telling you not just the minimum and recommended spec but also hardware that will deliver the best experience at Full HD, QHD and 4K respectively. Unfortunately, there hasn’t been anything close to standardization across the industry, and that’s even before you consider the fact some developers list overly optimistic requirements for their games.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-app-pc-label-175256205.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23f87bb8-1b33-4a45-ad2d-5d0aae2624c0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 17:52:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638813179</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T17:53:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/1f5606c0-83cc-11ea-a7d1-b81a19d19a5a" width="5277" height="3576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/1f5606c0-83cc-11ea-a7d1-b81a19d19a5a" width="5277" height="3576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[La Bicicleta Vermella via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boy with headphones playing on his computer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['The Matrix Awakens' is an Unreal Engine 5 demo you can preload today]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On December 9th, Epic Games will release <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/wakeup"><em>The Matrix Awakens</em></a>, an interactive tie-in to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-trailer-131249225.html"><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em></a>.

The aircraft, which has a 54-meter wingspan with two turbofan engines, would offer the &quot;same speed and comfort as today’s aircraft&quot; but with zero carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ATI says its concept plane would have cryogenic fuel tanks in the rear fuselage, which would store hydrogen at -250 degrees Celsius (-418 degrees Farenheit). Two smaller &quot;cheek&quot; tanks along the forward fuselage would keep the plane balanced as fuel is used.</p><p>We&#39;re years away from commercial hydrogen aircraft becoming a reality, though. The refueling infrastructure doesn&#39;t exist yet and hydrogen <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/u-k-showcases-hydrogen-powered-jetliner-concept?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=tech&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;sref=10lNAhZ9">is more expensive</a> and difficult to store onboard than kerosene-based fuel. Those types of planes might not be too much of a pipe dream, however.</p><p>The ATI <a href="https://www.ati.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FlyZero-one-stop-global-connectivity-FINAL-3.12.21.pdf">expects</a> that, by the middle of the 2030s, efficient hydrogen planes might be a more economical option than current planes. That&#39;s partly because other sectors are shifting toward hydrogen, which is likely to reduce supply costs.&nbsp;</p><p>The FlyZero project plans to publish more detailed findings early next year, including concepts for regional, narrowbody and midsize aircraft, economic and market reports, roadmaps for the required tech and a sustainability assessment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hydrogen-plane-concept-flyzero-uk-aerospace-technology-institute-163107894.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f08c2eb7-69ae-4138-81e7-e4fae5f67538</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 16:31:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638808270</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T16:31:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5c89610-56af-11ec-bca4-ee390166ceb2" width="4392" height="2408" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5c89610-56af-11ec-bca4-ee390166ceb2" width="4392" height="2408" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aerospace Technology Institute]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A concept for a hydrogen-powered plane developed by the Aerospace Technology Institute's FlyZero project.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerospace Technology Institute concept for a ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Toshiba's flagship Fire TV set has hands-free Alexa]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Toshiba has launched a new flagship smart TV with built-in Fire TV just in time for the holidays.

Their interchangeable ear tips give you more control over how they fit in your ears and they&#39;re IPX4-rated, so they&#39;ll survive even your sweatiest workouts.

That means you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music on your MacBook without any hiccups. The chip also enables features like hands-free Siri access, too.</p><p>While the earbuds themselves haven&#39;t really changed since launch, the &quot;new&quot; AirPods Pro have a MagSafe case.

The company will make exceptions to its policy for some media apps in 2022.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fights-russia-app-store-ruling-205651016.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-vs-snapchat-spectacles-173247974.html"><br></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-check-out-android-12s-visual-refresh-170059195.html">ICYMI: We check out Android 12&#39;s visual refresh</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-adds-spacex-flights-due-to-boeing-starliner-delay-164503658.html">NASA will give SpaceX more crewed flights to cover for Boeing&#39;s delays</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-genesis-of-technoscientific-revolutions-narayanmurti-tsao-harvard-press-163025911.html">Hitting the Books: How the interplay of science and technology brought about iPhones</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-pulls-comedians-albums-over-royalty-dispute-180042056.html">Spotify pulls top comedians&#39; albums amid royalty dispute</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-patent-222347603.html">Clearview AI will get a US patent for its facial recognition tech</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-mail-in-service-privacy-breach-175314140.html">Google&#39;s mail-in Pixel repair service reportedly compromised photos and accounts</a></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-apple-fights-russias-app-store-ruling-121550694.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92c7d84f-a8aa-435e-99b8-11910bfec1f8</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 12:15:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638829422</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T22:23:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/172ea620-5623-11ec-af7f-b718a74dfe6d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/172ea620-5623-11ec-af7f-b718a74dfe6d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Photos 'Locked Folder' feature rolling out to non-Pixel smartphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-google-photos-gboard-other-android-devices-160039468.html">promised</a>, Google Photos is starting to roll out the Locked Folder feature to Samsung and other non-Pixel phones, <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/google-photos-locked-folder-feature-rolling-out-samsung-smartphones/"><em>Sammobile</em></a> has reported.

It then appears surprised to see the viewer or camera, and finishes the video with a smile and welcoming hand gesture.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e0d978ac71e440f2930705765ff1859b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IPukuYb9xWw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The improvements in facial animation look to be the result of more fluid movements than we&#39;ve seen before. By contrast, the Mesmer &quot;Fred&quot; robot had decent head movements, but he &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UufMROVIaU">looks like</a> he just had a shot of Novocain in his entire lower face&quot; when he speaks, I wrote back in 2018.</p><p>It appears to have a fully articulated head, face, neck, shoulders, arms and hands, but Engineered Arts notes that none of its robots can walk — though the company is studying that capability. It&#39;s not clear how Ameca&#39;s facial expressions were animated, but some form of motion capture seems a good bet. The company said that Ameca is a &quot;platform for developing AI,&quot; but is letting others develop the necessary machine learning algorithms.</p><p>Engineered Arts has previously said that it uses &quot;powerful, silent, high-torque&quot; motors to drive Mesmer&#39;s body and head movements, with everything designed from scratch to work together perfectly. It also uses sensors like cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR and microphones. To control movements, it has developed browser-based software that works much 3D apps used for VFX or gaming animation.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s no word on pricing or availability for Ameca or Mesmer, though the company&#39;s more basic RoboThespian models reportedly cost $79,000 and up in 2018. In any case, we&#39;ll soon get a close-up look at Ameca, as Engineered Arts plans to show it off at CES 2022 in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ameca-robot-shows-off-more-human-like-facial-expressions-093038139.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">82b3f0ec-1904-4e62-b954-f0a79e159bd4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 09:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638797394</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T13:29:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/dc4ce260-5663-11ec-b3d7-6d9e558ffeb3" width="1578" height="888" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/dc4ce260-5663-11ec-b3d7-6d9e558ffeb3" width="1578" height="888" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engineered Arts]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Ameca' robot shows off more human-like facial expressions]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Ameca' robot shows off more human-like facial expressions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Halo: Infinite' may have a grapple hook, but it's still a grind]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="f45b675c7c8c48909f556f5564523b75"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5TQU-IeTCRY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The best thing I can say about <em>Halo: Infinite</em> is that it gets better as it goes. The single-player campaign starts out as a basic first-person shooter dripping in nostalgia juice, and it ends up as a rudimentary open-world shooter swimming in sci-fi tropes, starring everyone&#39;s favorite emotionless space soldier and his co-dependent AI assistant.</p><p>As the first open-world entry in the Halo franchise and with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-delay-2021-193546027.html">more than a year of extra development time</a>, I had high hopes for <em>Infinite</em>. Maybe too high. And even with a grapple hook, this game just can’t reach them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I say all of this with love in my heart. I’ve been a Halo fan since <em>Combat Evolved</em>, and I have two decades of happy memories associated with the franchise, most of which I’ve re-lived while playing <em>Infinite</em>. That part has been a treat — there’s nothing like turning the corner in a random metal-lined corridor, or driving a Warthog down a narrow mountain path, and feeling that warm, gleeful sense of familiarity. This happens over and over again in <em>Infinite</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/172ea620-5623-11ec-af7f-b718a74dfe6d" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="146df28c-11a6-3b5b-92fd-1f2aaffee527"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Revamping old environments is the easy part, though. <em>Halo Infinite</em> is the first open-world entry in the franchise’s history, promising more exploration and spontaneity for Master Chief than ever before. However, in practice, the world of Zeta Halo is contained and largely linear, offering few surprises and little incentive to travel off the beaten path. There are bases to capture and hordes to defeat, but with such a cramped map, these sidequests pop up naturally along the path of the main storyline, and the game automatically switches the objective to whatever mission is nearby. Sidequests are folded into the campaign like this, and they become indistinguishable from the main missions.&nbsp;</p><p>By the time I felt ready to get out and explore the Ring, I realized I’d already hit all the icons on my map.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734e7b1-5623-11ec-bdff-74522019ccca" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="fcca5600-d43d-3904-b97a-75fd4b295236"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>That said, <em>Infinite </em>introduces new mechanics and tools that are really fun to play with, and the best of these gadgets is the grapple hook. There are no invisible walls in <em>Infinite</em>, and the grapple hook allows players to take advantage of Zeta Halo’s vertical space, scaling mountains and buildings in a series of pops and swings. The grapple hook opens up fresh vantage points for every battle, and it saved my Master Chief from falling to his death many times over. (I may have even sang, &quot;Spider-Chief, Spider-Chief...&quot; under my breath every now and then. Maybe.)</p><p>Playing with an Xbox controller, the grapple hook lives on the D-pad, alongside three other tools that get added to Chief&#39;s arsenal as the game progresses: a shield, radar darts and a dash move that I rarely use. I’ve tried to deploy the dash, but I really don’t see the point when the grapple hook does the same thing, but faster and in more directions.&nbsp;</p><p>Switching among these options on the D-pad takes some practice, but once that becomes second-nature, the hook, shield and radar make each fight more dynamic than Halo’s ever been. The grapple hook allows Master Chief to pick up objects from afar like guns and throwable explosives, it eventually shocks enemies on contact, and it lets players smoothly take over enemy vehicles. <em>Infinite </em>is at its best when it provides a rich environment for grappling, shielding and landing floaty in-air headshots, with enemies attacking from all sides.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/17349990-5623-11ec-a1ef-d15d0bcef793" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="2fccd9bb-aa93-3120-82be-dbb73f0da1a3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Now I’m going to talk some shit about the grapple hook. I know, I just sang its praises, and I stand by everything I said, but I have to put it all in context. From my perspective, the most obvious innovation in <em>Halo Infinite </em>is its use of vertical space, aided by the grapple hook — but that’s hardly a new idea at all, and frankly, other games have done it better.&nbsp;</p><p>To name just a few recent examples: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-02-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch-review.html"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a> made headlines in 2017 for rethinking vertical exploration in an open-world space; last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doom-eternal-fps-irl-133006155.html"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a> beautifully demonstrated the power of parkour mechanics in an FPS environment; and Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html">Spider-Man series</a> has perfected the art of high-swinging action. In comparison to games like these, <em>Infinite</em>’s mechanics aren’t innovative at all.</p><p>I bring this up because I think it’s a disservice to compare <em>Halo Infinite</em> only to other Halo games, rather than its competitors. After all, competition is the root of evolution — and that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-03-halo-combat-evolved-mcc-for-pc.html">kind of Halo&#39;s jam</a>. I expected more from a pioneer of the FPS genre as it ventured into open-world gaming. Just because it’s new for Halo doesn’t mean it’s new for the industry.</p><section data-eng-breakout="68c717b5f4dc4d9ab34eabb3eba51eda" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734e7b0-5623-11ec-bf56-77dedbf80bee" alt="Halo: Infinite"></section><p>Even with the fresh toys and larger world, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game. The levels are repetitive and mazelike, and the story is packed with military stereotypes, sarcastic robots, women in skin-tight bodysuits and cheesy dialogue. There are a handful of cool new weapons, like the reticle-shifting Heatwave and the revolver-like Mangler, and the entire map is generously stocked with loose ammo and guns. It’s a blockbuster action movie in interactive form, and it has high-energy, entertaining moments, but these are largely overshadowed by the simplistic grind of it all.</p><p>Overall, <em>Halo Infinite</em> lacks surprise and intrigue, from the map to individual fights. Failing a boss battle, for instance, rarely feels like a failure of strategy. These encounters generally take place in simple settings with repetitive attacks, and I don’t feel like I’m learning anything new with each runthrough; I’m just going through the motions until I catch a lucky break and I can follow the yellow diamond to my next checkpoint. And then the next. And the next.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1734c0a0-5623-11ec-bddf-a8d33063575f" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="dcacbef8-c552-3b0b-8864-578122eb25cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>All of this should make for an incredibly fun multiplayer component, and so far, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-preview-xbox-series-x-080130895.html">seems like that’s the case</a>. Maybe<em> Infinite</em>’s campaign is more engaging in split-screen co-op, historically my preferred way to play, but that mode <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-forge-delayed-183757524.html">won’t be available until next year</a>. Neither will Forge mode, for that matter.</p><p>If <em>Halo Infinite</em> had launched day-one with the Xbox Series X and S, I likely wouldn’t have many complaints. The fact that 343 Industries and Microsoft took an extra year to build this game, hyping it up the whole way through, shifted my expectations a bit. Maybe too much.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, I’ll see you in the <em>Halo: Infinite</em> multiplayer lobby on December 8th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85fb6f14-9753-4ae2-9bea-0bc0b214d114</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:01:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638797659</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T13:34:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b9c20a0-5622-11ec-bf3d-62094bf84d1e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b9c20a0-5622-11ec-bf3d-62094bf84d1e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Halo: Infinite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Fire tablets are back on sale for as low as $35]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed a chance to pick up an Amazon Fire tablet on the cheap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/most-amazon-fire-tablets-are-down-to-record-low-prices-right-now-093003172.html">during Black Friday</a>, worry not: they’re on sale again.

It has the best display of the trio thanks to a 1,920 x 1,200 resolution panel. It’s also the fastest due to the inclusion of an 2.0GHz octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM. And if all you want is something affordable, it’s hard to go wrong with the Fire 7, especially when it costs less than $50.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tablets-holiday-sale-080021175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed5f5914-36a3-43d0-847a-2058ebce4a30</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638743804</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T22:36:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/39df5b50-ab3f-11ea-ace3-4aaf1bd717c4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/39df5b50-ab3f-11ea-ace3-4aaf1bd717c4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 8 (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto exchange BitMart loses $196 million to hackers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-161726337.html">Large-scale cryptocurrency heists</a> remain a significant headache. <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/05/crypto-exchange-bitmart-hacked-with-losses-estimated-at-196-million/">According</a> to <em>Coindesk</em>, the crypto exchange BitMart <a href="https://twitter.com/sheldonbitmart/status/1467316252855226368">has lost</a> the equivalent of $196 million (originally estimated at $150 million) to a hack.

Crypto thieves aren&#39;t always that astute. The Poly Network attacker, for instance, offered to &quot;surrender&quot; and wound up returning all their loot. They claimed they were contributing to Poly&#39;s security, but that might also have been an attempt to avoid repercussions after researchers obtained potentially identifying data.</p><p>While this isn&#39;t the biggest digital heist (the Poly attacker grabbed $610 million, for instance), <em>Coindesk</em> notes this is one of the larger centralized exchange hacks to date. It also underscores the growing issue of cryptocurrency theft — the technology makes it all too feasible to steal large sums with few repercussions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/crypto-exchange-bitmart-hack-theft-222846482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2f0111bb-e368-4fb0-b729-24f926a81d0b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Dec 2021 22:28:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638743333</ingested><modified>2021-12-05T22:29:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c7469580-5610-11ec-9b7f-840c5be51660" width="4947" height="3128" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c7469580-5610-11ec-9b7f-840c5be51660" width="4947" height="3128" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Representations of cryptocurrency Ethereum are placed on PC motherboard in this illustration taken, June 29, 2021.

Both <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/05/apple-russia-app-store/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> and <a href="https://www.rt.com/business/542257-apple-takes-russia-court/"><em>RT</em></a> report Apple is asking for a judicial review of a Federal Antimonopoly Service warning from August that allows developers to mention alternatives to the App Store&#39;s in-app payment system. FAS gave Apple until September 30th to alter its policies, but the company declined to change its rules despite the threat of a fine.</p><p>The opposition parallels Apple&#39;s legal battles in the US. The judge in Epic&#39;s lawsuit against Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">ordered the tech firm</a> to let App Store developers point to other payment systems, but Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-files-appeal-app-store-injunction-101556698.html">appealed the injunction</a> in hopes of a delay. The court <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-alternative-payment-stay-injunction-062133997.html">denied Apple&#39;s request</a>, and the company will have until December 9th to let app makers point to other options.

Easier third-party alternatives could theoretically hurt App Store revenues, not to mention increase the chances of rogue apps pointing users to malicious sites. The iPhone maker might not have much choice, however.
