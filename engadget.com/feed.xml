The documentary deal hasn&#39;t been finalized, according to the site&#39;s sources, but Amazon, Arsenal and production company 72 Films all confirmed the plans.</p><p>The Gunners&#39; documentary will debut on Prime sometime after the season in 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&nbsp;Whether or not it&#39;s an exciting series is unclear. Arsenal is a legendary team, but its current roster hasn&#39;t produced top-tier results. It finished the 2020-2021 season in eighth place and bowed out of the UEFA Europa League (below the Champions League) in the semis. It does have a rising star in the form of midfielder Bukayo Saka, though, and <em>Deadline</em> pointed out that the team finished the Premier League season on a strong note. Arsenal might make for a good comeback story, then.</p><p>Amazon has diversified the scope of <em>All or Nothing</em> over the years to include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-amazon-inside-borussia-dortmund-soccer-doc.html">three soccer teams</a>, New Zealand&#39;s All Blacks rugby squad, a range of American football teams and soon a veteran hockey team (the Toronto Maple Leafs). The strategy, however, has remained the same — Amazon is determined to be a go-to source for sports shows and give you a reason to subscribe to Prime Video instead of (or alongside) rivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-15-netflix-espn-michael-jordan-documentary-series.html">like Netflix</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-arsenal-soccer-documentary-142131434.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0cba4ac1-6459-460c-9f2b-77e13790a167</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:21:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625840064</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4c1dc390-e0ba-11eb-b575-8bd4541958e6" width="4163" height="2808" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4c1dc390-e0ba-11eb-b575-8bd4541958e6" width="4163" height="2808" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[XXSTRINGERXX xxxxx / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soccer Football - Premier League - Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - March 14, 2021 Arsenal's Bukayo Saka in action with Tottenham Hotspur's Sergio Reguilon Pool via REUTERS/Dan Mullan EDITORIAL USE ONLY.

The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">just announced</a> that president Joe Biden will be signing a new executive order today that will establish a &quot;whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s targeting anticompetitive practices across a wide range of industries, including internet services and tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The order contains 72 proposals and actions, among which it specifically says &quot;the President encourages the FCC to restore Net Neutrality rules undone by the prior administration.&quot; It also asked the agency to consider limiting early termination fees and prevent internet service providers from making deals with landlords that limit tenant choices. In addition, it urged the FCC to revive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-04-fcc-consumer-broadband-labels.html">the Broadband Nutrition Label that was developed under the Obama administration</a> that would offer greater price transparency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The order also looked at how &quot;dominant tech firms are undermining competition and reducing innovation,&quot; and announced an administration policy of greater scrutiny of mergers. It would give focus on &quot;dominant internet platforms,&quot; especially around &quot;the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by “free” products, and the effect on user privacy.&quot;</p><p>As part of its crackdown on Big Tech, the order called on the Federal Trade Commission to &quot;establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of data&quot; as well as issue rules that would ban &quot;unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces&quot; and &quot;anticompetitive restrictions on using independent repair shops or doing DIY repairs of your own devices and equipment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In other industries, like banking and personal finance, the order similarly asked for more robust scrutiny of mergers. It also urged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to &quot;issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with them.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar notions of price transparency, increased scrutiny of mergers, prevention of excessive fees and consumer rights were prevalent across the other industries covered. Under agriculture, the order highlighted the need to give consumers the right to repair their tractors and equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Proposals for the healthcare sector include allowing for hearing aids to be sold over the counter, supporting price transparency rules, preventing surprise hospital billing and standardizing plan options in the National Health Insurance Marketplace for easier comparison shopping. In the transportation section, airlines were the focus of the suggestions. The order called for rules around greater transparency and disclosure over baggage, change and cancellation fees, as well as better guidelines on when a company must issue refunds over delayed baggage or non-working services (like in-flight WiFi or entertainment).</p><p>After the order is signed later today, the administration will have plenty of work to do to get these initiatives moving. It&#39;s not a guarantee that all the suggestions announced here will eventually happen, but it&#39;s a clear sign that the Biden team is paying attention to the issues of anticompetition, a lack of transparency in multiple industries and other unfair practices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e8e7528-48e5-4431-ba8b-f4b76c7b28bf</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:10:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625840991</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:30:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about the situation in Afghanistan from the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, July 8, 2021. - US President Joe Biden expressed confidence on July 8, 2021 in the Afghan military and said that a Taliban takeover of the country is not inevitable.

As cool as they could be, they always feel like an artefact from a dystopia that’s yet to engulf us. When the air burns and the seas boil, you won’t be able to fit a 40-inch HDTV into your existence-support-pod, so these will have to do. It hardly screams “aspirational.”</p><p>It doesn’t help that nobody — not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-03-sony-new-hmz-t3-head-mounted-display-wireless-hands-on.html">Sony,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-01-avegant-glyph-review.html">Avegant</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-royole-moon-personal-cinema-headset-impressions.html">Royole</a> nor <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/heroic-failures/the-man-who-invented-vr-goggles-50-years-too-soon">others</a> — has managed to make this concept work. Personal cinemas, then, have replaced VR as the go-to whenever anyone needs to talk about a product that’s perennially on the edge of breaking through, and never has. But, despite them being a solution in search of a problem, and their historical suckiness, things may be about to change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You see, TCL has been banging against this particular door for years and now, it’s gearing up to launch its first model. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-launch-140021028.html">The Nxtwear G Wearable Display Glasses</a> solve many of the problems that dogged those earlier attempts. They’re not perfect, and you’ll probably not want to buy a pair now, but this is the closest anyone has gotten to making this concept work.</p><div id="a9bcba9e8767476f800a7d785b26a510"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bF_yc0eLSfU?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>TCL’s Nxtwear G puts two tiny displays close to your eyes in order to trick you into thinking you’re looking at a bigger screen. Rather than cram the glasses full of tech, TCL put two displays, a pair of speakers and positioning hardware inside. That keeps the weight down to a very manageable 130 grams (4.5 oz), much kinder to your neck for long-term wear.</p><p>Everything else, including power, is handled by the device you plug this into, and the list of compatible hardware is pretty long. You can use major phones from Samsung, LG and OnePlus, as well as over 30 laptops and more than 25 tablets and 2-in-1s. Essentially, TCL made a plug-and-play external display for your head that should play nice with any compatible DisplayPort-equipped USB-C device.</p><p>The company decided to swim against much of the received wisdom that we’ve seen with other personal cinemas. Rather than trying to enclose the user in a black void, all the better to replicate that tenth-screen-in-a-mall-multiplex feeling, TCL wants you to see the outside world. Even when I tried the prototype, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-07-tcl-personal-cinema-visor-prototype.html?">back in 2019</a>, its representatives said that you should feel comfortable wearing this on public transport, interacting with people as you do.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1cf4ed60-df0b-11eb-befd-db9d0b00af7c" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-uuid="61c35401-9493-3109-8a77-52a2bd99c0dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>With every device I’ve tried them with, you simply need to plug the Nxtwear G in and everything starts. If you’re using a compatible TCL phone, you’ll get a pop-up asking if you want to use mirror mode, or PC mode, which sets you up inside Android’s desktop mode. The phone then acts as a touchpad for you to navigate around with your finger, although if you want to do more than hunt-and-peck, buy a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</p><p>Connecting it to my MacBook Pro, too, and the machine recognized it as an external display and I was able to work and watch TV with my primary displays turned off. In fact, I wrote a chunk of this piece while inside this thing, even if I had to turn the zoom up to mad levels to make sure everything was readable.</p><p>The Nxtwear G packs a pair of 16:9, 60Hz micro-OLED 1080p displays that the company says is the equivalent to a 140-inch screen. That requires the usual suspension of ocular disbelief but the effect works here, and the speakers do their job well enough. It’s worth saying that they are essentially blasting audio in every direction, so grab your Bluetooth headphones if, say, your partner gets really annoyed when they can hear you watching <em>Columbo</em> when you’re both in bed.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if you should expect pixel-perfect video quality from a pair of screens this tiny but be advised that they won&#39;t beat your smartphone. Certainly, HD video looks fine, but the smallness of the screens means it&#39;s really tough to see good detail. Colors were washed out, certainly compared to the footage that was playing back on the TCL 20 Pro 5G and MacBook Pro I was connected to during testing.&nbsp;</p><p>TCL’s pitch is to say that, as well as passive viewing, you can also use the glasses to work and it’s here that I think TCL may have some success. As I said, it’s possible to work with these on, and it would make sense to use them if you had to view sensitive documents. When you’re working, say, on a train, this is the perfect antidote to shoulder surfers and other drive-by snoopers. Of course, for whoever makes the inevitable joke about watching adult content with nobody noticing, have a cookie.</p><p>What TCL has managed to do is, several times over, solve the riddle as to why you could ever want to use a personal cinema. There are times and places where you could do so both for work (more or less) and play (in some circumstances). Unfortunately, while the company was making great strides to solve the technical issues, it didn’t have a huge amount of time to devote to making this experience comfortable.</p><p>Your mileage may vary, but I found using these glasses to be a delightful experience right up until the moment it became painful. It is, right now, impossible to use these for a prolonged period of time before something starts hurting, either inside or outside your skull.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0093a0e0-df1e-11eb-ba7c-a3a057e49455" alt="Image from inside" data-uuid="98ca7e5a-01bd-357b-80c5-a04f7c0b5831"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One of the more problematic design decisions that TCL took was to include a trio of nose pads that push the screen up and higher. The idea is to keep the screens in line with your eyes, but the unfortunate result is that you need to put the nose pads way down your nose. Like, to the point where you feel like, no matter the size, it feels like you’re wearing those wire grips to close your nostrils that professional swimmers wear during sporting events.</p><p>Then there’re the Temple Tips, the part of the glasses arms which bend down to hook over your ears. Whereas with regular glasses those tips are semi-plastic and can be adjusted by an optician (or at home, with a hairdryer and some guile), the Nxtwear G’s arms are rigid. Prolonged periods of wear mean that you’ll get two slices of hard plastic sticking into the soft fleshy bit of your head behind your ears.</p><p>The solution I found to alleviate both of those issues, at least for a bit, was to pull out the nose pads entirely and wear them as I would regular glasses. After all, as a seasoned specs wearer, I accepted that the experience might not be as good — but found that this was actually better. I got a full view of the screen and it was significantly more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. But, unfortunately, the reason the nose pads stand the glasses off your schnozz is to avoid it getting warm, since the Nxtwear G does generate a decent amount of warmth (not heat, <em>warmth</em>, mind you).</p><p>And then, finally, there’s the issue of eye strain which, no matter how I wore these things, still meant I had to give up for significant rest periods. Maybe, it’s because I’m short-sighted, and so my eyes are already weak and feeble compared to the average personal cinema enjoyer. But I doubt it, and suspect that lots of people may run the risk of an eye-strain headache if they use this for too long at once.</p><p>Now, I bet you’re thinking ‘gee, if these were priced like an accessory, I’d grab a pair just to see what the fuss is about.’ I don’t blame TCL for needing to recoup some of the development costs for these things, but <em>boy</em>. These glasses are going on sale in Oz for $899 AUS, which is the better part of $700 in the US. Heck, you can buy TCL’s new 20 Pro 5G for $500 and just hold it near to your face and pat yourself on the back for your thriftiness.</p><p>Facetiousness aside, I think TCL deserves enormous credit for making what can only be described as the best wearable display ever made. And if you’re able, I’d say you should go and try these out, because my comfort-related dealbreakers may not affect you. And TCL deserves a fair crack at making these things cheaper and a little less prone to pinching, because we’re so damn close. Sincerely, if personal cinemas are going to become a success, it’ll be because it follows the template that TCL has laid down. It just needs a few tweaks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-140057578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9720e18-ebf4-4cd4-af3c-5446ec231f12</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625836988</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T13:23:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of TCL's first wearable display.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Nxtwear Glasses]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New York City launches a cyberdefense center in Manhattan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-jbs-payment-032554207.html">Infrastructure cyberattacks</a> are quickly becoming a significant problem in the US, and New York City is opening a facility that could help fend off those potentially dangerous hacks.

wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As studios and streaming services continue to strike deals, jump ship and generally settle with preferred partners, it’s getting harder to figure out which movies will be available where — and when. Amazon’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html"> latest deal with Universal</a> is case in point.</p><p>Amazon has struck a multi-year deal for exclusive Prime Video streaming rights for Universal&#39;s live-action theatrical releases, which will kick in next year. According to a report from <em>Deadline</em>, it will cover blockbusters such as J<em>urassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out</em> director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p><p>However, the deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Just days ago, Universal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">struck an agreement with its NBCUniversal sibling, Peacock</a>, for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><p>So, that should mean that within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for a 10-month run, before going back to Peacock for at least another four months.</p><p>Universal’s plan seems to be shuffling the release schedule around different streaming platforms to ensure its movies get to more audiences across different services — while keeping said platforms satisfied with what they get. The trouble is you might struggle to find the film you want to watch — or miss the chance to see it — unless you’re paying a lot of attention to movie release dates.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm and ASUS made a phone for Snapdragon Insiders</a></h2><h3>An expensive phone for spec die-hards.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" style="height:1152;width:2048;" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="4b7b5ecc-33c8-32ed-8f98-144818e9d107"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure></a><p>ASUS and Qualcomm have teamed up to make a smartphone that shows off some of the latter&#39;s mobile tech. Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program, it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>Oddly, it won’t pack the very highest-end Qualcomm mobile processor (Snapdragon 888+), but a Snapdragon 888 5G chipset, with what’s described as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E. There’s also 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p><p>The screen, too, is specced out: It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and up to 1,200 nits of brightness. The rear 64-megapixel camera will also be capable of recording 8K video.</p><p>It’ll be one of the first phones to support Snapdragon Sound, which features low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz. Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds, which is a nice touch. The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It will cost a heady $1,499 when it arrives later this summer. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Harley-Davidson&#39;s latest LiveWire electric motorcycle is a more affordable ride</a></h2><h3>The first electric motorcycle from the company&#39;s LiveWire brand is here.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9ea3d380-e00f-11eb-aede-c48e63b59d01" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="LiveWire One" data-uuid="75372d5a-89ef-3c96-a597-f8160d0ff700"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harley-Davidson</div></figure></a><p>The most eye-catching feature of Harley-Davidson’s new LiveWire One is its price tag. The electric motorcycle will cost $21,999. That’s almost $8,000 less than the $29,799 the original LiveWire sold for when it came out in 2019. With federal subsidies, Harley-Davidson expects most US buyers will be able to get the LiveWire One for less than $20,000.</p><p>Harley-Davidson has also improved the motorcycle’s range. Driving on slower city streets, the LiveWire One can travel 146 miles on a single charge, the company claims. By comparison, its predecessor was limited to a maximum of about 110 city miles. Using a DC fast charger, the company says you can get the LiveWire One’s battery from dead to a full charge in about an hour.</p><p>The second electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson will initially be limited to customers who live in California, New York and Texas since only 12 dealerships in those states are authorized to sell the LiveWire One at the moment. However, the bike will be available at more dealers come this fall. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-033027788.html">Square will build a bitcoin hardware wallet</a></h2><h3>But it&#39;s still early days for the project.</h3><h3></h3><p>Square is building a bitcoin hardware wallet and service, a month after company CEO Jack Dorsey announced it&#39;s considering the move.

While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faze-clan-suspends-crypto-scheme-players-221223343.html">crypto scams</a> have been getting <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-investment-scams/">increasingly common</a>, Swedish citizen Roger Nils-Jonas Karlsson defrauded thousands of victims and stole tens of millions of dollars over a period that lasted almost a decade. He pleaded guilty to securities and wire fraud, as well as money laundering charges on March 4th.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Department of Justice, Karlsson ran his fraudulent investment scheme from 2011 until he was arrested in Thailand in 2019. He targeted financially insecure individuals, such as seniors, persuading them to use cryptocurrency to purchase shares in a business he called &quot;Eastern Metal Securities.&quot; Based on information from court documents, he promised victims huge payouts tied to the price of gold, but the money they handed over wasn&#39;t invested at all. It was moved to Karlsson&#39;s personal bank accounts instead and used to purchase expensive homes and even resorts in Thailand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To keep his scheme running for almost a decade, he&#39;d rebrand and would show victims account statements in an effort to convince them that their funds are secure. Karlsson would then give them various excuses for payout delays and even falsely claimed to be working with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the sentencing, US District Judge Charles R. Breyer ordered his Thai resorts and accounts to be forfeited. He was also ordered to pay his victims in the amount of $16,263,820.</p><p>Acting US Attorney Stephanie Hinds of the Northern District of California said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The investigation into Roger Karlsson’s fraud uncovered a frighteningly callous scheme that lasted more than a decade during which Karlsson targeted thousands of victims, including financially vulnerable seniors, to callously rob them of their assets and all to fuel an extravagant lifestyle surrounded by luxury condominiums and lavish international vacations. The court&#39;s decision to order a 180-month prison term reflects the fact that Karlsson’s cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme is one of the largest to be sentenced to date and ensures that Karlsson now will have plenty of time to think about the harm he has caused to his victims.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/crypto-ponzi-scam-roger-nils-jonas-karlsson-doj-071142854.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1c2d4cee-9b5a-4e9b-81fc-36ca153997ee</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 07:11:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625814705</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T07:12:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/14893bf0-33d9-11eb-bf78-689d4ffd327a" width="6200" height="3200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/14893bf0-33d9-11eb-bf78-689d4ffd327a" width="6200" height="3200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[peterschreiber.media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bitcoin Symbol in a digital raster microstructure - 3d illustration]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Digitized Bitcoin Symbol]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Square will build a bitcoin hardware wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Square has decided to go ahead with building a bitcoin hardware wallet and service, a month after company CEO Jack Dorsey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-173032873.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s considering the move.

In its decision, the board questioned Facebook’s internal policies and said the company should be more transparent about whether other key policies may have been “lost.”</p><p>The underlying case stems from an Instagram post about Abdullah Öcalan, in which the poster “encouraged readers to engage in conversation about Öcalan’s imprisonment and the inhumane nature of solitary confinement.” (As the board notes, Öcalan is a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Facebook has officially designated as a “dangerous organization.”)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook had initially removed the post, as Facebook users are barred from praising or showing support for dangerous organizations or individuals. However, Facebook also had “internal guidance” — created partially as a result of discussions around Öcalan’s imprisonment — that “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But that rule was not applied, even after the user’s initial appeal. Facebook told the board it had  “inadvertently not transferred” that part of its policy when it moved to a new review system in 2018.</p><p>Though Facebook had already admitted the error and reinstated the post, the board said it was “concerned” with how the case had been handled, and that “an important policy exception” had effectively fallen through the cracks for three years.</p><p>“The Board is concerned that Facebook lost specific guidance on an important policy exception for three years,” the group wrote. “Facebook’s policy of defaulting towards removing content showing ‘support’ for designated individuals, while keeping key exceptions hidden from the public, allowed this mistake to go unnoticed for an extended period. Facebook only learned that this policy was not being applied because of the user who decided to appeal the company’s decision to the Board.”</p><p>The board also chastised Facebook for not being transparent about how many other users may have been affected by the same issue. Facebook told the board it wasn’t “technically feasible” to determine how many other posts may have been mistakenly taken down. “Facebook’s actions in this case indicate that the company is failing to respect the right to remedy, contravening its Corporate Human Rights Policy,” the board said.</p><p>The case highlights how Facebook’s complex rules are often shaped by guidance that users can’t see, and how the Oversight Board has repeatedly challenged the company to make all its policies more clear to users.</p><p>Though it’s only taken up a handful of cases so far, the Oversight Board has repeatedly criticized Facebook for not following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>its own rules</ins></a>. “They can&#39;t just invent new unwritten rules when it suits them,” board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt told reporters after they said Facebook was wrong to impose an “indefinite” suspension on Donald Trump. The board has also criticized Facebook for not alerting users to key parts of its policies, such as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html"><ins>“satire exception.”</ins></a> It’s pushed the company to clarify its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> policies, and how it treats speech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>from politicians</ins></a> and other high-profile figures.</p><p>Facebook has 30 days to respond to the Oversight Board in this case, including several recommendations that it further clarify its “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations” policy and update its transparency reporting process.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-lost-rule-193222133.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5a236e6-3cfe-44a3-8d4f-a802a97e2127</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 19:32:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625772773</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T19:33:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

As <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/amazon-prime-video-imdb-tv-universal-licensing-deal-1234788103/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports, it&#39;s the first time Amazon has made such an agreement with a major US studio. The deal kicks in with Universal&#39;s 2022 slate of movies.</p><p>Here&#39;s where things might get a little confusing. The deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Earlier this week, Universal and its NBCUniversal sibling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/peacock">Peacock</a> reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">a similar agreement</a> for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for 10 months, then the films will go back to Peacock for at least another four months. Streaming rights can get pretty complicated!</p><p>The deal covers blockbusters such as <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out </em>director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>. Movies from Focus Features and Blumhouse are also part of the pact.</p><p>Netflix currently streams Universal&#39;s animated movies from Illumination and DreamWorks. According to <em>Deadline, </em>from next year onwards, Netflix might still stream the studio&#39;s animated releases for the 10 months of the pay-one window that they&#39;re not on Peacock. In any case, those films will hit Prime Video at a later date. Phew.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#39;s free streaming service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/imdb%20tv">IMDb TV</a> will hold exclusive streaming rights for 2020 and 2021 theatrical movies from Universal. The deal covers <em>The Invisible Man </em>and current box office champ <em>F9, </em>along with some older animated movies like <em>Despicable Me 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2</em> and <em>Shrek 2</em>.</p><p>The Prime Video deal follows a major agreement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-netflix-exclusive-deal-182221930.html">between Netflix and Sony Pictures</a>. Starting in 2022, Netflix will have exclusive rights to Sony&#39;s theatrical releases for the 18-month pay-one window. So, movies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-delayed-again-again-024721336.html"><em>Uncharted</em></a>, the <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> sequel and <em>Morbius </em>are all Netflix-bound.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1b8c4a75-370a-4272-a566-bf9a0133e977</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625769679</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T18:41:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LISA O'CONNOR via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Universal Studios globe fountain is pictured as season pass holders attend to the opening day in Los Angeles, California, on April 15, 2021. - Universal Studios Hollywood will reopen on April 16 following more than a year of closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The site says that the project, which will take between six and eight months to finish, will be formatted in 4K, with Dolby Vision HDR and a new Dolby Atmos soundtrack. David C. Fein, Mike Matessino and Daren R. Dochterman, who worked with Wise on the 2001 DVD version, will all return to work on the 4K spruce up.</p><p><em>The Motion Picture</em> (<em>TMP</em>)’s fraught production meant that the film was barely finished before it premiered, with Wise carrying the print himself to the premiere. Wise had said that the film was “unfinished,” and despite a healthy box office, took a pasting from critics who deemed it to be too slow and talky. At the dawn of the DVD era, Wise, Fein, Matessino and Dochterman collaborated on a re-edit of the film that better showed off Wise’s original vision. This included remastered visual effects and a remastered and re-edited score by Jerry Goldsmith. The effects for the 2001 version were produced by CGI pioneers Foundation Imaging, which was Star Trek’s (then) contractor for all computer generated work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="79819b7fd7064a83ae3367637e916e2a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbgqsaBZHUQ?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>(After its theatrical run, ABC broadcast a “Special Longer Version” of the film that is notorious for including extra scenes with clearly unfinished effects.

Fein confirmed in 2017 that the digital material necessary to facilitate a 4K remastering still exists.</p><p>Given how<em> TMP’s</em> reputation has been slowly rehabilitated over the last three decades, a 4K version of the film is very welcome. If only because, as well as a smart and interesting vision of the future, the model work and score are so good that they deserve to be seen in the best possible resolution. We can’t wait to experience this in 4K when it arrives at some point between December and next March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-motion-picture-directors-edition-4k-remaster-paramount-plus-154117182.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">235684c6-b85f-4927-b7d2-75661fcbf293</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:41:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625758917</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T15:42:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DECEMBER 7:  Actors Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and William Shatner pose for a portrait with writer Gene Roddenberry and  director Robert Wise during the filming of the movie "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" which was released December 27, 1979 in the United States.

Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program (which is a bit like Microsoft&#39;s Windows Insider early-access scheme), it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>The snappily named Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders harnesses Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888 5G chipset</a> (but not the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a>). It has a 2.84 GHz octa-core processor and the Adreno 660 GPU. It has what Qualcomm describes as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E support with speeds of up to 3.6 Gbps. You&#39;ll get 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and 512GB of storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 6.78-inch AMOLED display from Samsung has a 144 Hz refresh rate, which could help make it a solid gaming phone. The screen has up to 1,200 nits of brightness and it&#39;s HDR10 and HDR10+ certified. The phone has three rear cameras: a 64MP main lens, 12MP ultrawide camera and 8MP telephoto. The array can capture video in up to 8K. The device also has a 24MP front camera and AI auto-zoom.</p><p>Qualcomm says this is one of the first phones to support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-wireless-audio-quality-160036734.html">Snapdragon Sound</a>, which has features including low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz. Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds and a charging case for them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96deec00-df58-11eb-a7e2-a4745dcb8aa8" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="56dfe2ba-28f9-3103-8794-86ec75b4175d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure><p>There&#39;s also Qualcomm Quick Charge 5 support, which should charge the 4000mAh battery up to 70 percent of capacity in half an hour or fully in 52 minutes, according to the company. In addition, the phone has dual SIM slots and it runs on stock <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2011">Android 11</a>.</p><p>The device draws from previous ASUS smartphones. It pulls from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG Phone 5&#39;s body design</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenfone-8-compact-flagship-flip-camera-price-availability-182205867.html">ZenFone 8 Flip&#39;s camera module</a>. Still, it&#39;s a showcase for Qualcomm&#39;s mobile tech. The company is facing some challenges on the mobile processor front, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-5g-iphone-chips-2023-kuo-080605379.html">many phone makers</a> working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">their own chips</a>. Showing off its knowhow with its own smartphone seems like a solid idea for Qualcomm. That way, it can perhaps remind people what it can do.</p><p>The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It&#39;ll arrive in India later. You&#39;ll be able to buy the $1,499 device at ASUSTeK’s eShop and other retailers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d079e9f-9ac1-4f23-a299-1ab2d2a46a68</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625763024</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T16:50:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
