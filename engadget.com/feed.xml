A lot has changed in four years, if not as much as you might think — this is as much about dragging the device into the modern era as anything.</p><p>The Nook GlowLight 4 is billed as &quot;sleeker&quot; than the GlowLight 3, with a smaller overall profile, better page-turning buttons and a more comfortable hand feel. It&#39;s the first Nook e-reader with USB-C, and storage has quadrupled to 32GB. However, you&#39;ll still see a 6-inch, 300DPI e-paper display and a claimed one-month battery life. This is more for Nook newcomers, or those upgrading from particularly old devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The GlowLight 4 ships December 8th for $150. That could make it a tough sell against the 6.8-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html">Kindle Paperwhite</a>, the water-friendly Kobo Libra 2 and other mid-tier e-readers. It&#39;s a viable alternative if you don&#39;t want to attach yourself to the Amazon or Kobo ecosystems, though. Also, this is as much a declaration of intent as a new product. Barnes &amp; Noble chief James Daunt said the company planned to &quot;reinvigorate&quot; the Nook line in the months and years ahead — this may just be one of the opening salvos.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/barnes-and-noble-nook-glowlight-4-e-reader-191526217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b3b9ac6-9be3-496d-ae1a-03674e4d0b2f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:15:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638384280</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T18:44:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0141e10-52cf-11ec-bfe9-1978834475e4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0141e10-52cf-11ec-bfe9-1978834475e4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight 4 e-reader]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight 4 e-reader]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[CVS Pharmacy now offers audio prescription labels across the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a trial in 2020 involving 1,700 locations across the US, CVS is <a href="https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/spoken-rx-talking-prescription-labels-now-available-in-all-cvs"><ins>expanding the availability of its Spoken Rx</ins></a> audio prescription labels to all 10,000 of its pharmacies nationwide.

And we say it doesn&#39;t work, we mean it&#39;s almost entirely broken. Most people report they can&#39;t run any of the software they&#39;ve downloaded from Amazon. Yet others say they don&#39;t see any apps when they visit the marketplace. An Amazon forum post spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811710/amazon-android-12-appstore-drm-issues"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>succinctly captures the situation many Appstore users find themselves in after installing Android 12.</p><p>&quot;My rain radar app from the Amazon Appstore is still happily running and giving me alerts via notifications, but I can&#39;t actually see them because it is being prevented from running full screen by the Amazon Appstore&#39;s failure to run properly,&quot; said forum user Lovingboth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon has yet to say when it plans to fix the problem. The company only added a notice to the top of the Appstore about the Android 12 issues earlier this week. &quot;We&#39;re excited about Android 12 too,&quot; the notification says. &quot;Unfortunately we&#39;re working through some issues. Thank you for your patience as we get your Appstore back.&quot;</p><p>As <a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/11/android-12-launched-a-month-ago-and-amazon-appstore-still-wont-run-on-it.html"><em><ins>Liliputing</ins></em></a> points out, the Appstore&#39;s problems with Android 12 likely stem from incompatibility between Amazon&#39;s built-in DRM and Google&#39;s new operating system. &quot;We are aware and working to resolve an issue impacting app performance and launches for the small number of Amazon Appstore users that have upgraded to Android 12 on their mobile devices,&quot; an Amazon spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>. &quot;This issue does not impact Amazon Fire Tablets or Fire TV devices.&quot;</p><p>With Android 12 only available on a handful of devices and most using the Play Store to download their apps, it&#39;s not a problem that affects many people. Still, it&#39;s one that&#39;s poised to become more widespread as the update rolls out to more devices, particularly if Amazon doesn&#39;t work quickly to resolve it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-app-store-broken-android-12-173131316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bcce597-ce9b-444b-9080-0caace33cbd0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:31:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638379850</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T17:30:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/abf05ad0-52ca-11ec-be3b-905bedf8abbe" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/abf05ad0-52ca-11ec-be3b-905bedf8abbe" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's $9,000 drone for its Alpha cameras is available for pre-order]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months later than originally planned, <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/sony"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has <a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-airpeak-s1-professional-drone-now-available-to-order">opened</a> pre-orders for its first drone for professionals.

Starting today, the digital car key function that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-key-183057490.html"><ins>announced at Google I/O</ins></a> in May is available on Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 for compatible BMW vehicles in select countries. You can use your phone to lock and unlock the doors, and start the engine. The feature is likely coming to other vehicles later — Google has been working with other, unnamed automakers on support for digital car keys.</p><p>There&#39;s now an option to open <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%20auto/"><ins>Android Auto</ins></a> automatically when you connect your device to a compatible car. In addition, the home screen will have an always-on play button, so you can fire up your favorite music with a single tap.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Smart reply options (which will arrive in the coming months) will offer more ways to respond to text messages while you&#39;re driving. You can tap to reply or create a custom message with the help of Google Assistant. Also coming soon, there&#39;ll be a faster way to search for music in your media apps. Just tap the search button and say the name of your favorite artist or song.</p><p>Other media-centric options are coming to the home screen of Android 12 proper. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube%20music/"><ins>YouTube Music</ins></a> widget, for instance, includes playback controls and recently played songs. Two other widgets are rolling out next week. One for Google Play Books offers access to your library of books and could help you keep track of where you are in audiobooks.</p><div id="315b3824a81e436d8fd10bf02faccb34"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hp-lGxwPUnI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A Google Photos People &amp; Pets widget, meanwhile, provides an easy way to bring your loved ones to the home screen. Select a few faces and a frame, and your family, friends and pets can take pride of place on the home screen.</p><p>Elsewhere in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20photos/"><ins>Google Photos</ins></a>, you&#39;ll start to see Memories in the photo grid. It&#39;s a curated selection of photos and videos from holidays and events like birthdays and graduations, which are displayed in a stories format. Along with renaming, personalizing and correcting them, you&#39;ll have the option to remove Memories from the grid.</p><div id="897573efa662474f80216840f63abc78"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CiQEfiZv9s?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Google is bringing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-family-bell-smart-speaker-display-150006076.html"><ins>Family Bell</ins></a> from smart home products to mobile devices. You can set up the feature to alert you and your family with bells and notifications when it&#39;s time to do certain things, such as picking up kids from school or getting to bed at a decent hour. Family members can set or customize as many bells as they like on their own devices to keep stay on schedule. Google will offer suggested bells too, including holiday-themed ones like volunteering for a local cause or watering the tree.</p><p>In Gboard&#39;s Emoji Kitchen, you&#39;ll see thousands more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html"><ins>emoji mashups</ins></a>. They&#39;ll be available for Gboard Beta users starting today and for everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Last, but not least, Google announced another Android security measure. To help protect your privacy, your device will automatically turn off runtime permissions (which allow apps to access data or carry out actions for you) in apps you haven&#39;t used in a while. You can turn these permissions back on in the app or the device settings. The feature will be available on Android 12 at first. Starting next month, Google plans to roll it out to devices with Google Play services running Android 6.0 or later.</p><div id="f25b59b5996c40c6826921bec94efca9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKqSayojRkg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-keys-assistant-widgets-photos-youtube-music-170006763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e177addb-cd0c-43c7-8d13-cabf4842388f</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638373708</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T15:48:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration showing a selection of new Android 12 features.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon and Bang & Olufsen made soundbars with Android TV built-in]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent company) isn&#39;t just relying on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-verizon-stream-tv.html">no-frills media players</a> to push its Stream TV platform.

Step up to the $1,000 Soundbar Pro and you&#39;ll get nine B&amp;O speakers, a third HDMI port and a B&amp;O-designed profile.

But, in 2021, companies like Microsoft, Apple and Google continued to improve their operating systems for machines that do double duty. Windows 11 has features that make it friendlier for multi-screen devices, while Android 12L is on the horizon and promises an optimized experience for larger displays. Plus, with the rise of ARM-based chips for laptops, especially Apple’s impressive M1 series, prospects for a powerful 2-in-1 with a vast touch-friendly app ecosystem is at an all-time high.</p><p>These machines still have their limits, of course. Since they’re smaller than proper laptops, they tend to have less-powerful processors. Keyboards also tend to be less sturdy, with condensed layouts and shallower key travel. Plus, they’re almost always tablets first, leaving you to buy a keyboard case separately. (And those ain’t cheap.) So, you can’t always assume the advertised price is what you’ll actually spend on the 2-in-1 you want.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sometimes, getting a third-party keyboard might be just as good, and they’re often cheaper than first-party offerings. If you’re looking to save some money, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Slim Folio" href="https://amzn.to/2K0q2DT">Logitech’s Slim Folio</a> is a cheaper option, and if you don’t need your keyboard to attach to your tablet, Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3eYAHe0">K780 Multi-Device wireless keyboard</a> is also a good pick.</p><p>While we’ve typically made sure to include a budget 2-in-1 in previous years, this time there isn’t a great choice. We would usually go with a Surface Go, but the 2021 model is too expensive. Other alternatives, like cheaper Android tablets, are underpowered and don’t offer a great multitasking interface. If you want something around $500 that’s thin, lightweight and long-lasting, you’re better off this year looking at a conventional laptop (like those on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-affordable-windows-laptops-123000512.html">our best budget PCs list</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c7370210-25c8-11eb-bfef-f2bf92a9b702" alt="Apple iPad Pro 12.9 2020"><figcaption>Chris Velazco / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>When you’re shopping for a 2-in-1, there are some basic criteria to keep in mind. First, look at the spec sheet to see how heavy the tablet is (alone, and with the keyboard). Most modern hybrids weigh less than 2 pounds, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">the 1.96-pound Surface Pro 8</a> being one of the heaviest around. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad Pro 12.9 (2021)</a> and Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S7+ are both slightly lighter. If the overall weight of the tablet and its keyboard come close to 3 pounds, you’ll be better off just getting an ultraportable laptop.</p><p>You’ll also want to opt for an 11-inch or 12-inch screen instead of a smaller 10-inch model. The bigger displays will make multitasking easier, plus their companion keyboards will be much better spaced. Also, try to get 6GB of RAM if you can for better performance — you’ll find this in the base model of the Galaxy Tab S7+, while this year’s iPad Pro and the Surface Pro 8 start with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Finally, while some 2-in-1s offer built-in LTE or 5G connectivity, not everyone will want to pay the premium for it. An integrated cellular radio makes checking emails or replying to messages on the go far more convenient. But it also often costs more, and that’s not counting what you’ll pay for data. And, as for 5G — you can hold off on it unless you live within range of a mmWave beacon. Coverage is still spotty and existing nationwide networks use the slower sub-6 technology that’s barely faster than LTE.&nbsp;</p><h2>Engadget Picks</h2><h2>Best overall: Surface Pro 8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/088f94b0-2533-11ec-b9a3-0ab15069c542" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Pro 8 and Signature Pro Keyboard accessory." data-uuid="27319964-9d1e-3c8f-8e95-daa497cb8401"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dana Wollman/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no beating the Surface series when it comes to 2-in-1s. They’re powerful, sleek tablets running an OS that’s actually designed for productivity. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro 8" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm">Surface Pro 8</a> is Microsoft’s latest and it addresses most of the issues we had with its predecessor. It’s thinner and looks more modern, borrowing the design of last year’s Pro X. Plus, it has a 120Hz display that makes scrolling endless spreadsheets or emails feel much faster. Just remember to drop the refresh rate to 60Hz if you want to get respectable battery life out of this thing. Windows 11 also offers a better split-screen experience for on-the-go multitasking.</p><p>Like most of the other 2-in-1s on this list, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">Pro 8</a> doesn’t come with a keyboard cover — you’ll have to pay extra for that. That’s a shame, considering it starts at $1,099. Microsoft offers a variety of Type Covers for its Surface Pros ranging from $100 to $180, depending on whether you want a slot for a stylus on it. But at least they’re comfortable and well-spaced. You can also get the Surface Slim Pen 2 ($130) for sketching out your diagrams or artwork, and it also features haptic feedback for a more responsive experience.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3l68zdm" id="c2e258171d43476ba6c01350018b5e56" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Surface Pro 8 at Microsoft starting at $1,099</a><h2>Best for Apple users: 12.9-inch iPad Pro (2021)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/6c1a9ec0-b815-11eb-8b33-87fbb637229f" style="height:1542;width:3000;" alt="Apple iPad Pro (2021) review" data-uuid="9ab5c248-d237-3cd3-9d5c-a973b9bcf0da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem, the best option for you is obviously an iPad. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:12-inch Pro" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9">12-inch Pro</a> is our pick. Like older models, this iPad Pro has a stunning 12.9-inch screen with a speedy 120Hz refresh rate, but this year it uses mini-LED backlighting to deliver greater dynamic range. Apple’s M1 chipset is impressively fast too, and more than good enough for most tasks. Plus, the latest iPadOS is superior to older versions thanks to widgets and quick notes support.</p><p>Apple’s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Magic Keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3HpetiZ">Magic Keyboard</a> provides a satisfying typing experience, and its trackpad means you won’t have to reach for the screen to launch apps. But it’ll also cost you an extra $300, making it the most expensive case on this list by a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad</a> also lacks a headphone jack and its webcam is awkwardly positioned along the left bezel when you prop it up horizontally, so be aware that it’s still far from a perfect laptop replacement. Still, with its sleek design and respectable battery life, the iPad Pro 12.9 is a good 2-in-1 for Apple users.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/329dfs9" id="f16fcb2f983c407eb02d3247a2abe4f4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 12.9-inch iPad Pro at Amazon - $1,099</a><h2>Best for Android users: Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/7db721a0-25c9-11eb-be9f-3d20d2583a4c" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S7+"><figcaption>Cherlynn Low / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>While Windows is better than iPadOS and Android for productivity, it lags the other two when it comes to apps specifically designed for touchscreens.

You might find some other smart conveniences on higher-end models, but &quot;less is more&quot; has usually been the way. <a href="https://newurtopia.com/pages/carbon-ebike">Urtopia</a>, the latest e-bike brand from China, has other ideas. Its debut ride is, on paper, one of the most tech-heavy bikes we’ve seen. The spec sheet reads more like a phone’s than a next-gen fixie.</p><p>For example, beyond the 250W hub motor with three levels of riding assist (and an estimated 30-80 mile range), there’s an integrated dot-matrix display, a fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G (via eSIM), mmWave sensors for vehicle detection, an integrated alarm and, well… the list goes on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bike itself has a striking aesthetic that doesn’t bother to hide the fact that this is possibly the most technologically advanced model you’ll see this year. The frame was designed by Mathis Heller who has experience with BMW and IKEA among others, and it’s pure curves and racing lines. The stealth bomber look is further enhanced with all the cables hidden from view inside the frame. The Urtopia is pitched as a city bike and while the (removable) battery isn’t overly obvious, there’s no doubt to even the most casual of glances that you’re not wielding a regular analog pedaller.</p><p>When this thing arrived, I was dreading putting it together. Previous experience has taught me that while not complex, you’ll want to set aside some time (and space) to get things set up. Turns out, the prototype model I tested only really needed the front wheel inserted and the tires pumped and I was good to go.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/780bc4b0-51f4-11ec-abbd-076651e3d916" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="c91cbd19-8f23-3cec-874a-16a5b7db518e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The obvious draw here for gadget fans will be the “smartbar” — an onboard computer built right into the handlebars. The dot matrix display is the centerpiece of the bike and only dials up that “bike from the future” vibe. On the right-hand side where the bell would usually be is the fingerprint reader which interacts with the computer in a few ways (it’s also a digital bell). The left-hand side houses the four-way D-pad which is where you change modes and settings along with powering the bike on (but not off, more on that later).</p><p>Despite that long list of smart features, not all of them were available to test on the prototype I was sent. The hardware for the mmWave sensors is there, but there’s no way to activate it. The GPS and eSIM require the companion app to work and that’s not ready yet also. Sadly, those are some very interesting features we’ll have to wait and see on, but most everything else was present and correct.</p><p>Before the fun stuff, the basic e-bike functionality (power/speeds/range etc.) appears to be on par with other hub-motor bikes I’ve tried. For example, I recently tested the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html">Tenways city bike</a>, which has a 250W battery and motor compared to the Urtopia’s 360Wh cell. But both have 250W torque-based brushless hub motors and the same Gates carbon belt.</p><p>Things get more exciting once you turn the bike on. You’ll be greeted with a wooshing sound from the speaker in the smartbar and the company logo appearing on the display before defaulting back to the speedometer. I am informed that some of the sounds will be user-configurable and I hope that includes the option to turn them off. Before you ride, you’ll want to familiarize yourself with the controls. Up and down on the D-pad will cycle through the assistance levels: Pedal mode, Eco, Comfort and Sport (there’s also a “Turbo” mode which is akin to a “throttle” mode).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cb91c1c0-51f4-11ec-b7a5-e507c68cec56" alt="Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground." data-uuid="85d2b99f-3f8d-3165-9e20-59572f950dbc"><figcaption>Urtopia e-bike projects turn signals onto the ground.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Tap left or right, and you’ll be presented with turn signals projected on the ground (these also remain on when the lights are on but flash when you initiate a turn). To switch the actual lights on, however, involves speaking to the bike — there’s no manual control, only voice.</p><p>This is where things get a little goofy. Urtopia warns in its press materials that the voice recognition system hasn’t been fully “trained.” Yet, for me, it worked perfectly. Perhaps they only trained it on dull-voiced Britons? Anyway, to turn the lights on you’ll need to place a digit on the fingerprint reader and wait for the face icon to appear on the screen letting you know you can issue your command like some sort of Belgian Michael Knight. It’s cool but I’d still like a physical switch so that I don’t have to talk to my bike in public, not least because when you’re riding, it’s harder for the smartbar to hear your voice thanks to the rustling wind, etc. The result is you either have to stop for a second or lean into the handlebars as you go, neither is very elegant.</p><p>The list of things you can currently control with your voice includes: Change speed mode, lock the bike, indicate a turn and change the smartbar’s volume. All of those, bar the volume (and lights) have physical controls too. It’s a cute idea and presents a hands-free option, but in practice, I do wonder how useful it is over a nice button you can mash.</p><p>Another feature that feels like technology doesn’t necessarily improve is the bell. On this bike it’s built into the fingerprint reader. A long press activates voice recognition, a short press will emit a digital “ring ring.” It works fine, but it’s not as responsive as a physical bell would be. I had times where I was approaching someone from behind and wanted to alert them to my presence, only for the bell to sound half a second after I passed them. Other times it took two or three tries for it to even trigger.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f2945440-51f4-11ec-b56f-93f073644eb7" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="7083c232-007e-38cd-8256-b9e1918f4447"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The experience with the alarm also needs a little smoothing out. I love the idea that I can leave the bike “locked” and if anyone moves it, it’ll issue an audible alarm. The problem is, the Urtopia will do this <em>any</em> time it’s locked. This might seem fine until you learn that “locked” is basically “standby” and the bike will be in this mode as soon as you connect the battery. So if you put the battery in and then start wheeling the bike out the front door, the alarm will sound.</p><p>There’s an easy fix for this, but also not entirely helpful. Simply turn the bike on and that will disable the alarm. In fairness, this is a quirk of it being a prototype. Production models will allow you to disable the alarm with the fingerprint sensor or the companion app, but this isn’t something I could test. It’s worth mentioning that, right now, there’s no actual way to turn the bike off other than by removing the battery, so fingers crossed these are some kinks that can be ironed out by launch. I asked a company representative if this was the plan and he confirmed that it was.</p><p>So, tech aside, what does this thing ride like? The sitting position puts you leaning forward in more of a racer pose than a typical town bike where you might be more upright. It’s comfortable though, even after mid to long rides (the longest I managed was 11 miles but I was up for more) although the Velo saddle could be a little easier on the butt — it’s fairly hard and doesn’t appear to be gel-lined.</p><p>In pedal mode, there’s no noticeable resistance from the motor as expected with a hub of this type. At 13Kg/30 pounds, it’s pretty light for an e-bike — mostly thanks to the carbon fiber body. This means if you don’t want to use the battery it’s still a functional regular bike. Tap up on the D-pad though and things get fun real quick. Like most e-bikes, the Urtopia is limited on its power assistance based on territories. The US version tops out at 20 MPH before you’re on your own and the EU version will cap out at 16 MPH of electric assistance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/133a0690-51f5-11ec-b7ff-709bc06f91d5" alt="Urtopia ebike" data-uuid="00c4c1eb-bd0f-3001-b345-19a6aacc6f76"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The three power modes all feel pretty fast. That’s to say, even “eco” mode will help you along nicely. Step up to Comfort mode and you probably have nearly all the power you need to get where you’re going and have a good balance of exercise and assistance. In Sport mode, this thing feels really quite fast despite the standard limitations. I often found myself dropping back down to Comfort mode when other humans were near as it can feel quite lively — in a good way.</p><p>If you really are feeling like chilling out and letting the bike do all the work, there’s also that Turbo mode. Long press Up on the D-pad and even the lightest of pedaling will soon get you to 20mph. Given the racey aesthetic and the forward seating position, this is a lot of fun for not a lot of effort.</p><p>With that in mind, I should mention the range. Urtopia claims you should be good for anything between 30 and 80 assisted miles. This will obviously depend on the terrain and which power mode you’re in, and it’s quite a wide estimate. I haven’t run the battery down yet, but the indicator on the smartbar did seem to get quite low even on a 10-mile ride. It’s hard to know if this is a prototype quirk or just that the battery is draining fast (which, again, could be something that changes in final hardware with final firmware? Hard to know).</p><p>This is why I saved the section on GPS and the 4G connectivity until now. One of the more interesting selling points here for me is that you will be able to track and locate the bike on a map at almost any time. The company tells me it plans to offer data bundles for the 4G connectivity for about $30 a year — which seems pretty reasonable for the peace of mind of being able to locate your bike anywhere if it were to go missing. My question is… what impact might this have on the battery if it’s pinging GPS and running 4G while idle? Alas, a question I can’t answer until we get to try the final model.</p><p>The same question goes for the mmWave sensors. Another thing I am currently unable to test.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I do know is that as the bike is right now, it’s incredibly fun to ride and thanks to the weight, fairly easy to handle (I live in a fifth-floor apartment, so wrangling it into the small elevator is thankfully more manageable). The techno styling might not be to everyone’s taste, but I’m quite fond of it. And most importantly, it’s nice to see something so tech-forward, even if some of the headline features weren’t ready. I am eager to try them once they are and after speaking with the company I got the sense there is more to come. I jokingly suggested they should allow music through the smartbar speaker (the bike has Bluetooth) and they suggested that was possible as are the required OTA updates to deliver such new features.</p><p>Right now, the Urtopia is available for pre-order via <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/urtopia-carbon-electric-bike-new-urban-utopia--2#/">Indiegogo</a>. As such, the standard caveats apply, but given how close to final the prototype I have is, it doesn’t seem like there’s any more development to be done, just some fine-tuning on those remaining features. If you do pre-order you’ll be able to pick one up for $2,000 which is a really competitive price even for the bike without those extra features enabled. According to the campaign, that price will almost double once it goes to retail, so if you’re taken by what you see, there’s a decent incentive to get on board sooner rather than later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d22f9960-78f3-457a-98f7-340bd51ebe45</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638365917</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T13:38:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e6a90-51e6-11ec-b7f7-5b241ac80010" width="2000" height="1245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e6a90-51e6-11ec-b7f7-5b241ac80010" width="2000" height="1245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urtopia ebike,]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urtopia ebike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's 2021 Wrapped is here to chronicle your year in music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In early December, Spotify rolls out its Wrapped year-in-review so that users can relive their go-to artists, songs and podcasts from the last several months. Today, the service is debuting <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-01/the-wait-is-over-your-spotify-2021-wrapped-is-here">the 2021 installment</a> with some familiar features and a number of new additions, both of which are personalized to each listener&#39;s streaming habits. Like before, you&#39;ll get all the info on your top artists, genres, songs, podcasts and total minutes listened with the ability to share those details on Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and, for the first time ever, TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>With Wrapped 2021, Spotify is once again using the stories-style format it revealed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2020-050142508.html">last year</a>. The company is continuing to make this personalized retrospective exclusive to its mobile apps on iOS and Android. Here, you&#39;ll get all of your stats along with a number of playlists the service will build based on your months of listening. Those include Your Top Songs 2021 and Your Artists Revealed, appearing alongside service-wide lists for the Top Tracks and Top Artists of the year. Spotify has also compiled playlists for its library of podcasts, including Best Episodes of 2021 and Best New Podcasts of 2021, to help you discover what was popular in the world of episodic content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1ca7edb0-52ad-11ec-bfff-5cf0dbc501ca" alt="Spotify Wrapped 2021" data-uuid="a0b9bf92-b67c-323a-b592-8ed7c6859f43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure><p>In terms of new features, Spotify has added a &quot;2021: The Movie&quot; section to the Wrapped story carousel. This assigns songs from your activity to opening credits, a training montage and dance-off of a theoretical film for your 2021 music habits. Spotify also added &quot;Your Audio Aura&quot; that displays colors based on your go-to music moods — like &quot;confident&quot; and &quot;bold.&quot; The story section includes a Two Truths game as well, where you are presented with three potential facts about what you listened to most with the goal of trying to pick out the lie. Lastly, the company is leveraging its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-blend-now-available-globally-130055950.html">Blend feature</a> that compares your music with a friend&#39;s listening activity. For Wrapped, Blend will analyze your year of streaming with someone you know to mind commonalities.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside Wrapped, Spotify has also announced the most popular artists on the platform for 2021. For the second straight year, Bad Bunny took the top spot globally, amassing over 9.1 billion streams this year. Olivia Rodrigo&#39;s &quot;drivers license&quot; and <em>SOUR </em>were the global top song and top album, respectively. And a revelation that shouldn&#39;t be too shocking: <em>The Joe Rogan Experience, </em>a Spotify exclusive, was the top podcast both globally and in the US.

This bundle doesn&#39;t come with the wireless charging base that Lenovo introduced with the Smart Clock 2, but consider the display itself is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:$50 today" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/EaRPQQ">$50 today</a> at Best Buy, this deal would be a great one even if the light bulb wasn&#39;t in the picture.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=CW-LSClock2bundle&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F507060083%3F" id="654a7f06bf2a425d98faabd731e33875" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Smart Clock 2 bundle at Walmart - $25</a><p>The design of the Smart Clock 2 is a bit different from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-lenovo-smart-clock-review.html">original</a> in that it has a wider base, but the four-inch screen size remains the same. Lenovo also moved the speakers to the front of the device, resulting in a larger chin underneath the display. It doesn&#39;t hinder the minimalist look of the smart clock, and since it also means the speakers now fire outwards, it should actually help the blaring noise of your alarm reach your ears regardless of the position of the clock in relation to your bed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest new feature on the Smart Clock 2 is that the screen can now double as a night light and you can swipe down on the display to enable it. You can still ask the Google Assistant to activate the night light, but the extra gesture makes it so you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to speak to get some extra light in the middle of the night. Otherwise, the Smart Clock 2 can do everything the original device can, including show weather forecasts, enable alarms, play music and control smart home devices. Lenovo also kept a camera out of the equation yet again, which will make the Smart Clock 2 a more appealing option for those who have no desire to video chat using the alarm on their bedside table.</p><p>We can&#39;t speak for the quality of the Lenovo smart light bulb that&#39;s included in the bundle, but we can say that it supports white and color options with adjustable temperature and brightness. In addition to the companion mobile app, you can control the bulb using the Google Assistant or Alexa — and we expect you may do so using the former quite a bit if you pick up this bundle. If you have a small room in your home that you want to make a bit smarter, this Lenovo bundle is a solid, inexpensive way to do that.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-lenovo-smart-clock-2-bundled-with-a-smart-light-is-on-sale-for-25-right-now-135610566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88701aff-c08d-4794-be96-d7cc5b30ca5f</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 13:56:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638366974</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T13:56:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A gray Lenovo Smart Clock 2 on a wireless charging dock with its screen facing the camera.

However, the company didn&#39;t want to reveal independent investigations into its executives, including the probe into Bill Gates. One of the proposal&#39;s key requests is the disclosure of executive-level investigations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the news that Bill and Melinda Gates were having a divorce, reports came out accusing the former of questionable behavior. The Microsoft co-founder allegedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/16/business/bill-melinda-gates-divorce-epstein.html">pursued women</a> who worked for him at the tech giant and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2019, Microsoft&#39;s board of directors opened an investigation after discovering that he had an affair with an employee around 20 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The greater transparency around sexual harassment in the company was proposed by financial services provider Arjuna Capital. Natasha Lamb, a portfolio manager at Arjuna, <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/microsoft-investors-vote-for-review-following-bill-gates-scandal">said during the meeting</a> that the investor is &quot;concerned about Microsoft&#39;s alleged continued culture of workplace sexual harassment and its history of unfulfilled previous commitments to resolve it.&quot; Arjuna said the reports about the probe into Gates&#39; affair and behavior that came out earlier this year &quot;put into question whether Microsoft was maintaining and protecting a culture of sexual harassment, especially seeing how Bill Gates was protected around this issue by the board.&quot;</p><p>Despite advising against voting for the proposal, Microsoft will take steps to comply with it. Company President Brad Smith said Microsoft will bring in a third party to assess its investigations and will share what those assessments contain. He also gave a taste of what the annual reports would include: Apparently, the tech giant received 51 complaints from employees in the fiscal year ending in June, and 47 percent of them were substantiated. The year before that, it received 142 complaints.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">115492f9-139e-43f4-a783-5ad04ea14dc2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 11:38:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638358754</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/fcd8d9f0-3eee-11ea-b6df-e35ac00c061c" width="4815" height="3397" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 27: CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella and CEO of Volkswagen, Herbert Diess (not seen) attend a session during their visit to Volkswagen Digital Lab in Berlin, Germany on February 27, 2019.

The company says firmware version 3.0.999.284 significantly improves the feature&#39;s performance, stability and accuracy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">HTC&#39;s Vive Focus 3</a> launched with hand tracking back in July, allowing users to use their hands as controllers. With this software engine upgrade, HTC says the headset will be able to track fast hand movements more easily and recognize pinch-to-zoom gestures more accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the company opened the feature to developers, these improvements would translate to better hand tracking within applications. Developers can integrate the headset&#39;s six current predefined hand gestures into their VR apps, and HTC previously <a href="https://www.vive.com/eu/support/focus3/category_howto/hand-tracking.html">said</a> that additional gestures will be added in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>HTC said in its announcement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Being able to navigate virtual environments naturally and intuitively will go a long way towards making VR more accessible to everyone, no matter their familiarity with technology. As we step into the metaverse era, we couldn’t be more excited to bring these quality-of-life improvements to all VIVE Focus 3 customers around the world.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>When the manufacturer launched the Vive Focus 3 back in July, we found it to be the best standalone VR headset yet. It&#39;s not a direct competitor to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-quest-mobile-mixed-reality-camera-204734242.html">Quest 2</a>, however, seeing as it costs $1,300. Unlike the Oculus (now Meta) headset, it targets business users and not ordinary consumers who want to enjoy VR experiences in their own home.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-hand-tracking-update-090734043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20694278-b445-42b5-8b46-e444882e4825</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 09:07:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638349691</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T09:08:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0e6f7700-5275-11ec-adbf-b16adcd2556c" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Virtual modular synth VCV Rack 2 is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://vcvrack.com/news/2021-11-30-Rack-2-released">VCV Rack 2</a> has arrived, and it could help you figure out if modular synthesis is something you can get into before blowing a fortune on it. The original app dropped in 2017, giving you access to thousands of virtual modules that let you try Eurorack for free. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-virtual-eurorack-synth-november-vst-plugin-superbooth-223810427.html">upgraded app</a> comes with a completely redesigned user interface with a dark room mode and a much better module browser than its predecessor. VCV has a library of almost 2,700 modules, and the new browser will make them easier to sort with its category filters and the capability to highlight the modules you use the most.</p><p>While the app itself is still free to download and use, there&#39;s now a Pro version that includes a VST plugin for full integration into the digital audio workstation of your choice. That means you&#39;ll be able to use VCV Rack within Ableton, Logic or even GarageBand. The Pro tier also comes with professional support — and the promise of more plugin formats in the future. Rack 2&#39;s paid version will set you back $99 until 2022, though you can also get it bundled with VCV Drums and VCV Sound Stage for $209. You can get both paid and free VCV Rack 2 versions right now from its <a href="https://vcvrack.com/Rack">official page</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="55250e107f2e40e0a46b5e69fcfbe1f7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HYft3MFOCJQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vcv-rack-2-now-available-060611374.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9222d1d9-01b2-4ac4-b207-ca197d51f81a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 06:06:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638338807</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T06:06:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c2544e0-5266-11ec-bfb5-2324b41a3326" width="1600" height="1034" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VCV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch will use machine learning to catch ban-dodging trolls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch is introducing a new machine learning feature to help streamers protect their channels from people attempting to avoid bans.

This year was no different with the company taking the opportunity to unveil the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. That’s right, for the second year in a row, Qualcomm is moving away from the sequential numbering scheme that has defined its processors for years. Just as the Snapdragon 865 gave way to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">888</a>, the company will now replace the 888 with the Gen 1.&nbsp;</p><p>The system-on-a-chip includes Qualcomm’s own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-10-gigabit-5g-modem-x65-151851346.html"><ins>X65 5G modem</ins></a>. The company says it’s capable of theoretical download speeds of 10Gbps. That’s one of those specs that’s impressive on paper, but won’t mean much out in the real world since some of the fastest 5G networks can’t deliver speeds greater than 4Gbps in ideal conditions. If you have access to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-linksys-wifi-6e-routers-now-available-130016648.html"><ins>WiFi 6 or 6E</ins></a> router, the Gen 1 can sustain download speeds of 3.6 Gbps over WiFi.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with its past flagship chipsets, Qualcomm has put significant effort into improving the camera experience. The Gen 1 features an 18-bit image signal processor. That’s a first for the company, and something it says allows the component to process 4,000 times more data than the 14-bit Spectra ISP found on the Snapdragon 888. Additionally, phones with the Gen 1 will have the ability to capture photos at 3.2 gigapixels per second. In practice, that means the Gen 1 can process data from three 36-megapixel cameras simultaneously without any shutter lag, according to Qualcomm.</p><p>In another first for a mobile device, the company says the chipset can record 8K HDR footage at 30 frames per second. Again, that’s not the most practical feature for a phone in 2021 since 4K is the top end for most content. On that note, the Gen 1 supports UHD capture at 120 frames per second and can record slow motion footage at 960 frames per second at 720p. Separate from its Spectra ISP, the Gen 1 includes a always-on image signal processor that can power a camera while consuming very little battery power. It’s a feature that will allow Gen 1-equipped devices to offer always-on face detection for biometric authentication.</p><p>The Gen 1 won’t offer greatly improved CPU performance over what was already possible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html"><ins>Snapdragon 888 Plus</ins></a>. What it does promise is faster performance when it comes to AI-related tasks. That’s thanks to Qualcomm’s new seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is up to four times faster than its predecessor thanks to more shared memory and a faster tensor accelerator. Gaming performance is another highlight of the Gen 1. According to Qualcomm, its latest Adreno GPU offers 30 percent faster rendering performance while consuming 25 percent less power. Over on the audio front, the Gen 1 includes support for Qualcomm’s recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html"><ins>aptX Lossless</ins></a> Bluetooth codec. It can deliver up to CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection.</p><p>Rounding out the Gen 1’s feature list is a dedicated Trust Management Engine. The Gen 1 is the first mobile chipset to support Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-ready-se-alliance-204241463.html"><ins>Android Ready SE</ins></a> standard out of the box, which means it has the capability to store things like digital car keys and IDs.</p><p>With its mix of performance improvements and new features, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 offers an intriguing look at the next generation of Android flagships. Now we have to wait to see what capabilities manufacturers decide to enable in their latest devices. The first Gen 1-equipped phones will arrive later this year, with more expected to come in the first half of 2022.</p><p>Separately, Qualcomm announced it’s partnering with Google to bring the company’s Neural Architecture Search platform to its product portfolio. The technology, which will be available first on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, allows companies to create and optimize AI models automatically instead of manually. According to Google, NAS optimize AI models in weeks rather than months.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd9c5a4e-3bdd-40fb-be9b-6c557850dc67</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 23:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637948983</ingested><modified>2021-11-26T17:49:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db5e8100-4edf-11ec-b7fe-fcedab9b4b76" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db5e8100-4edf-11ec-b7fe-fcedab9b4b76" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
