The company released <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/civil-rights-audit-progress-report/"><ins>an update</ins></a> detailing its progress on addressing the auditors&#39; many recommendations.</p><p>According to the company, it has already implemented 65 of the 117 recommendations, with another 42 listed as ”in progress or ongoing.” However, there are six areas where the company says it is still determining the “feasibility” of making changes and two recommendations where the company has “declined” to take further action. And, notably, some of these deal with the most contentious issues called out in the original 2020 audit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That original report, released in July of 2020, found the company needed to do more to stop &quot;pushing users toward extremist echo chambers.&quot; It also said the company needed to address issues related to algorithmic bias, and criticized the company’s handling of Donald Trump’s posts. In its <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Metas-Progress-on-Civil-Rights-Audit-Commitments.pdf"><ins>latest update</ins></a>, Meta says it still hasn’t committed to all the changes the auditors called for related to algorithmic bias. The company has implemented some changes, like engaging with outside experts and increasing the diversity of its AI team, but says other changes are still “under evaluation.”</p><p>Specifically, the auditors called for a mandatory, company-wide process for “to avoid, identify, and address potential sources of bias and discriminatory outcomes when developing or deploying AI and machine learning models” and that it “regularly test existing algorithms and machine-learning models.” Meta said the recommendation is “under evaluation.” Likewise, the audit also recommended “mandatory training on understanding and mitigating sources of bias and discrimination in AI for all teams building algorithms and machine-learning models.” That suggestion is also listed as “under evaluation,” according to Meta.</p><p>The company also says some updates related to content moderation are also “under evaluation.” These include a recommendation to improve the “transparency and consistency” of decisions related to moderation appeals, and a recommendation that the company study more aspects of how hate speech spreads, and how it can use that data to address targeted hate more quickly. The auditors also recommended that Meta “disclose additional data” about which users are being targeted with voter suppression on its platform. That recommendation is also “under evaluation.”</p><p>The only two recommendations that Meta outright declined were also related to elections and census policies. “The Auditors recommended that all user-generated reports of voter interference be routed to content reviewers to make a determination on whether the content violates our policies, and that an appeals option be added for reported voter interference content,” Meta wrote. But the company said it opted not to make those changes because it would slow down the review process, and because “the vast majority of content reported as voter interference does not violate the company’s policies.”</p><p>Separately, Meta also said it’s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/inclusive-products-through-race-data-measurement/"><ins>working on</ins></a> a “a framework for studying our platforms and identifying opportunities to increase fairness when it comes to race in the United States.” To accomplish this, the company will conduct “off-platform surveys” and analyze its own data using surnames and zip codes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-is-still-working-on-changes-recommended-in-civil-rights-audit-003011165.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b0a23ecf-43dc-4460-87ef-a5b589f2394c</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 00:30:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637279845</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T23:57:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2162cec0-48ca-11ec-b96e-55f21efe0984" width="5066" height="3207" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2162cec0-48ca-11ec-b96e-55f21efe0984" width="5066" height="3207" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta is seen on smartphone in this illustration picture taken October 28, 2021.

This one is called “Rage Shake,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like. If you’re using Instagram and something isn’t working properly, shake your phone. Doing so will cause the app’s bug report interface to appear. You can then tell the company what happened. Mosseri says it will help Instagram prioritize the specific bugs it needs to address. Rage Shake is currently only available in the US.</p><p>Both features won’t change how you use Instagram, but they should be welcome additions all the same.

California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee and Vermont are concerned Meta might be offering and promoting Instagram to the younger crowd while knowing the potentials for mental and physical harm. If so, the social media giant might violate states&#39; consumer protection laws.</p><p>The investigators are most worried about Meta&#39;s techniques to boost the &quot;frequency and duration&quot; of interactions at the expense of teens. Leaked internal research showed that Instagram <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html">hurt a significant percentage of teens</a>, particularly girls, resulting in issues ranging from depression to self-harm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Meta spokesperson told Engadget the accusations were &quot;false&quot; and showed a &quot;deep misunderstanding&quot; of the situation.

There&#39;s also no certainty the probe will lead to more substantive action. Nonetheless, the company is under much more pressure to safeguard teens — it could face legal repercussions if the states don&#39;t feel it has done enough.</p><blockquote><p>These accusations are false and demonstrate a deep misunderstanding of the facts.

Twitter Blue is a $3 monthly subscription that buys subscribers access to additional features, like an undo button and ad-free news articles.</p><p>For now, Twitter Blue comes with a fairly limited set of extra features designed for the people who spend the most time on the service. According to Twitter’s Sara Beukpour, this group includes “verified longtime Twitter users” as well as “news lovers” and other “super tweeters.” In other words: the 25 percent of Twitter’s user base who send <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/11/15/the-behaviors-and-attitudes-of-u-s-adults-on-twitter/"><ins>97 percent</ins></a> of all tweets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I actually bet many of them are you,” Beykpour said during a briefing with a group of tech reporters last week. Of course I signed up immediately.</p><p>And after a little more than a week with Twitter Blue, I’m not sure it’s worth $3 a month for most people. The features are mostly useful, but it’s frustrating that not everything works the same way across Twitter’s app and website. But there are undoubtedly useful features, and I am intrigued by what might come next for “premium Twitter.” For now, though, here’s a look at what $3 buys you.</p><h2>‘Undo’ tweets</h2><p>Of all the features in Twitter Blue, the “undo” button has gotten the most hype. Twitter will likely never give us an actual <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-twitter-edit-tweet-button-jack-dorsey.html"><ins>edit button</ins></a>, so this is probably the closest we’ll ever get. And if you’re prone to typos or tweeting-and-then-instantly-regretting, this feature alone might be worth the subscription. I say might because the “undo” can also be incredibly confusing, and doesn’t always work as you expect.</p><p>It’s supposed to work pretty much like Gmail’s “undo send” feature. After you hit “send,” you’ll have a few seconds when you can see the tweet you just wrote, but it hasn’t actually been published. If you change your mind for whatever reason, you can hit “undo,” which takes you back to the tweet in the compose screen. Twitter gives you the ability to set how long this window is — it can range from 5 seconds to a full 60 seconds — and you can always opt to send it before the window runs out with an extra click.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c6e70550-48a7-11ec-8fb7-d27eb1921836" style="height:997;width:1125;" alt="You can undo a quote tweet on twitter&#39;s app but not twitter.com" data-uuid="8c0e32bc-5bfb-30a0-bd3e-4a2b4234177b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Twitter</div></figure><p>But undoing a tweet doesn’t always work the same way across Twitter’s app and website. On Twitter’s app, you can use the “undo” feature for almost any type of tweet: original tweets (tweets sent from the main compose window), replies, threads, quote tweets and polls. Essentially, you can “undo” almost anything you tweet, anywhere in the app. But that’s <em>not</em> the case on twitter.com, where the undo function only works with original tweets and replies, but not with quote tweets or threads. Unless you exclusively tweet from your phone, this means you have to remember which tweets are <del>editable</del> undoable and which aren&#39;t. A typo-ridden tweet can be undone, but an ill-advised quote tweet cannot.</p><p>There’s also the fact that it can take several steps to actually undo a tweet. In Twitter’s app, the default setting is that the first thing you see after you mash the tweet button is your tweet and an “undo” button. This gives you plenty of time to give it another read, even if you have a relatively short undo “window.” But on Twitter’s website, you can only undo by looking for a “view tweet” dialog <em>at the bottom</em> of the page and <em>then</em> navigating to the page with your tweet and the undo button.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, &quot;view tweet&quot; doesn&#39;t appear at all, and the only way to access the &quot;undo&quot; is to navigate to your profile and look for the pending tweet on your timeline. Not only is this a confusing extra step, but it also makes it harder to take advantage of the undo button at all. Is it still useful to have? I guess, but the unpredictability of it kind of gave me more anxiety than just not having it at all.</p><h2>Reader mode and bookmark folders</h2><p>The reader mode is probably the most underrated feature of Twitter Blue, and the one I’d argue would be most useful for all the site’s users, not just those willing to pay. It converts long threads into a much more readable stream of text, much like a browser’s reader view would. I hate those intrusive (and <a href="https://www.erynnbrook.com/when-twitter-threads-fly-away/"><ins>ethically</ins></a> dubious) third-party thread apps that “unroll” tweets into separate websites, but there’s a reason why those services are so popular: lengthy threads are difficult to read. Twitter’s service was never designed for essay-length tweet storms, and long threads are often cut off. Reader mode is a simple solution that is so effective I can’t believe it took them this long to make.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ab4097a0-48aa-11ec-a83f-1171074c989e" style="height:1363;width:1125;" alt="Twitter bookmark folders." data-uuid="2d4c8b7a-1783-377f-8747-abc23f4ece26"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Twitter</div></figure><p>It’s even better when paired with another new feature: bookmark folders. Now, when I come across an impossibly long tweetstorm I want to come back to later, I simply add it to my “to read” folder and keep scrolling. Except, again, bookmark folders are for now only supported in Twitter’s app. Head over to twitter.com and all your bookmarks are still a mess.</p><h2>Ad-free news and ‘top articles’</h2><p>My favorite Twitter Blue feature — and a large part of the reason why I will likely continue handing over $3 each month for it — is the “top articles” feature. The feature shows you a list of all the most-shared news articles by people in your Twitter network over the last 24 hours. If that sounds at all familiar, it’s because the feature is Twitter’s nod to Nuzzel, a once independent news app that also created feeds of articles based on what was being shared by people you follow on Twitter. But the original app was shut down when Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-acquires-scroll-subscription-service-171621757.html"><ins>acquired Scroll</ins></a>, the news startup that had previously bought Nuzzel.</p><p>And while “Top Articles&#39;&#39; doesn&#39;t have all the functionality Nuzzel once did, it’s enough to scratch the itch for former fans of the app (a group that seems to be almost entirely made up of journalists as far as I can tell). But even if you never used Nuzzel, Top Articles is useful. It gives you a quick digest of what the people you follow are reading and tweeting about. Or, you know, you can just use it to figure out who is the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character"><ins>main character</ins></a> of the day.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/afa23980-48a9-11ec-bd37-a9d668dfbc09" style="height:1224;width:1125;" alt="Twitter&#39;s nod to news app Nuzzel is the " data-uuid="ffa4dfbe-3374-3ced-983f-f29dad45d346"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Twitter</div></figure><p>Twitter’s acquisition of Scroll also powers another significant part of Twitter Blue: ad-free news articles. Scroll (and now Twitter) formed partnerships with hundreds of news outlets in order to offer ad-free browsing in exchange for a portion of users’ subscription fees. Now, Twitter lets subscribers view how much their own browsing has directed to those publishers. It’s an intriguing concept, and one that won Scroll a lot of praise before it was bought by Twitter.</p><p>It’s also the aspect of Twitter Blue I’m most curious to watch. As it stands now, it can feel a little disjointed. While stripping out ads is nice, it doesn’t include access to paywalled content, so it can be jarring to see an “ad-free with Twitter Blue” banner only to hit a paywall. However, Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html"><ins>has hinted</ins></a> that it may one day pursue more ways to access paywalled content — and a message in the app says paywall access isn’t included “right now” — so there’s good reason to hope that may one day change.</p><h2>Early access to new features and customization</h2><p>Twitter has gotten much more public with the features it experiments with in recent years. The company at one point had a separate beta version of the app it used to try out new tweaks. That app is no longer available, but the “labs” feature of Twitter Blue feels in some ways like its successor. The company plans to make some experimental features available to Twitter Blue subscribers first, before deciding whether they should become full-fledged features available to more people.</p><p>For now, there are only two features that fall into this bucket: the ability to pin specific chats to the top of your DM inbox, and the ability to upload videos of up to 10 minutes (these longer videos are not entirely new, but accounts had to be approved by Twitter in order to have access to the feature). I appreciate having the option to do both, though I haven’t used either feature and I suspect most others won’t either.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/07395200-48aa-11ec-9ff8-e1500f433b5d" style="height:498;width:1107;" alt="Some of the new &#39;seasonal&#39; app icons that comes with Twitter Blue." data-uuid="1027d2da-f72d-33c6-8b97-25366c0b86fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Twitter</div></figure><p>Finally, Twitter Blue also gives you the ability to make small tweaks to the look and feel of the Twitter app. For example, you can change the app icon or set a new color theme (the “theme” only changes small elements like the color of the tweet composer and the dot that appears when you have a new notification). You can also opt to rearrange the shortcuts in the bottom of the app’s navigation bar, which is kind of cool (especially if you want to, say, banish the Spaces Tab). But, again, these are small details that I can’t imagine most people bothering to change.</p><h2>Is it worth it?</h2><p>Whether or not you think all that is worth three bucks a month largely depends on how much you use Twitter (and how willing you are to pay for apps). While I don’t think it makes sense for most people, I think it’s pretty compelling for anyone who depends on Twitter for their job or otherwise falls into that extra-dedicated “super tweeter” category.</p><p>And while Twitter hasn’t offered any details around how many subscribers have signed up, the app has made about $180,000 since it first started offering Twitter Blue this summer, according to data provided by analytics firm Sensor Tower. That’s not much money for Twitter, but it does suggest there is a not-totally-insignificant number of people willing to try it out (and the service is still only available in four countries).</p><p>At a broader level, Twitter Blue raises important questions about how the company will prioritize new features. While the company has maintained that there will always be a free version of Twitter, it’s not difficult to imagine that the most exciting and useful updates could end up being locked behind a subscription. Twitter spent much of the last decade not really creating any meaningful new features at all, so it still stings a little to see the company add the kinds of features longtime users have long hoped for, only to restrict them to those willing to pay.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">476c7774-2367-4272-8fb7-cd7331a90006</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 21:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637267903</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T20:38:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ffeccfc0-48ab-11ec-bff3-e2cee1f9a641" width="3753" height="2502" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ffeccfc0-48ab-11ec-bff3-e2cee1f9a641" width="3753" height="2502" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/04: In this photo illustration, Twitter logo is seen on a smartphone in a hand in front of a Twitter webpage about launch new subscription service Twitter Blue.

The petition notes that Kotick &quot;owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.&quot; When employee advocacy group A Better ABK shared the petition on Twitter, it said more than 500 workers had signed it. Hundreds more added their names within a couple of hours.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the claims in the report are one that Kotick was the person who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-executives-harassment-discrimination-lawsuit-response-192228768.html">wrote an email</a> sent to employees by executive vice president of corporate affairs Frances Townsend after California&#39;s Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">filed</a> a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against Activision Blizzard in July. &quot;A recently filed lawsuit presented a distorted and untrue picture of our company, including factually incorrect, old and out of context stories — some from more than a decade ago,&quot; the memo read. Hundreds of Blizzard employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html">slammed the message</a> and demanded &quot;immediate corrections&quot; from company leaders.</p><p>The report also shed some light on the departure of Jen Oneal, who was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">named as a co-lead</a> of Blizzard in August but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html">announced three months later</a> that she was leaving her position. In a September email to the company&#39;s legal team, Oneal (who is Asian-American and gay) is said to have written that she had been &quot;tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against&quot; and that she was paid less than Blizzard co-lead Mike Ybarra. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-jen-oneal-mike-ybarra-equal-pay-after-resignation"><em>IGN </em>later reported</a> that Ybarra and Oneal asked management for equal compensation, but Oneal said they were only offered equivalent offers after she tendered her resignation.</p><p>Following <em>The Journal&#39;s</em> report, the Activision Blizzard board publicly gave its backing to Kotick. However, the backlash is intensifying. Before the petition, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22785788/bobby-kotick-resign-activision-blizzard-controversy-allegations"><em>Polygon</em></a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-17-the-games-industry-must-not-tolerate-people-like-bobby-kotick-anymore"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> called for him to resign in editorials. A group of activist shareholders, who <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1460991941332582405">hold around 0.6 percent</a> of stock and have long criticized Kotick, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/17/bobby-kotick-resignation-shareholders/">demanded</a> that he step down.</p><p>On top of that, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jim-ryan-email-activision-blizzard-195248273.html">told his employees</a> that he was “disheartened and frankly stunned to read” <em>The Journal&#39;s</em> report. “We outreached to Activision immediately after the article was published to express our deep concern and to ask how they plan to address the claims made in the article,” Ryan wrote in the email, which was leaked. “We do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”</p><p>This week&#39;s report and ensuing pressure on Kotick follows a torrid few months for leaders at Activision Blizzard. After DFEH filed its lawsuit, it emerged that the Securities and Exchange Commission is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sec-activision-blizzard-investigation-212143469.html">investigating the company</a>. Activision Blizzard is also facing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">class action lawsuit</a> from shareholders, who claim it violated securities laws. In addition, workers and the Communication Workers of America <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-nlrb-labor-complaint-194037754.html">filed an unfair labor practice complaint</a> against the company.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked for comment, Activision Blizzard directed Engadget to the statement the board of directors made on Tuesday. &quot;The goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious,&quot; it said. &quot;The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick&#39;s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f7be157-a55f-45bf-82bc-2f998e508f53</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 19:45:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637265758</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T20:02:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c8189cf0-48a6-11ec-b3dd-a4b35256bd15" width="4200" height="2787" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c8189cf0-48a6-11ec-b3dd-a4b35256bd15" width="4200" height="2787" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allen J.

On Thursday, Nike announced a <a href="https://news.nike.com/news/five-things-to-know-roblox">partnership with Roblox</a> to offer a free virtual playspace called Nikeland. In its current iteration, Nikeland includes minigames such as tag, dodgeball and the floor is lava that players can check out with their friends. Mobile integration allows you to use your phone to translate real-life movement into the game. In that way, you can do things like long jumps and fast sprints. Naturally, there’s also a digital showroom where players can get Nike swag for their avatar.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/nike-teams-up-with-roblox-to-create-a-virtual-world-called-nikeland-.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_content=Main&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1637254994"><em>CNBC</em></a>, that’s only the start of what the brand has planned for the space.

The showroom could also one day tease future product releases and allow users to co-create items.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s no surprise to see Nike partner with Roblox on a metaverse play. With more than <a href="https://backlinko.com/roblox-users">200 million estimated monthly active users</a>, it’s one of the most popular games among kids and teenagers.

As expected, the Solterra shares many similarities with Toyota’s upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-details-140056332.html">bZ4X crossover</a>. That should come as no surprise since the two automakers jointly developed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-suv-concept-202644349.html">e-TNGA powertrain</a> at the heart of both electric vehicles.</p><p>Subaru’s crossover features a 71.4 kWh lithium battery that the automaker estimates will provide 220 miles of range on a single charge.

The latter offers better traction in off-road conditions. Inside the cabin, there’s a 12.3-inch touchscreen display that works with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Solterra will also mark the debut of a couple of new safety technologies for Subaru. First, there’s a 360-degree “Surround-View” camera the company says allows for better situational awareness. Second, there’s a feature called Safe Exit Assist that will warn your passengers if a vehicle is approaching as they’re about to exit the car.</p><p>Subaru will start selling the 2023 Solterra sometime in mid-2022.

I’m not really an arts and crafts kind of guy. Sure, I’ll do the occasional project with my four-year-old. I also like to make things (beer, music, small electronics) and generally have a pretty strong DIY streak. But I don’t really traffic in the same mediums as the traditional <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut" href="https://fave.co/32g5P6n">Cricut</a> crowd: cardstock, fabric, vinyl, et cetera.</p><p>This sort of stuff is more my wife’s territory. She made the decorations, bouquets and the invitations for our wedding. She crochets <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/164298499/bubble-bobble-blanket?ref=shop_review">video-game</a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/121410693/galaga-blanket?ref=shop_review">themed</a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/126104773/take-this-throw?ref=shop_review">blankets</a>. And she made a robot costume out of cardboard and aluminum foil for our kid. So honestly, I was kind of hoping she’d come to the table with a bunch of project ideas to put the $300 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Explore 3" href="https://fave.co/3nraY3E">Cricut Explore 3</a> through its paces. Suffice to say, she let me down. (I still love her, though.) So I was largely on my own as I tried to figure out what exactly an Engadget review of a Cricut machine should look like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I guess to start, we should establish what exactly a Cricut is. It’s basically a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-14-nomad-883-desktop-cnc-machine.html">desktop CNC machine</a> that’s designed to cut things like fabric, paper and vinyl, as opposed to wood or metal. The whole idea is to let your average DIYer quickly and easily cut intricate shapes and patterns with extreme precision.</p><p>The first thing I did: I made a delicate vinyl decal of a mixtape to stick on my laptop. Then I made one to stick on one of my guitar pedals. And a floppy disk decal that I put on top of a canvas board I painted. You get the picture. Basically, I just cut out a bunch of decals.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25027110-4885-11ec-bdfc-8ef80def4369" alt="Mixed Tape decal cut with Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="281bd7ca-9a91-331e-8c69-35d2438bb845"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The process for doing these things is almost idiot proof. The Design Space app (available for macOS, Windows, Android and iOS) where you layout your creations is incredibly simple to use and offers access to over 1,000 free images and over 250 projects, ranging from simple stickers to 3D cardboard masks. And if that isn’t enough, you can pay for a <a href="https://cricut.com/en_us/cricut-access.html">Cricut Access</a> membership (starting at $9.99 a month) that opens up over 200,000 images and “thousands” of projects. Or you can pay individually for licensed content from the likes of Disney, Marvel, Warner Bros. and Sesame Street. Or you can upload your own images.</p><p>The latter is pretty simple so long as you stick to line drawings, but it does require occasional cleanup work. For instance, I downloaded a Superman silhouette for my son to color in (he wanted to make his own superhero stickers). But before I could cut it out using the Cricut I had to select and remove the background, otherwise it’d have just cut out a square.</p><p>The instructions in the app for predesigned projects are thorough and clear. And that’s even true for relatively complex ones that require multiple cutting tools, markers and several different materials. It walks you through each step as you load a pen to draw on white cardstock, then cut the shape out, before having you swap in a different color card stock and the scoring tool. And for really involved designs, like the <a href="https://cricut.com/blog/new-in-design-space-3d-masks/">3D cardboard masks</a>, you’ll find a PDF with assembly instructions. (Well, most of the time at least. I only discovered after I cut the pieces for the cardstock fox I tried to build that it had &quot;tips for assembly&quot; as opposed to detailed instructions.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="1896da0fb355404fb5b8ae5ab505a695" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2505cc70-4885-11ec-bbf3-d8689a1cb78d" alt="3D Fox made with Cricut Explore 3"></section><p>The more intense projects that call for multiple materials and multiple cuts to be assembled after the fact can feel a little daunting at first. But as long as you don’t try to rush through without reading directions it’s relatively easy to figure out.</p><p>The bigger issue is, you end up needing <em>a lot</em> of stuff. The Cricut Explore 3 comes with a fine point blade, other tools such as the scoring stylus and foil transfer tool are sold separately, or as part of a bundle with the Cricut starting at $350 (which, if you’re in the market for one as a newcomer I’d highly recommend). But even if you get a bundle, you’ll still probably need to snag some extra stuff if you want to venture beyond stickers, decals and iron-ons.</p><p>See, part of the pitch for the latest Cricut machines is their compatibility with “Smart Materials,” which you’re able to load without using the special mat normally required to hold things in place for cutting. This is, to be clear, a huge advantage. One, it just means there’s fewer variables and less than can go wrong. But it also allows the latest Cricut machines to cut up to 12 feet of material in a single shot, whereas previous versions topped out at 24-inches with a mat. That’s great if you want to create room-covering decals.</p><section data-eng-breakout="317538a1d0894ac28c53777c9a3b8f10" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64c7b570-4886-11ec-b7c2-667e6dc48fce" alt="Cricut Explore 3"></section><p>The one shortcoming is that all the Smart Materials are adhesive in some form. There’s paper and cardstock sticker options, permanent or temporary vinyl decals, and iron-on. If you want to cut regular cardstock, paper or fabric you’ll still need to get mats, which come in four different levels of grippiness. They’re not prohibitively expensive; most people should be able to get by with the 12x12 variety pack, which includes light, standard and strong grip mats that cost $41. But it’s something to be aware of if you want to make greeting cards, paper banners or some of these undeniably awesome <a href="https://d2e2oszluhwxlw.cloudfront.net/img/home/2021/maker/img/CricutMaker3_2_3DAnimal_463x579auto-compress-format-q-75.jpg">3D cardboard figures</a>.</p><p>If you do get those mats you’ll be greatly expanding the cutting capabilities of your Cricut, too. The Explore 3 can cut over 100 different materials from felt, to foil, to leather and light chipboard. If you spring for the $400 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Maker 3" href="https://fave.co/3Cu8Xru">Cricut Maker 3</a> instead, that number jumps to over 300 materials, including acetate, various types of wood sheets and a host of additional fabrics.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8b7f8350-4886-11ec-b5ff-c73e5247da4a" alt="Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="2b148102-a529-3dec-beca-4f7891a193f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Creating your own designs or projects from scratch is a little more complicated. It’s simple enough to slap a few shapes and some text down on the virtual canvas. But If you want to make your own 3D figures, multilayered greeting cards, or print then cut custom stickers, things get a little more difficult. Frankly, it’s something that’s beyond my skill set.</p><p>There are templates in Design Space to help get you started laying out projects. But I found them only minimally useful. They’re basically just generic sketches of objects like bowls, mugs and guitars to give you a rough idea of what your decal or whatever will look like. But they’re not customizable enough to really be relied on for building out a complex design. I used the hoodie template to create an iron-on Spiderman emblem for my son’s Halloween costume. (It was chilly and I knew he wouldn’t want to cover his Spiderman costume with a jacket.) But I was still mostly left guessing when trying to figure out what the final product would look like.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25055740-4885-11ec-a1ff-d307bc2cf356" alt="Spiderman sweatshirt made with Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="c8aa5d2e-4551-35d6-aea7-d6b4d86fdf58"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>At the end of the day, the most important thing to know about  Cricut machines is that they demand patience. Patience to figure out how to use it. Patience to navigate some of the complex projects. And patience to actually put those projects together. (Let me tell you, peeling thin cardstock off one of the mats without tearing it is no easy task.) But, it also feels like magic at times. Watching it as it writes impossibly small and delicate numbers on pieces of cardboard or cuts out intricate designs in vinyl is impressive. Obviously, more complex patterns require more time to cut out, but the Explore 3 is still impressively fast.</p><p>Can I say that a Cricut is absolutely worth the investment? No. It really is going to depend on your particular crafting needs and style. I’m not going to use the Cricut every day, or even every week. But I could see once a month dusting it off to customize something for my kid or to put a personal touch on a small project I’ve been working on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccd06f88-6d6f-4545-95ef-2360394f5fca</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637260864</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T18:41:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25061a90-4885-11ec-9ffa-131f06f95f61" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25061a90-4885-11ec-9ffa-131f06f95f61" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cricut Explore 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cricut Explore 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's second-gen Pixel Stand is available for pre-order]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s second-generation Pixel Stand wasn&#39;t even an option by the time the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel 6</a> shipped, but it&#39;s here now... well, almost.

The company has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176463">introduced</a> a desktop version of Edge with an efficiency mode that &quot;significantly&quot; lowers CPU and memory use, potentially extending your battery life at the expense of raw performance. The feature should kick in when your battery is lo, although there&#39;s also a settings toggle when you&#39;d like to take control.</p><p>You should also have an easier time updating your passwords, whether in response to a breach or just for caution&#39;s sake. The passwords section in Edge&#39;s settings now lets you easily update passwords for sites with a &quot;change&quot; button. The convenience only works for some sites right now, but Microsoft promised compatibility with more sites in the &quot;coming months.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Edge will also add a few shopping features that might help you make smarter choices. An upcoming price alert will let you know if a must-have item is more affordable, while price comparison and history tools are coming to Android users later in November. UK shoppers using Bing can also tap Good On You&#39;s rating system to buy fashion based on social responsibility and sustainability scores.</p><p>Battery-saving features aren&#39;t new. Google gave Chrome some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-86-battery-saving-experiment-223253471.html">longevity-focused improvements</a> last year, for instance. Efficiency mode might give Microsoft a way to stand out, though, and it might be vital if you&#39;d rather not switch browsers (or limit the sites you visit) just to keep using your system for a little while longer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-browser-efficiency-mode-170017525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb6bf2b8-8901-4ce6-9f1e-30c9a295ad46</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637253037</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T16:30:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds memories and exploration features to the Snap Map]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/snapchat/"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-snap-map-places-140030542.html"><ins>Map Layers</ins></a>, features for the Snap Map built around local content.

The performance is nothing to sniff at, with the M1 Pro proving more adept at creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering than last year&#39;s M1 chip. As for battery life, the laptop ran for over 16 and a half hours in our testing.</p><p>Apple made sure there were plenty of ports on the latest model, after going several years with minimal connectivity on MacBook Pros. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, a MagSafe power port, HDMI connectivity, a 3.5mm headphone jack and an SD card reader, but unfortunately no USB-A port. To accommodate all of those, the laptop is a little bulker than its predecessors. That said, the trade off is likely worth it for most people, given that you might not feel the need to carry around a connector hub to connect all your peripherals anymore.</p><p>The MBP has a Liquid Retina XDR display with Mini-LED backlighting that&#39;s capable of outputting 1,600 nits of brightness and support for a 120Hz refresh rate. Apple has at last upgraded the webcam to one with a resolution of 1080p too, which is a significant step up from the 720p version.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The chief executive was quick to admit there was a &quot;lot of risk&quot; and that SpaceX might not succeed, but he figured the team would at least make &quot;a lot of progress.&quot;</p><p>There could be around a dozen further launches in 2022, Musk added. The timing also hinges on an FAA environmental impact review of SpaceX&#39;s Boca Chica launch facility. The agency intends to finish its review before the end of 2021, but a delay might push back upcoming Starship launches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whenever Starship reaches orbit, the vehicle might become economical relatively soon afterward. Musk reckoned SpaceX could start selling Starship launches for less than Falcon 9 in roughly two years.

The Pixel 6 was already a competitively priced flagship smartphone, but this early Black Friday sale makes it even more tempting for Android users in need of an upgrade.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=Chromecast&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FChromecast-with-Google-TV%2F403830906" id="012fba8b204449eaaedef6b8a409b203" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Chromecast with Google TV at Walmart - $39</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/3Py19B" id="e3d3be877452403b87424f4c41b313eb" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub (2nd gen) at Best Buy - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/15yAWd" id="26981347f37840768fac240e4cf1d067" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Audio at Best Buy - $60</a><p>Along with that, a bunch of other Google gadgets have been discounted before the Black Friday frenzy begins.

Starting on November 30th, 20 Verizon stores nationwide will begin selling the device, with online availability to follow on December 2nd. The carrier will sell the glasses for $599, and while you can use them with either an Android or iOS device, Nreal says you’ll get the best experience with a OnePlus 8 or recent Samsung Galaxy phone — both of which Verizon will happily sell you.</p><p>We got our first look at the Light mixed reality glasses at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-sunglasses-hands-on.html">CES 2019</a>. The primary focus of the device is on entertainment and productivity applications. Nreal&#39;s Nebula software allows you to access your phone&#39;s Android apps without taking the glasses off. You can also use them as makeshift VR glasses, but the 52-degree diagonal field of view is limited compared to a dedicated headset.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">793b4827-e2a1-4718-87d7-795a306ff49f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 14:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637197979</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T01:13:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4cbe5e60-480a-11ec-abff-307c102e7f8b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4cbe5e60-480a-11ec-abff-307c102e7f8b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nreal]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nreal Light]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nreal Light]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
