For those who&#39;ve been mostly dependent on their phones instead of their keycards, that means being locked out of their vehicles. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/19/tesla-suffers-nationwide-app-server-outage-owners-cant-connect-cars/"><em>Electrek</em></a> first reported the issue after receiving complaints from Tesla owners on Friday night, and for a while it seemed like the problem only affected drivers in North America. But then, an owner from Seoul, South Korea tweeted at Elon Musk about getting a server error on their app, to which the Tesla CEO replied that he&#39;s &quot;checking&quot; it out.</p><div id="8610b9194965476c8378cee72aaa84e7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Checking …</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1461807570138640387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Other tweets show owners <a href="https://twitter.com/zakiefer00/status/1461832841298427915">calling</a> for roadside assistance and <a href="https://twitter.com/anelectricqueen/status/1461824157373681675">delaying</a> their plans for the night. The outage came shortly after the automaker rolled out an update to its application, which <em>Electrek</em> said includes a feature that Tesla had issues implementing. It&#39;s unclear if that was connected to the outage, since Musk has yet to follow up on his initial response. Regardless, it looks like the outage is starting to get resolved. <a href="https://downdetector.com/status/tesla/">Downdetector</a> received as many as 543 reports a few hours ago, but now they&#39;re down to less than a hundred.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Being locked out of vehicles could be an ongoing problem as automakers move to cloud services and increase reliance on smartphone apps.

In a complaint with the state’s Superior Court in Alameda County, Jessica Barraza, a production associate with Tesla, said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions over the past three years. Barraza’s lawsuit describes a factory floor that looks more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of advanced EV production.</p><p>Barraza’s allegations against Tesla are numerous. In one incident, the suit alleges a male co-worker stuck his leg between her thighs when she went to punch in after a lunch break. Amid the harassment, Barraza says her complaints fell on deaf ears. In one instance, she says a supervisor did nothing when she complained of a co-worker staring at her breasts. “Maybe you shouldn’t wear shirts that draw attention to your chest,” her supervisor told her, according to the suit. Barraza told the man she was “wearing a work shirt provided by Tesla.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“After almost three years of experiencing all the harassment, it robs your sense of security — it almost dehumanizes you,” Barraza said in an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/19/tesla-sexual-harassment/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, which was the first outlet to report on the suit. We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment. The company does not typically respond to media requests.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit comes one month after Tesla was ordered by a federal court to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">pay $137 million to a Black employee</a> who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at its Fremont factory.  “We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns,” the company said at the time. “Occasionally, we’ll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.” Tesla is appealing the award.</p><p>Tesla also isn’t the only EV-maker accused of fostering a toxic workplace for women. Just days before its IPO, Rivian was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">sued by Laura Schwab, one of its former executives</a>. In her lawsuit, Schwab alleges the automaker fired her after she complained of a “toxic ‘bro culture’” that saw her excluded from meetings and more. “The culture at Rivian was actually the worst I’ve experienced in over 20 years in the automotive industry,” Schwab said at the time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-sexual-harassment-suit-185934119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9aca2d5-639f-445a-b833-2c243cb35f2a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637349236</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T19:13:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla vehicle drives past Tesla's primary vehicle factory after CEO Elon Musk announced he was defying local officials' coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions by reopening the plant in Fremont, California, U.S. May 11, 2020.

The last decade-plus has seen Apple’s computers become essentially impossible for users to service or upgrade, and the iPhone has always been a locked box. Adventurous owners might follow <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928">guides from iFixit</a> to try and do repairs themselves, but it’s a dangerous proposition. Remember, it was just earlier this year, when we discovered that replacing the display on an iPhone 13 would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-face-id-third-party-replacement-215624361.html">disable Face ID</a>. (Apple later backpedaled on this.)</p><p>So Apple’s announcement earlier this week that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">start selling parts and tools directly to consumers </a>and offer repair guides was a huge surprise, and a move immediately hailed as a victory by right-to-repair activists. “One of the most visible opponents to repair access is reversing course,” <a href="https://mailchi.mp/9af21ee3e564/statement-apple-concedes-to-right-to-repair-movement-reverses-ban-on-selling-parts-to-consumers?e=767d7cbbfe">said Nathan Proctor</a>, a senior Right to Repair campaign director at Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG). “Apple’s move shows that what repair advocates have been asking for was always possible.” iFixit was similarly pleased, saying that the move is “exactly the right thing for Apple to be doing.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both groups caveated their statements by noting a few catches. PIRG says that Apple’s plans weren’t as comprehensive as the right-to-repair legislation being discussed in more than two dozen states, while iFixit wants to “analyze the legal terms and test the program” before it can say just how much credit Apple deserves. But regardless, it’s still a major about-face. So what led Apple to this move?</p><p>Proctor told Engadget in an email exchange that he thinks “combined pressure from consumers, regulators and shareholders has shifted Apple&#39;s thinking.” But he was also quick to point out that there was pressure coming from inside Apple itself. “We saw from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair">some leaked emails</a> from 2019 that many inside Apple never wanted to be hostile to repair in the ways that Apple has been at times,” he said. You probably saw that [Apple co-founder Steve] Wozniak called [out] the practices, but leaked emails show internal concern they were doing the wrong thing.”</p><p>Apple has made some other movies recently that show that potential government scrutiny and oversight could be driving change at the company. In 2020, Apple finally let users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">set different browser and email apps</a> as default on the iPhone and iPad, and Siri has gotten smarter about learning your preferences for different music apps when you ask it to play tunes.</p><p>While it’s likely that Apple is thinking about government pressure, this change might also simply be part of the company listening to its users and correcting some mistakes it made over the last five years or so. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">Take the new MacBook Pro</a>, perhaps the biggest “mea culpa” Apple has ever offered: The company reversed its trend of pursuing thin and light design at all costs and instead actually made the both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros thicker and heavier than their predecessors. The company also added back ports it had previously removed, killed the unpopular Touch Bar, and generally made a laptop that made it seem like they were listening to consumer feedback. The same could be said for its new home repair program.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/413d2f90-ca89-11e9-a1be-2ec8d17a9f7d" alt="A worker refurbishes an Apple Iphone cell phone at a workshop of the Oxflo company, specialised in refurbishment of broken European smartphones which will be resold and provided with a warranty as part of an eco-responsible approach, in Lusignac, France, June 20, 2019. REUTERS/ Regis Duvignau" data-uuid="a3bb151b-d2db-3e0d-bd23-83ba5e5d2857"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Regis Duvignau / Reuters</div></figure><p>Apple’s move this week can also be seen as an extension of a program the company launched last year, when it started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-verifies-mac-repair-shops-144422765.html">providing parts and training to third-party repair shops</a> that met Apple’s qualifications. Obviously, this isn’t the same as making it easy for anyone to do repairs, but opening up access means the repair landscape for Apple products has changed significantly in the last few years.</p><p>However big of a change this new plan is, though, Proctor and PIRG see this as a first step, something Apple will need to keep up and expand to really deliver what right-to-repair activists think consumers deserve. “I think Right to Repair knows what it wants, and it will be really hard to convince us to settle for anything less than an open market for repair,” Proctor said. “If they had done this step years ago, maybe we would have to settle, but we have the momentum, and we are going to empower repair as much as we can. I think most legislators agree: This is just one company and a limited program. The floor got raised, but we aren&#39;t near the ceiling yet.”</p><p>iFixit has a similar view on the situation. “[Apple] pioneered glued-in batteries and proprietary screws, and now they are taking the first steps on a path back to long-lasting, repairable products. iFixit believes that a sustainable, repairable world of technology is possible, and hope that Apple follows up on this commitment to improve their repairability.”</p><p>As for what’s to come, it sounds like Apple is committed to making this just a first step. The company said that repair options would initially focus on commonly-repaired modules in the iPhone 12 and 13, like the screen, battery and cameras, but it says that more options will come in the following year. We don’t know if Apple will ever give right-to-repair activists everything they want. It seems unlikely that Apple will make an iPhone where you can just pop it open and drop a new battery in, like the phones of old.</p><p>Apple can often be a bellwether for the rest of the industry — just look how quickly other phone-makers dropped their headphone jacks. So, it’s possible we’ll see some other big consumer electronics companies make similar moves. “I think other companies will follow,” Proctor said.

The IP68-rated device has a 6.7-inch, 3,216 x 1,440 screen with brightness of up to 1,300 nits and a 120Hz maximum refresh rate.

The array can shoot 8K video at 30fps, but we had reservations about the telephoto lens, which sometimes overexposed images in scenarios with a lot of light.</p><p>The device is powered by a Snapdragon 888 processor, which is plenty capable.

Per the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article255941562.html"><em>Miami Herald</em></a>, city commissioners voted on Thursday to end a multi-year pilot that had allowed companies like Bird and Lime to operate shared scooter rentals within the city’s core. Those companies now have until 5PM on Friday, November 19th, to collect their electric scooters. If they don’t comply in time, the city will impound the vehicles.</p><p>“We’re shutting it down,” Commissioner Alex Díaz de la Portilla told the outlet. “That’s it.” Like in many other cities across the US and other parts of the world, electric scooters were a source of controversy in Miami. Supporters claimed they were an effective solution for last-mile travel, while detractors said they made city sidewalks unsafe. It’s that latter point of view that swayed the commission’s vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“On Biscayne Boulevard, at whatever hour of the day, you see kids on these scooters,” said Commissioner Díaz de la Portilla. “This is an accident waiting to happen.” Ken Russell, the lone commissioner who voted against ending the program, pointed out it had been a revenue generator for the city. Miami had earned approximately $2.4 million through the pilot program, and it had used that money to fund new bike lanes.</p><p>The vote caught the scooter companies off guard. “We’re extremely disappointed in the Commission’s hasty and short-sighted action to end the scooter program, taking away a safe and popular transportation option used by thousands of Miami residents daily and putting dozens of workers out of a job the week before Thanksgiving,” said Caroline Samponaro, vice president of transit, bike and scooter policy at Lyft, in a statement shared with Engadget.</p><p>As the <em>Miami Herald</em> points out, there is a chance scooters could return to Miami. City staff are drafting rules that would allow rental companies to bid for a contract to operate in the city as part of a permanent program. But based on the fact the Miami City Commission would need to vote to authorize such a program, it’s not clear if there’s enough support.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miami-ends-electric-scooter-pilot-program-165747077.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a06bd24-1cb2-4d74-b89b-d3976ab590d2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:02:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637341145</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T16:59:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6e5f3570-c377-11eb-bbf3-d188c20955cf" width="8560" height="5707" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6e5f3570-c377-11eb-bbf3-d188c20955cf" width="8560" height="5707" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nisian Hughes via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of South Beach Miami Florida cityscape with buildings along the beach on a beautiful sunny day, people on beach and ocean]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of South Beach Miami Florida cityscape]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bose's QuietComfort 45 headphones drop to $279, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re officially one week out from Black Friday and it seems most retailers have launched at least a portion of their deals and sales already.

There are exceptions for some free-to-play games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. In addition, members often get discounts on digital purchases through the PlayStation Store, as well as cloud storage and backups for game save files.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the major value adds of PS Plus is that players receive a mystery bag of a few games each month across PS4 and PS5. There are three extra PS VR games <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/28/playstation-plus-games-for-november-knockout-city-first-class-trouble-kingdoms-of-amalur-re-reckoning/">this month</a> to mark the headset’s fifth anniversary. You’ll retain access to claimed PS Plus games as long as you maintain your subscription.</p><p>PS5 owners can take advantage of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-free-games-210040338.html">the PS Plus Collection</a> too. It’s a selection of first-party and third-party PS4 games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ps5-optimization-patch-214349294.html">some of which</a> have been patched for better performance on PS5. The lineup includes <em>God of War</em>, <em>Monster Hunter: World</em>, <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, <em>Uncharted 4: A Thief&#39;s End</em>, <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>, <em>Days Gone</em>, <em>Battlefield 1</em>, <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>, <em>The Last Guardian</em>, <em>The Last of Us Remastered</em>, <em>Persona 5</em> and <em>Resident Evil 7</em>. The same rule applies: if your PS Plus subscription lapses, you won’t be able to play games you claimed through the collection.</p><p>Of course, given that this is the biggest shopping season of the year, there are discounts on games as well, and many of the better deals are for physical editions. You can find savings on PlayStation console exclusives like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a> (<a href="https://fave.co/30ByLVw">$25</a> at GameStop if you click &#39;New&#39; and <a href="https://amzn.to/30DrwwP">$30</a> at Amazon, usually $60), the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html">director&#39;s cut</a> of <em>Ghost of Tsushima </em>on PS5 (down from $70 to <a href="https://amzn.to/3CxWQtM">$50</a>), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/demons-souls-ps5-remake-gameplay-trailer-212138725.html"><em>Demon&#39;s Souls</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(also reduced by $30 to <a href="https://amzn.to/3oGsH6x">$40</a>) and, in one of the bigger discounts, <em>Returnal, </em>which has dropped from $70 to <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=BF-Returnal&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FReturnal-PlayStation-5%2F721660344">$30</a>.</p><p>There are good deals on multi-platform titles too, such as Eidos-Montreal&#39;s surprisingly wonderful <a href="https://www.engadget.com/guardians-galaxy-game-preview-marvel-square-enix-130003598.html"><em>Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a>, which is half off at <a href="https://amzn.to/3HEBf6H">$30</a> on all platforms. <a href="https://amzn.to/3FzkPub"><em>Hitman 3</em></a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/DVO7by"><em>Resident Evil: Village</em></a> are both less than half price at the minute at $20. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hades/"><em>Hades</em></a>, which is widely regarded as one of the best games of 2020, is also <a href="https://amzn.to/3CyVdvV">$20</a> on all platforms.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Far%20Cry%206/"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a> is a third off at <a href="https://amzn.to/3nwlQ04">$40</a>, and you can save on <em>FIFA 22</em> as well. The latest edition of EA&#39;s famed soccer series is $40 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3r7Iher">PS5</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2Z2JBn0">Xbox Series X/S</a> (it&#39;s a digital code for the latter consoles), and $28 on <a href="https://amzn.to/3FxavTK">PS4</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/32hu9EV">Xbox One</a>.</p><p>The PS5 digital edition and Xbox Series X don&#39;t have disc drives, so deals on physical games won&#39;t mean much to owners of those consoles. However, it&#39;s worth checking out the PlayStation and Xbox digital stores for Black Friday deals there too.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

You can grab the cans for $248 right now, or more than $100 off their normal price. If you prefer earbuds, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:WF-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/3klnjo7">WF-1000XM4</a> have been discounted for a bit and remain down to $248 as well.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30a6jtt" id="714539abddfa46bc813cc11da4541296" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy WH-1000XM4 at Amazon - $248</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/b3PP9x" id="93aa66cc9e8547888ea58ab27ed16bbf" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy WH-1000XM4 at Best Buy - $248</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3klnjo7" id="ab02e92a8f7f48138fb359718cbd457e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy WF-1000XM4 earbuds at Amazon - $248</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/2ryy9O" id="76db774f257d41038560f5bbae3a5a76" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy WF-1000XM4 earbuds at Best Buy - $248</a><p>All of the key (and stellar) features of the previous WH-1000XM3 are in the latest headphones, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">new model</a> has a few upgrades, too. The design is slightly sleeker and more comfortable, and you&#39;ll get about 30 hours on a single charge so you can wear them for long stretches of time. Sound quality is great with punchy bass, and Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio provides an immersive experience similar to that of Dolby Atmos. Active noise cancellation is also solid and, with Adaptive Sound Control enabled, the headphones will automatically adjust the level of noise cancellation based on your environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate the addition of two new features: multi-device connectivity and Speak to Chat. The former allows you to connect the XM4 to a couple of devices at once, switching between them at will. The latter will automatically pause audio coming from the headphones when it detects you speaking. Most people will likely use the former feature more on a regular basis, but the latter is nice to have, too.</p><p>For those who prefer earbuds, you&#39;ll get many similar features in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4</a>. These earned a score of 86 from us for their excellent sound quality and ANC, improved battery life and wireless charging case. They also have the same Speak-to-Chat feature that the headphones have, even if it can be a bit finicky sometimes. The ANC on these buds is noticeably better than that of their predecessors, and they also support 360 Reality Audio.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Their high price tags can make it hard to be an early adopter without emptying your bank account. But Black Friday sales have come in clutch for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and the Galaxy Z Fold 3 — both are on sale for record-low prices at Amazon right now. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Z Flip 3" href="https://amzn.to/3Fu1kDs">Z Flip 3</a> is $150 off and down to $850 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Z Fold 3" href="https://amzn.to/3x3pilQ">Z Fold 3</a> is $300 off and down to $1,500. Both also come with a free pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Galaxy Buds 2</a> if you apply the promotional offer on the product page before checking out. If you&#39;d rather order directly from Samsung, you can get the same deal on the Z Fold 3 there, but the Z Flip 3 costs an extra $50.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Fu1kDs" id="e6526d31ce0d4ab58354247d5cfbb0f0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Z Flip 3 at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3qSa0iN" id="971457e494b64673b512c3115cbb973a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Z Flip 3 at Samsung - $900</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3x3pilQ" id="617b440c799243289d7cefa184296ed5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Z Fold 3 at Amazon - $1,500</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3qT69ly" id="f63eebde241a40268f9b2ad50af7583e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Z Fold 3 at Samsung - $1,500</a><p>Out of the two, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">Z Flip 3</a> impressed us more, in part because Samsung fixed many of the problems found in its predecessor. While you&#39;ll still notice a crease in its 6.7-inch AMOLED display, it&#39;s not as noticeable as before, and the screen and the device overall seems more durable this time around. The handset doesn&#39;t scratch as easily anymore and it&#39;s IPX8 water resistant, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The main screen runs at 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and is lovely to use, and it supports up to 120Hz refresh rates. When folded, the 1.9-inch external screen displays short bits of information like the weather and calendar events, and it can be used to quickly access certain features like Samsung Pay. We also appreciate the new software features that Samsung built in that are foldable specific such as Flex Mode, which will show things like a a YouTube video on the top half of the display when the device is partially folded and the comments section on the bottom.</p><p>While the Z Flip 3 is both impressive and fairly practical, we found the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Z Fold 3</a> to be remarkable but much less useful. It&#39;s larger and heavier for one, and when closed, it&#39;s narrower than most smartphones, which makes it a bit awkward. Its 7.6-inch AMOLED interior display provides an immersive experience and is more flexible than previous iterations, and we appreciate the S Pen support. But overall, it&#39;s not the best smartphone nor the best small tablet. However, that might not matter to those who are super excited about owning a foldable — and these Black Friday sales make that reality a bit more accessible.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

It&#39;s already illegal to text and make calls behind the wheel unless it&#39;s an emergency. Starting next year, though, any use of mobile phone while driving <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/any-use-of-hand-held-mobile-phone-while-driving-to-become-illegal">will be deemed illegal</a> — that includes using phones to take photos or videos, to play games or to scroll through playlists and other content.&nbsp;</p><p>Drivers can&#39;t do any of those even while their vehicle isn&#39;t moving. The government will revise The Highway Code to explain that being stationary on the road, such as at traffic lights or in the middle of traffic jams, still count as driving. Anybody caught using their phones in those circumstances will still be fined £200 (US$269) and will get six penalty points on their license, which means new drivers could get their licenses <a href="https://www.gov.uk/penalty-points-endorsements/new-drivers">revoked</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The only exception is if they&#39;re using their phone to make payments at a card reader, say at a drive-through window or a road toll. Paying for online shopping purchases isn&#39;t an acceptable reason to get out of being penalized if they&#39;re caught. To note, drivers can continue using their devices hands-free, such as for navigation purposes, so long as they&#39;re secured in a cradle.</p><p>The UK has long been planning to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-bans-all-phone-use-while-driving-195311229.html">close the legal loophole</a> allowing drivers to use their mobile devices, so long as they&#39;re not texting or calling. Authorities <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/expanding-the-offence-of-using-a-hand-held-mobile-phone-while-driving-to-include-non-connected-mobile-application-actions">consulted</a> the public about expanding its existing laws, and 81 percent of responders apparently supported their proposals.</p><p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Too many deaths and injuries occur while mobile phones are being held. By making it easier to prosecute people illegally using their phone at the wheel, we are ensuring the law is brought into the 21st century while further protecting all road users.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-ban-any-handheld-use-mobile-phone-driving-125038275.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">36461dd9-e8f4-4413-8a37-475bfb4d3fa9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 12:50:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637326009</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T12:47:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ab7058c0-492f-11ec-bdff-d1522a5d2f98" width="5200" height="3471" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ab7058c0-492f-11ec-bdff-d1522a5d2f98" width="5200" height="3471" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peter Dazeley via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Texting in car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dangerv texting while driving]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Pressure on Activision Blizzard CEO to resign grows]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We reported on employees calling for Activision Blizzard boss Bobby Kotick’s resignation earlier this week in TMA, but pressure continues to mount.

A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-app-nintendo-switch-190506686.html">Twitch</a> affiliate who&#39;s just starting out, however, used to only have a single custom emote slot. Now, the livestreaming website has upped the initial number of emote slots to five, based on affiliates&#39; feedback. That means streamers can offer five custom emotes from the get-go, simply by meeting the bare requirements needed to become part of the affiliate program. In all, affiliates can earn nine slots for custom emotes by reaching certain subscription milestones.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitch is also carrying the change over to its partner program, increasing the slots available for them, as well. To be able to apply for partner status, an affiliate must reach a certain number of streaming hours, views and subscribers. Even then, they might not get in. That&#39;s why giving potential subscribers more incentive in the form of emotes could help beginners reach their goal sooner and earn more money.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The website has also given affiliates the capability offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-follower-animated-emotes-160026601.html">animated emotes</a> to their community. They&#39;ll start with one slot and can unlock up to five as their audience grows. Those who can&#39;t afford to pay an artist to create animated emotes for them can use the website&#39;s Easy Animate feature to quickly convert static emotes into animated versions for free. These updates have started rolling out to Twitch streamers and will be reaching everyone in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-increases-custom-emotes-affiliates-115056303.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">472b35dc-c600-4a5c-a29a-7cc6dc70453d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 11:50:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637321286</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T11:28:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/18ca0ae0-4923-11ec-bf32-a813b11dac32" width="1280" height="686" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/18ca0ae0-4923-11ec-bf32-a813b11dac32" width="1280" height="686" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Earthworm Jim is set to return in a new TV series]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The cult classic &#39;90s game <em>Earthworm Jim</em> is coming back to TV as a new series, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/earthworm-jim-animated-tv-series-1235114624/"><em>Variety</em></a> and a <a href="https://twitter.com/InterplayGames/status/1461454174525161473">tweet</a> from Interplay Entertainment.

Most packs are on sale, too, so you can grab enough to outfit a good portion of your home and save a decent amount of money while doing so. Also, the wired <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blink Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3oRv8U3">Blink Mini</a> is down to $20 in this sale, which is a record-low price.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3cky99g" id="ae9f9f6cd7e948258778589c4dfe6f2d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Indoor at Amazon - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30DKfYR" id="7e6418631bfb4de1a3f63f1bf833209a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Outdoor at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oRv8U3" id="ee642b3c7e5e4fe2b82a32ad93c77022" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Mini at Amazon - $20</a><p>You only have to decide if you want to put Blink cameras inside or outside your home before you buy them. Aside from the weather resistance on the Outdoor models, the cams are basically the same. Both record 1080p video, have infrared night vision, support two-way audio and send motion alerts to your phone. Two-way audio lets you chat with whomever (or whatever) is on the other end of the camera while motion alerts will keep you posted about any movement the camera&#39;s detect, be it a deliveryman or a rogue bird. Plus, these cameras support Alexa voice commands, so if you have an Echo Show device, you can ask it to show you the video feeds from any of your Blink cameras.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re unsure about going all-in on these cameras, the Blink Mini is a cheap way to try them out first. It&#39;s not wireless like the standard cams, but it has most of the same features and is even more compact. It&#39;ll record in 1080p and it supports two-way audio, motion alerts and Alexa — you&#39;ll just have to make sure you place it close to an outlet in your home.</p><p>Amazon also knocked down the prices of its Eero 6 routers for Black Friday.

They&#39;re already pretty affordable — that&#39;s one of the best things about them — but Black Friday has knocked their prices down even more. Most Fire tablets are on sale right now, including the primary three in the lineup: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire 7" href="https://amzn.to/3qMoBwe">Fire 7</a> is down to $35, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire HD 8" href="https://amzn.to/32c7Xfv">Fire HD 8</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:HD 10" href="https://amzn.to/3qF7lsQ">HD 10</a> are on sale for $45 and $75, respectively. These deals are all the same or better than those we saw during Prime Day back in June — but now you don&#39;t have to be a Prime subscriber to get the discounts.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qMoBwe" id="01f5934e2f9e4cd69b9bb6b072ad5b60" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire 7 at Amazon - $35</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/32c7Xfv" id="646950b1bcab4f7ea05b5cb6fc50c1d8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 8 at Amazon - $45</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qF7lsQ" id="3916d1b9e16f410f938c629fd0bb37c8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 10 at Amazon - $75</a><p>Out of the three, the Fire HD 8 will suit most people well. We gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-hd-8-review-130005977.html">score of 81</a> due in part to its refined design, long battery life and new USB-C charging port. It runs on a quad-core 2.0GHz processor and has up to 64GB of onboard storage, but you can expand it to up to 1TB with a microSD card. It&#39;s a handy device to use on the couch or on the go when you want a larger screen to online shop, check email and even video chat with friends and family. It also may be a better option than a Kindle if you read a lot of graphic novels and manga since it has a full-color 1,280 x 800 display.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re willing to spend a bit more, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-fire-hd-10-tablets-plus-kids-pro-130029307.html">Fire HD 10</a> gives you a number of extra perks. Key among them are a larger, 1,920 x 1,200 display, an octa-core 2.0GHz processor, an extra gigabyte of RAM and an improved rear camera. Those planning on primarily streaming TV shows and movies with the tablet should opt for the bigger HD 10, along with those who don&#39;t want to sacrifice speed and performance even when getting an affordable slab.</p><p>Fire tablets make good kids devices since they have a bunch of parental controls and they cost significantly less than that expensive slab you may have just bought for yourself. You could opt to simply buy one of the above devices for your child, or you can get one of Amazon&#39;s Kids Edition bundles which pair the tablets with a kid-friendly case, a two-year warranty and a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+. All of the Kids devices are on sale right now, too: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire 7 Kids Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3nnaUBY">Fire 7 Kids Pro</a> is down to $60 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire HD 8 Kids Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3FCjLGj">Fire HD 8 Kids Pro</a> has been discounted to $70 and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire HD 10 Kids Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3oBZBFg">Fire HD 10 Kids Pro</a> is on sale for $120.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nnaUBY" id="0f1eab9e295f4c62bd22d091731d6e67" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire 7 Kids Pro at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FCjLGj" id="58b072b7a9f94eb0b571063e8d2fef41" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 8 Kids Pro at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oBZBFg" id="3c9991bd9b1449c4be1b0a48d4c38caf" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 10 Kids Pro at Amazon - $120</a><p>Amazon Kids+ is one of the key benefits to these bundles. The service gives your child access to over 20,000 apps, games, books, audiobooks and more that are age appropriate directly on the tablet. It&#39;s essentially a whole ton of content that parents don&#39;t have to screen beforehand to know if it&#39;s kid-friendly. Just make sure to keep an eye on your subscription because it will renew for the full $3-per-month price after one year. Also, the Kids Pro tablets come with a special digital store in which kids can request apps to download with parental approval.

Like many other companies, Amazon is getting out of the gate a little early with deals on Kindles. The standard Kindle is down from $90 to <a href="https://amzn.to/3HqOPu8">$50</a>, which is the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the e-reader. Back in the summer, it dropped to $55 for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2021-kindle-sales-paperwhite-oasis-094009824.html">Amazon Prime Day</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HqOPu8" id="9814df63ce824e11945fc652d8eb3fc7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $50</a><p>This is the ad-supported version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">the tenth-generation Kindle</a>, which has a 167 ppi glare-free display with a built-in front light. It comes with 8GB of storage, which is enough to store thousands of books. You can also pair it with Bluetooth headphones or speakers to listen to audiobooks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, two Kindles for kids are on sale. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-amazon-kindle-kids-edition.html">Kindle Kids</a> is down to <a href="https://amzn.to/30tmK4X">$60</a> (usually $110) and Kindle Paperwhite Kids, which usually costs $160, has dropped to <a href="https://amzn.to/3DqzGXw">$115</a>, only a couple of months after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-signature-edition-130032095.html">Amazon announced it</a>. Both come with a year of access to Amazon Kids+, a kid-friendly cover and a two-year worry-free guarantee — Amazon will replace the device if it breaks during that period.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30tmK4X" id="61f9664a752e438baee62a146289c080" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle Kids at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DqzGXw" id="632aade4a9b346bea539b800e4cbed74" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle Paperwhite Kids at Amazon - $115</a><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
