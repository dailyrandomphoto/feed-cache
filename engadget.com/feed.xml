On Tuesday, Microsoft said that a group operating out of China was using a zero-day remote code execution to attack SolarWinds software. If successfully exploited, the flaw in the IT company&#39;s Serv-U software allows hackers to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and change data, Microsoft noted in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its investigation, Microsoft said it had observed the hacking group targeting organizations in the US military research and development and software sectors. The company has designated the actor as DEV-0322 in reference to its status as an unidentified &quot;development group.&quot; Microsoft explained that it uses the label prior to reaching high confidence about the origin or identity of a hacker. The group operating out of China is using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers to carry out their attacks, Microsoft said. Those affected have been notified and assisted in their response, the company noted.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SolarWinds <a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211">confirmed</a> on the weekend that it was notified by Microsoft of a security vulnerability in its Serv-U software. The flaw was related to the product&#39;s managed file transfer and secured FTP, which it has since patched.</p><p>SolarWinds gained overnight notoriety in December after it became the subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-treasury-ntia-hacked-194553374.html">supply chain cyberattack</a> that impacted 18,000 of its customers, including nine US government agencies. US intelligence released a joint statement in January naming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-intelligence-agencies-fbi-nsa-cisa-solarwinds-hack-russia-111518166.html">Russia</a> as the most likely source of the hack. The following month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/exclusive-suspected-chinese-hackers-used-184211352.html"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that suspected Chinese hackers had exploited a separate flaw in SolarWinds&#39; software to to help breach US government computers last year. The latest vulnerability is not related to the so-called Sunburst supply chain attack, SolarWinds said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-solarwinds-exploit-china-hack-092547713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cef1d67c-9743-4789-92a1-da0e390dd252</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:25:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626254340</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T09:19:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/411043d0-9fa4-11eb-9ffd-9cadaeb403e2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/411043d0-9fa4-11eb-9ffd-9cadaeb403e2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SUZANNE CORDEIRO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The SolarWinds Corp. logo is seen on a sign at the headquarters in Austin, Texas on April 15, 2021 in Austin, Texas. - The United States announced sanctions against Russia  and the expulsion of 10 diplomats in retaliation for what Washington says is the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity.

The new platform is a way for readers to discover new fiction and a new way for authors to generate revenue from the Kindle Direct Publishing service.&nbsp;</p><p>While the name might suggest otherwise, Kindle Vella isn&#39;t available on Amazon&#39;s Kindle e-readers. Rather, you&#39;ll only find it on Amazon.com or the Kindle iOS app (no Android for now). To start with, the service will be limited to US-based authors who publish stories in English.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The serialized stories will run from 600 to 5,000 words per episode, with the first three offered for free. To see subsequent episodes, you&#39;ll need to pay for &quot;tokens,&quot; with prices ranging from $2 for 200 tokens up to $15 for 1,700 tokens. The latter will give you about 34 episodes, though prices per episode depend on the word count — the more words, the more you&#39;ll have to spend.&nbsp;</p><div id="9ecbe83039b54315bc01663af8a3de80"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjBoQrFgOms?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Authors, meanwhile, will receive 50 percent of the revenue along with bonuses based on engagement with the app&#39;s social media-style features. To that end, readers can follow stories to be notified of new episodes, leave a thumbs up for episodes they like, apply a &quot;Fave&quot; for their favorite story of the week (provided they purchase tokens), and share on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. To boost engagement, authors can speak directly to readers at the end of episodes to &quot;share story insights and behind-the-scenes content,&quot; Amazon wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Amazon opened Vella to authors three months ago, &quot;thousands of authors&quot; have published &quot;tens of thousands of Kindle Vella episodes across dozens of genres and microgenre,&quot; Amazon said. Authors appear to be interested as well. &quot;I’ve published close to 30 novels, and I’m enjoying the adventure of writing <em>The Marriage Auction</em> in this new format,” said bestselling author Audrey Carlan in a statement. Whether or not the format takes off now depends on readers — to try it out, you can access Vella <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkdp.com%2Fkindle-vella&amp;esheet=52458701&amp;newsitemid=20210713006218&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=kdp.com%2FKindle-Vella&amp;index=10&amp;md5=35e4153bc11f4ea71707d449060f3d31">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-launches-its-kindle-vella-serialized-story-platform-085016781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b73e2a4-9353-4813-af8c-53d312d8ddbc</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:50:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626252049</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T08:41:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/240d5a50-e47a-11eb-b6ed-00b27ffe8814" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/240d5a50-e47a-11eb-b6ed-00b27ffe8814" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon launches its Kindle Vella serialized story platform]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon launches its Kindle Vella serialized story platform]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ransomware group REvil disappears from the internet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-linked ransomware group behind some of the biggest recent cyberattacks has disappeared from the internet. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/multiple-revil-ransomware-sites-are-down-on-the-darkweb-.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable-2021-07-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/13/revil-disappears-kaseya-hack/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the websites operated by the group REvil went down in the early hours of Tuesday. Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer of the cyber firm CrowdStrike, told <em>The Post</em> that the group&#39;s blog in the dark web is still reachable. However, its critical sites victims use to negotiate with the group and to receive decryption tools if they pay up are no longer available. Visitors to those websites now see a message that says &quot;A server with the specified hostname could not be found.&quot;</p><p>REvil took responsibility for a recent string of ransomware attacks that affected around 800 to 1,500 businesses worldwide, including schools. It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/05/revil-hackers-behind-massive-ransomware-outbreak-drop-demand-to-50m.html">demanded</a> $70 million to restore the data it stole and encrypted. Before that, experts linked the group to the ransomware attacks on IT management software giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html">Kaseya</a> and beef supplier JBS, which chose to pay US$11 million to get its data back.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s unclear why REvil&#39;s websites aren&#39;t accessible anymore. As <em>Reuters</em> mentioned, ransomware gangs tend to vanish and rebrand in case they attract too much attention. President Biden recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/us/politics/biden-putin-ransomware-russia.html">revealed</a> that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that he expects his government to act on ransomware attacks coming from his country. When asked if the US would attack the servers Russian cybercriminals use to hijack American networks, Biden answered with a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>Alperovitch told <em>The Post</em> that it doesn&#39;t look like REvil&#39;s servers were attacked, which means it&#39;s unlikely a an offensive cyber operation launched by US authorities. Kurtis Minder, the founder of threat intelligence firm GroupSense, told <em>Reuters</em> that <em>if </em>REvil&#39;s sites going down truly was the result of an offensive operation mounted by the US government, he hopes that &quot;collateral damage was a consideration.&quot; Bad actors hold the key to the data they take ransom, and victims would have a tough time recovering theirs if that key gets destroyed or lost.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-revil-disappears-from-the-internet-081251029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d72efb1-5fdd-4e9a-9ed1-c9319e47ff72</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:12:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626250408</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T08:13:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f07de4d0-e46e-11eb-b7ff-8113fc2bc6a7" width="6500" height="3500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f07de4d0-e46e-11eb-b7ff-8113fc2bc6a7" width="6500" height="3500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Just_Super via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fingerprint, Computer, Technology, Cyber Security, Lock, Safe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cybersecurity Digital Technology Security]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter now lets you change who can reply to your tweets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, Twitter introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-reply-limits-to-all-users-173007909.html">some changes</a> that made it easier to choose <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-rethink-replies-180933138.html">how to reply</a> to tweets <em>and</em> to manage who can reply to your tweets.

By the looks of things, Apple could soon offer a similar option to Apple Pay users.

If you pick the “Apple Pay in 4” option, you’ll need to make four interest-free payments across two months. The other option is to extend the payment period over multiple months, though in that case interest comes into play. <em>Bloomberg</em> says it wasn’t able to determine how much interest Apple plans to charge or when the company will roll out the service.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to Apple for comment on the report, and we’ll update this article when we hear back from the company.

Those behind games released on Stadia after October 1st will receive 85 percent of sales revenue, with Google taking a 15 percent cut. The split applies to the first $3 million of sales and will only be in place until the end of 2023. Stadia will return to the current revenue split after that point.</p><p>Starting this month, new titles that join the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/stadia%20pro"><ins>Stadia Pro</ins></a> lineup (the library of games that&#39;s included with a membership) under updated terms will receive a cut of the $10/month subscriptions. Google will share 70 percent of that revenue with publishers and the pool will be divided based on player engagement. Google is using something called &quot;session days&quot; as the key metric. Each separate day that a user hops into a Stadia Pro game counts as a session day — if someone plays a title twice in 24 hours, it still counts as one session day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="533c64bd54394490be5a38ce8cb45998"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0oNK-XHp0I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Google made these announcements during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0oNK-XHp0I"><ins>a Stadia keynote</ins></a> at the Google for Games Summit. It will also introduce a Stadia Pro affiliate program. Developers and/or publishers will receive $10 for every user who accesses Stadia through their Click to Play link and goes on to become a paid Stadia Pro subscriber after their one-month trial. The idea is to give developers and publishers an incentive to promote their Stadia Pro games wherever users can click on a link. This program will get underway early next year.</p><p>Although all of these changes will benefit developers and publishers, it&#39;s perhaps the 85/15 revenue split that will be most enticing. As with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-small-business-program-15-percent-112259064.html"><ins>lower revenue cut</ins></a> Apple takes from the first $1 million per year of App Store sales, the move could mostly beneficial for indie studios and publishers, though those who&#39;ve already published games on Stadia will miss out on the deal.</p><p>Still, this approach might work for Stadia. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-25-steam-epic-games-store-revenue-share-sweeney-challenge.html"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-pc-rev-share-88-12-epic-apple-130036485.html"><ins>Xbox PC store</ins></a> take a 12 percent slice of sales, while Steam and consoles&#39; digital storefronts typically siphon off 30 percent.</p><p>It&#39;s been a turbulent few months for Stadia. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-game-studios-shut-down-montreal-los-angeles-201811811.html"><ins>shut down</ins></a> its internal game studios in February, turning Stadia into a game streaming platform for third-party titles only. Meanwhile, Stadia product chief John Justice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stadia-product-head-john-justice-leaves-google-121048599.html"><ins>left the company</ins></a> in May.

Spotted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/apple-releases-magsafe-battery-pack-for-iphone-12-available-now-for-99/"><em><ins>9to5Mac</ins></em></a>, the new accessory costs $99, with deliveries beginning early next week. Instead of a case you put on your iPhone, this latest battery pack attaches to the back of your device.&nbsp;</p><p>The accessory is available in a single size that features a 1,460mAh battery, meaning it can’t change any model in the iPhone 12 family to full. When using the battery pack on the go, it will charge your phone at about 5 watts. Plugging it into a power adapter while it’s still attached to your iPhone will increase that speed to about 15 watts. Either way, it’s not the fastest way to top up an iPhone 12, but it should still help in a pinch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5b4363b0-e403-11eb-a5cf-382c740f2190" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="MagSafe Battery Pack" data-uuid="915f42e0-0313-3b91-9f26-2015cc009e9d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>According to an official <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"><ins>support document</ins></a>, you need iOS 14.7 to use the battery pack. Apple has yet to release that update. The company also recommends using a 20 watt or higher USB-C power adapter and USB-C to Lightning cable for charging the device.</p><p>When it’s attached to your iPhone, you’ll see how much power it has left to give on the battery widget you can add to your Home Screen and Today View. Interestingly, Apple also notes you may get a notification from your device that the accessory won’t charge it past 90 percent. You can bypass that limit enabling by low power mode through the Control Center.</p><p>Apple isn’t the first company to offer a battery pack that attaches magnetically to the iPhone 12 and its siblings. However, after Amazon<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/21/technology/amazons-great-purge.html"><ins> removed many of the most popular brands</ins></a> on its marketplace earlier in the year, those have been harder to find. And if you visit the website now, you’ll find that many of the battery packs listed don’t have an estimated availability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-175601349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">00eebed9-2886-4bef-bfd2-ed4bff478e6a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 17:56:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626198966</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T17:56:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ and HBO Max earn their first best comedy Emmy nominations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20tv+">Apple TV+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hbo%20max">HBO Max</a> have picked up their first nominations in the top two Primetime Emmy categories.

And gasoline.</p><p>Stood on stage, with the two arm jets resting on a frame in front of me, the team finishes teaching me the fundamentals of movement: Use your right-hand trigger to adjust thrust, spread uniformly across the three jets; raise your hands to go back, bring them behind you to go forward; raise just one to rotate in that direction. Someone tapped my back and I realized I was now attached to a safety wire that ran across the very top of the stage.</p><p>And that was it. An engineer put a pair of ear protectors on me — I had a big heavy engine on each wrist  — and withdrew to a safe distance. Then the engines kicked in, and I immediately realized why I had ear protectors.</p><p>These engines can roar. Collectively, they have enough power to lift up to 210 pounds, but the Gravity Industries team gently increased the engine power, meaning I could literally find my feet, moonhopping from side to side, feeling the effects of different angles on the arm thrusters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2b48470-e3df-11eb-bff9-45b0af645f88" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="a05af733-7210-35b8-b0af-d4ffd755f91b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>Keeping my arms straight not only kept these roaring engines away from me, but made it easy to stay rigid and adjust the shape of my body.  Finally, my brief dalliance with gymnastic rings was paying off. As the power was stepped up, Browning (who was apparently commentating on my efforts to a crowd of spectators — I couldn’t hear him) flagged me and I powered down the motors. I hadn’t quite got off the ground for more than a few seconds at a time. He explained that I could guide where I went by looking (and turning my head) in that direction, like how you control the direction of your snowboard. I followed his hand as he walked from one side of the stage to the other, and the jetsuit was doing what I wanted it to.</p><p>Gravity Industries’ jetsuit is designed so that intuition kicks in pretty soon. We naturally raise our hands when we fall. Feel like you’re falling here, and the same gesture will keep you upright. At the same time, intuition can also mess you up. With a powerful engine strapped to your back, pointing at the floor, you should not kick your legs back. Or flail them when you panic. The stream isn’t going to flambé your legs, but you’ll feel a wave of heat that doesn’t exactly help to calm you down.</p><p>After the flailing, I’d run out of fuel, and it was time for a refill. Once topped up, and with a little more confidence, I stepped onto the stage. The engineers cranked up the power a little bit more, and I tried to hold my nerve. The engines were roaring louder than ever, and I managed to, finally, lift myself off the stage. I turned, I wobbled, I moved backwards, forwards and landed when I felt like landing. Did I feel like I was six feet off the ground? Yes. Was it really only a foot and change? Yes.</p><div id="669d8398c7e0414db9f7313263df9f0e"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="13" style="background:#FFF;border:0;margin:1px;max-width:658px;min-width:326px;padding:0;width:99.375%;"><div style="padding:16px;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="background:#FFFFFF;padding:0 0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%;" target="_blank"><div style="display:flex;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:40px;margin-right:14px;width:40px;"></div><div style="display:flex;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:100px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:60px;"></div></div></div><div style="padding:19% 0;"></div><div style="display:block;height:50px;margin:0 auto 12px;width:50px;"></div><div style="padding-top:8px;"><div style="color:#3897f0;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;"> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div style="padding:12.5% 0;"></div><div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:14px;"><div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;margin-right:14px;margin-left:2px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12.5px;width:12.5px;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:8px;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:20px;width:20px;"></div><div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:2px solid transparent;border-left:6px solid #f4f4f4;border-bottom:2px solid transparent;"></div></div><div style="margin-left:auto;"><div style="width:0px;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-right:8px solid transparent;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:12px;width:16px;"></div><div style="width:0;height:0;border-top:8px solid #F4F4F4;border-left:8px solid transparent;"></div></div></div><div style="display:flex;margin-bottom:24px;"><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;margin-bottom:6px;width:224px;"></div><div style="background-color:#F4F4F4;height:14px;width:144px;"></div></div></a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;white-space:nowrap;"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRElVWal97W/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration:none;" target="_blank">A post shared by Mat Smith (@thtmtsmth)</a></p></div></blockquote></div><p>Earlier this month, on Independence Day, Mark Zuckerberg published a video of him atop an electric surfboard — if not jetpack — holding the United States flag as he was propelled across the water’s surface. The very, very weird clip raises the question with a lot of these bleeding-edge transport concepts: are they simply play-things of the rich-and-famous?</p><p>Gravity Industries, as well as US rivals like <a href="https://jetpackaviation.com/">Jetpack Aviation</a> offer “experience days” for groups that include training with the jetsuit and a tour of the company’s research facilities.<a href="https://gravity.co/flight-experience"> These cost a few thousand dollars</a>. You can also register for dedicated flight training, which is even more money. Tapping into enthusiastic early adopters does offer the funding needed to evolve these projects, and fuel is expensive — so are these jetsuits. But beyond day trips for the rich and showing off the suit to Tom Cruise, what are they for?</p><p>The immediate example might be military uses. The military is often the first to adopt new technologies, willingly funding many innovations that have dripped down to civilian life. Browning mentions how helicopters once subverted military strategy when first introduced, with the ability to drop off fully-equipped soldiers into packed jungles changing the assumptions of modern warfare.</p><p>Jetpacks are, for now, noisy, fuel-hungry and vulnerable, however. But the posit is that they could offer an entirely different paradigm in warfare — one not yet imagined (or perhaps affordable) just yet.</p><div id="0ac7a6cb91f24181b78598f02e055d99"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/suHOLFhbwsM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The British Royal Marines have already tested out Gravity Industries’ suit as an alternative to rappelling from helicopters. In the test, one soldier launched from a boat, landed on a larger vessel and lowered the ladder to the rest of his squadron, cutting out the need for a bigger helicopter.</p><p>It’s not all warfare, however. In a recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-ambulance-services-are-testing-jet-suit-paramedic-recoveries-124052727.html">experiment with the UK’s Great North Air Ambulance Service</a> (GNAAS), Browning flew to a simulated casualty in a mountainous area in just 90 seconds, far faster than the 25 minutes it took air ambulance medics to make it on foot. The time reduction could literally save lives, if a solution to the high-cost and learning curve can be found. The suit is also limited by how far it can fly before needing more fuel. It can typically run for around 5-10 minutes, depending on the pilot’s weight and other factors. Like drone deliveries, for now, jetsuits can only offer last-mile movement — and it has to be less than a mile.</p><p>Before the pandemic locked down travel pretty much everywhere, Gravity Industries was also mere weeks away from holding its first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzHWSqMdo1I">race event</a> in Bermuda. It would involve two racers flying around a circuit mixed with an obstacle course built over water, competing for the fastest time. It sounds like something out of <em>The Running Man</em>.</p><p>I’ve watched most of the clips of Gravity Industries’ YouTube channel, and Browning’s other appearances on TV shows. But seeing someone with skill put the jetsuit through its paces,  that’s when I got the appeal of someone flying around that <em>wasn’t</em> me.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d288b980-e3df-11eb-bdef-84cc44c36f05" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="804d19f9-8d60-3173-bcb4-822b3dbb331d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>He finishes addressing the crowd at Goodwood and drops his mic behind a couple of loudspeakers. He steps to the middle of the stage, no safety line, and blasts upwards about three feet. He glides off the stage to the grass between it and the crowd. He punches the thrust harder, going even higher, and takes a tour around the perimeter of the stage. Blades of grass fly around, the engines roaring so loud that it’s hard for the audience to choose between Instagramming this spectacle or plugging their ears with their fingers. He makes another loop, then gingerly lands, center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone around claps, passersby ask Gravity Industries staff if there’s any chance of them trying the jetsuit at the show. They’re politely told that the slots are fully booked, and nudged towards the test flight sessions they offer online.</p><p>At the event, Gravity Industries also revealed what could be the future of something that’s already a near-future concept: a prototype electric jetpack. It was a surprise, given that Future Lab is sponsored by BP, the multinational oil and gas company, or perhaps that’s exactly why there was a non-fossil fuel project to show off.</p><p>This bigger model, with rougher edges, is more prototype than the gasoline models. Following the reveal, Richard Browning tells me that it was really to prove that “we can get someone off the ground.”</p><p>The challenges of an electric jetpack make gasoline versions seem easy. Gravity Industries’ electric proof-of-concept weighs twice that of the fuel iteration, yet it can only last for 10 to 15 seconds of “getting one of the lightest team members off the ground,” notes Browning.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5e6a62d9f5e24cd0a25695d92ba57db2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack"></section><p>The big challenge is the same faced by electric cars, or even smartphones: the limits of lithium batteries. Fortunately, this small company isn’t the only one chasing smaller, lighter, more potent batteries. With electric vehicles now mainstream, the progress in high-capacity batteries will almost certainly continue, if not accelerate.</p><p>There’s the design of the electric jetsuit itself, with almost oversized arm funnels in comparison to the gasoline originals. Browning explains that the electric version is effectively “blowing with fans” and so to get the thrust necessary, you need more air expelled and bigger fans to do so.</p><p>Browning explains that with fuel-powered engines, you benefit from explosively expanding gases — it’s easier to get the thrust needed. With electrics, you have to make all of that thrust yourself. “The bigger the fan you get, the less power needed.” It’s why helicopters have those huge rotor blades. “The smaller you make it, the more work it needs to do and the less efficient it gets,” he added. Still, even at this early stage, an electric setup could work well for training future jetsuit pilots. First-timers like myself were attached to a safety wire above ourselves — this could also be a power tether. For now, though, it’s a glimpse at a possible future for jetpacks — one that doesn’t demand fossil fuels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2aac070-e3df-11eb-b95b-4cb102d09a89" alt="Gravity Industries jetpack" data-uuid="5424ee21-3ab1-3b8d-96ea-866ff368d85a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/ Engadget</div></figure><p>Gravity Industries’ jetsuits are exciting, whether you’re in one or watching someone pilot one. They’re also real, with several paths that could offer a more significant impact. It’s hard to tell which one though, which may be why, for now, the company is letting journalists flail in the air rather than signing deals with the US Army.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gravity-industries-jet-suit-test-impressions-future-lab-festival-of-speed-160009551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50b59790-8d29-4d90-bd42-c2a405fb8a9d</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626194548</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T16:42:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2a51b20-e3df-11eb-abff-d5649e9da15f" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/ Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gravity Industries jetpack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Gravity Industries jetpack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bethesda PS5 exclusive 'Ghostwire: Tokyo' is delayed until early 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tango-gameworks-reveals-gameplay-for-its-supernatural-thriller-ghostwire-210140591.html"><em><ins>Ghostwire: Tokyo</ins></em></a>, the upcoming PlayStation 5 and PC game from Bethesda studio Tango Gameworks, has been delayed to early 2022.

However, the disappearance of 3.5mm ports on mobile devices has left many players bereft of premium audio — Bluetooth earbuds don’t quite cut it when you need your audio synced perfectly. If you want a rock-solid connection your best bet is an RF dongle, which usually uses USB-A in a world steadily being overtaken by USB-C ports. Razer has finally stepped up with a mobile-first headset that can connect to your Switch, Android phone or thin-and-light laptop, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$100 Barracuda X" href="https://fave.co/3keldHa">$100 Barracuda X</a>.</p><p>The Barracuda X is far from the first headset geared toward Nintendo Switch players; we’re big fans of SteelSeries’ <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Arctis 1 Wireless" href="https://amzn.to/3hSEH1o">Arctis 1 Wireless</a> thanks to its comfort and superb audio quality, and have even included it in a few of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-gifts-for-graduates-150047802.html">gift guides</a>. It’s fair to say that this headset is the Barracuda’s primary competitor. Even the RF adapters look the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b66708f0-e340-11eb-955c-31787a3eebd2" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="b37cc66e-5fbd-3a5d-a0a7-3027ed3d0f6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>However, while the Arctis 1 Wireless maintains the standard look of the line (as it should — it’s a great design), the Barracuda is a change of pace for Razer. Instead of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Kraken line" href="https://fave.co/3AODgd2">Kraken brand’s</a> circular, grated look, the new headset resembles last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-opus-headphones-review-150005344.html">Opus headphones</a>, which got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-opus-x-headphones-anc-preorder-171015484.html">refresh</a> last month. It’s not totally identical, with different joints on the cups, and cloth ear padding instead of fake leather. Here in New York, it’s 90 degrees as of this writing, and I can report that I haven’t felt the need to take off the Barracuda even after wearing it for a few hours. It’s still a bit warm, and I definitely feel cooler when I take the headset off, but it’s bearable.</p><p>The Barracuda X also weighs a very scant 250 grams, one of the lightest headsets I’ve tested. (I think it might be lighter than its own packaging.) In direct comparison it feels about the same in hand as similar models from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Turtle Beach Recon Spark" href="https://amzn.to/3k9TcAq">Turtle Beach</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech G733" href="https://amzn.to/2ViusM4">Logitech</a>, but there’s a balance in the Barracuda’s plastic build that makes it feel more ethereal. It’s not something I would mind keeping on my head for several hours or throwing it in my backpack so I can game on the train. Which is precisely the point: You shouldn’t feel that carrying this thing around is a burden.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b67f72f0-e340-11eb-a7ff-774ee8f8438b" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="aa7f41ef-d07e-3019-96a1-67f15b89f77a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>While I wouldn’t go tossing this thing around casually in a rage, it does feel solidly built, capable of taking a few dings in your bag. I have mixed feelings about the detachable mic; being able to take it off means a more compact headset design, but it’s also another fiddly bit that I might lose. Then again, it’s unlikely you need voice functions while out and about. (Heck, the Switch console doesn’t even have real voice chat; it asks you to connect via the app on your phone.)</p><p>The Barracuda X excites me, mostly because of its USB-C compatibility. But that’s also where it falls short for me. The adapter is small, for sure, but it’s very wide. That means that if you happen to have a laptop with two USB-C ports next to each other like my 2017 MacBook, the Barracuda dongle will block the other completely. This is a hassle in my office setup, where I have an external monitor and USB hub connected on the other side. So while working I get to choose between the power cord and the headset. I’ve opted out of using the Barracuda with my laptop at all, preferring instead to listen to podcasts on my phone. However, that’s my unique situation, and on the go you might only need two ports: one for the headset and the other for power.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b712d950-e340-11eb-a7bb-bbf19f27fc87" alt="Razer Barracuda X in black on a field of comic images" data-uuid="15f4da74-8dc0-331a-b662-6ad9a5df2223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s exciting to see companies finally start to take mobile gaming seriously, and address the specific needs those gamers have. Mobile-friendly controllers are great, but many popular mobile games don’t really need them. Better audio, though? Almost everyone can appreciate that.

Once activated, the footage captured by those doorbells is only viewable on the user’s enrolled mobile device, reducing the ability for third parties to see the clips. The news follows the rollout of a US-only technical preview from the start of the year, although it remains limited to the more premium versions of Ring’s connected doorbells.</p><p>At the same time, the company is rolling out support for third-party authentication apps for two-step verification. Similarly, users will now be greeted by CAPTCHAs when logging in to both the Ring app and Neighbors in order to further deter malicious types from trying to gain access. Plus, Ring is making it easier for you to sell your doorbell on by automating the system to transfer hardware within the app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move comes shortly after the company announced a shift in how it dealt with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-request-for-assistance-posts-100025122.html">requests for footage</a> from law enforcement agencies. Rather than the previous system, officials now have to ask users in the vicinity of an incident to submit footage via a public feed. It comes in the wake of news that the company has partnerships with more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">2,000 fire and police departments</a>, and that its Neighbors app was briefly publishing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-exposed-precise-locations-171635602.html">precise locations</a> of people’s homes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-doorbell-end-to-end-encryption-133046912.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79e814cb-2b30-4c34-bbb6-df761906cae7</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626184833</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T14:00:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/10180050-e3bb-11eb-bdfb-aadd6cfdddde" width="3300" height="2207" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/10180050-e3bb-11eb-bdfb-aadd6cfdddde" width="3300" height="2207" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HAMILTON, VA - AUGUST 19: The Ring Video Doorbell is seen outside the Lauterette home on Wednesday August 19, 2015 in Hamilton, VA.

Amazon is selling the 64GB <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pixel 4" href="https://amzn.to/3wGq6LD">Pixel 4</a> for just <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$400" href="https://amzn.to/3wGq6LD">$400</a>, with B&amp;H Photo <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:matching" href="https://fave.co/3AWdsvu">matching</a> that price. That&#39;s an all-time low for the former flagship, and makes it more affordable than a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a 5G</a> — worth considering if processing power matters more than the latest wireless technology.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Amazon - $400" href="https://amzn.to/3wGq6LD">Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Amazon - $400</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at B&amp;H - $400" href="https://fave.co/3AWdsvu">Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at B&amp;H - $400</a></p><p>You can also buy the 128GB version at a discount on both sites, although B&amp;H currently offers a better deal at $430 versus Amazon&#39;s $470.</p><p>There are some caveats. The Pixel 4 is nearly two years old, so it won&#39;t get many more Android updates (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a> is one of them). Battery life and screen brightness are strictly so-so. And Google&#39;s Motion Sense gesture feature never really panned out — it&#39;s a nice bonus, but not something you&#39;ll likely use on a daily basis.</p><p>In return, though, this might be a better value than the current Pixel 4a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">and 5</a> models, especially with the premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">Pixel 6</a> series likely on the horizon. You&#39;re getting a reasonably quick device with a smooth display and still-great cameras for as much or less than slower, typically less capable phones. So long as you can live with the quirks, it might deliver a better overall experience.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-amazon-bh-131509963.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b9ca42b-60e9-49e3-bf42-57d18e716918</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 13:15:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626182059</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T13:14:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/a2806360-7cfb-11ea-9ef5-1ddc5e7e29f2" width="2000" height="1335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/a2806360-7cfb-11ea-9ef5-1ddc5e7e29f2" width="2000" height="1335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazfit's latest earbuds can prod you to fix your posture]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Health-focused brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazfit">Amazfit</a> has revealed its latest earbuds, the PowerBuds Pro. They&#39;re true wireless earbuds with active noise cancellation (ANC) up to 40dB and several health monitoring features, building on the original PowerBuds&#39; heart rate monitoring.</p><p>According to the company, PowerBuds Pro can use an accelerometer to detect the sitting angle of your cervical spine. If your neck has been in the same position for too long, the earbuds can nudge you to make an adjustment and improve your posture. In addition, Amazfit says the buds can detect when you start running and automatically start tracking your run time, speed, distance, calories burned and more. You can sync heart rate data with fitness apps such as RunKeeper and MapMyRun.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few ANC profiles that you can select depending on your surroundings. Indoor mode is centered around eliminating souls like typing, air conditioning and background chatter. In outdoor mode, you&#39;ll still hear announcements, Amazfit claims, but the ANC tech will stamp out trembling engines. There&#39;s also a workout mode, which blocks noises like wind but still lets you hear traffic for safety. The adaptive mode, meanwhile, will adjust the ANC based on your environment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0b4410e0-e0d8-11eb-b177-84b2e184840f" alt="Amazfit PowerBuds Pro" data-uuid="3e139108-c539-3112-b1a6-421ed00e3c9d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazfit</div></figure><p>The earbuds each have three microphones and AI noise-reduction with the aim of helping you have clear phone call quality. PowerBuds Pro will run for up to nine hours on a single charge, according to Amazfit, and the charging case can extend the lifespan to 30 hours.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazfit-bip-s-review-133036996.html">We found</a> the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$70 Bip S" href="https://amzn.to/2VxgJRD">$70 Bip S</a> to be a decent, inexpensive running watch.
