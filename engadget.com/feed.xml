What you won’t find inside the box is a power adapter or USB cable. It’s up to you to supply those, so it’s not quite as affordable as its price would suggest. However, one nifty feature is that the internal batteries are user-replaceable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to IKEA to find out if the company plans to carry the Nordmärke portable Qi charger in the US. In the meantime, if you’re desperate to find a way to charge your devices on the go, your best bet is to buy a portable power bank. You can find ones that cost less than $20. What’s more, they will feature a bigger battery than the Nordmärke and they will charge your devices faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-nordmarke-qi-charger-leak-203043188.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2889294c-c048-4b34-a1b7-62eecb3b928a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 20:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638562275</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T20:11:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8bbd3d50-5473-11ec-89e5-929b28eaefd6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8bbd3d50-5473-11ec-89e5-929b28eaefd6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BananimusPrime]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nordmärke portable Qi charger]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nordmärke portable Qi charger]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Twitter CEO has already begun a 'major reorganization']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html">Jack Dorsey&#39;s recent departure</a>, Twitter&#39;s new CEO Parag Agrawal is wasting no time in shaking up the company.

The company is planning to merge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20plus/">PlayStation Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/playstation%20now/">PlayStation Now</a> into a new offering, which is expected to debut this spring, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/playstation-plans-new-service-to-take-on-xbox-game-pass"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>.</p><p>The service, which is codenamed Spartacus, would likely be available on PS4 and PS5 for a monthly fee. It&#39;s unclear whether players would be able to access it on other devices, though the report notes Sony is putting more resources into cloud gaming. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate allows players to delve into more than 100 Xbox titles via the cloud on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-180329068.html"><ins>consoles</ins></a>, PC, phones and tablets. Microsoft plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html"><ins>make game streaming sticks</ins></a> for TVs too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It seems Sony will kill off PlayStation Now, but keep the PlayStation Plus branding. Sony may not yet have finalized how Spartacus will work, but there could be three tiers to the service. According to documents viewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, the lowest tier would effectively be PlayStation Plus as it is now. The second level would add a &quot;large catalog&quot; of PS4 titles, with PS5 games joining later. The third and highest tier would include cloud gaming, expanded demos and, akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html"><ins>Nintendo Switch Online</ins></a>, a bunch of older PS1, PS2, PS3 and even PSP games. However, those plans may not be set in stone.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear whether Sony plans to bring its first-party exclusives to the service on their release date, as Microsoft does on Game Pass. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-09-17-playstations-jim-ryan-we-want-to-give-gamers-certainty-that-theyre-buying-a-true-next-generation-console"><ins>said last year</ins></a> that the company wouldn&#39;t &quot;go down the road of putting new release titles into a subscription model. These games cost many millions of dollars, well over $100 million, to develop. We just don&#39;t see that as sustainable.&quot;</p><p>But the landscape has shifted since Ryan&#39;s remarks. For one thing, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-microsoft-zenimax-media-deal-completed-151544647.html">Microsoft bought Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media</a> this year. All of Bethesda&#39;s games (save for a couple of timed PS5 console exclusives like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Deathloop/"><em><ins>Deathloop</ins></em></a>) are on Game Pass, and future Bethesda titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/starfield/"><em><ins>Starfield</ins></em></a> might not come to PlayStation at all.</p><p>Although Game Pass would likely be Sony&#39;s biggest competitor in the game subscription market, it&#39;ll be up against several other major companies. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ea%20play/"><ins>EA</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-game-streaming-amazon-luna-google-stadia-160227004.html"><ins>Ubisoft</ins></a> have subscription services, Amazon launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20luna/"><ins>Luna</ins></a> last year and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-iphone-ipad-ios-182421405.html"><ins>Netflix added games</ins></a> to its existing plans. As for cloud gaming (a category Luna also falls into), there&#39;s NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce Now and Google Stadia, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-cloud-gaming-platform-smart-tv-155226529.html"><ins>Samsung has cloud gaming ambitions</ins></a>.</p><p>PlayStation Now was one of the earliest major game subscription services when it debuted in 2015, but it had a fairly tepid response. Players were only able to access PS Now games via the cloud until 2018, when they were able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-20-playstation-now-ps4-ps2-game-downloads.html"><ins>download some PS4 and PS2 titles</ins></a> to their console.</p><p>One of the biggest complaints we had about the service when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-18-playstation-now-re-review.html"><ins>we reviewed it again in 2019</ins></a> was the lack of notable games. Since then, Sony has brought some big games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-playstation-now-fallout-76-final-fantasy-163716243.html"><em><ins>The Last of Us Part II</ins></em><ins> to PS Now</ins></a> for a limited time.</p><p>By the end of Sony&#39;s 2020 financial year, there were <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/irday/pdf/2021/GNS_E.pdf"><ins>only 3.2 million PS Now subscribers</ins></a>. Microsoft <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-game-pass-subscriber-growth-missed-microsofts-annual-target/"><ins>announced</ins></a> in January that it had 18 million Game Pass members. For that reason and many others, it&#39;s a smart idea for Sony to go back to the drawing board and create a more robust subscription service.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like Microsoft, Sony has started looking beyond PlayStation consoles to bring its games to new audiences. Over the last year or so, it released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-000029472.html"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/days-gone-pc-release-date-steam-epic-games-store-trailer-140746800.html"><em>Days Gone</em></a> on PC. A bundle of <em>Uncharted 4 </em>and <em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em> is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-4-and-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-coming-to-ps-5-and-pc-211007741.html">coming to PC in early 2022</a>, as is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-god-of-war-pc-january-14-153911186.html">the 2018 reboot of <em>God of War</em></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-xbox-game-pass-subscription-sparatcus-175650996.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06679f6d-8491-4265-8efe-92f5568e7eaa</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:56:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638556254</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T18:31:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f98906f0-4949-11ec-bc73-6ed9978e7b04" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 and DualSense controller]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle is on sale for $55 with three months of Kindle Unlimited]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed Amazon&#39;s standard e-reader when it was on sale for $50 on Black Friday, you have another shot to grab it for less. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:regular Kindle" href="https://amzn.to/3EgIzmN">regular Kindle</a> is back on sale for $55, and you&#39;ll get three months of Kindle Unlimited along with it. It may be a bit more expensive than it was one week ago, but the added bonus of Kindle Unlimited sweetens the deal a bit — and you&#39;re still getting the device for $35 less than usual.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EgIzmN" id="988fe6a23bd6473baba378be7f54984e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kindle at Amazon - $55</a><p>Amazon updated the Kindle in 2019 and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-amazon-kindle-review-2019.html">score of 91</a> when we reviewed the e-reader. The base model gave the previous-generation Paperwhite a run for its money thanks to its new front-lit display with better contrast and its smaller, sleeker design. It also comes with 8GB of storage, which is plenty of space to hold thousands of titles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The differences between the standard Kindle and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:new Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/31kd8tq">new Kindle Paperwhite</a> will be more apparent, and they should be considering the latter costs $140. The new Paperwhite&#39;s 300ppi screen is slightly larger and 10 percent brighter, and page-turning is said to be about 20 percent faster. The higher-end model also has Audible support, so you can listen to audiobooks when you have a pair of Bluetooth headphones connected, and it&#39;s water-resistant as well.</p><p>If you can live without those extra perks, it&#39;s hard to beat the standard Kindle when it&#39;s on sale like this. It would make a good stocking stuffer for the book-lover in your life, or a convenient gadget if you plan on trying to read more in the new year. And with Kindle Unlimited for a couple of months, you&#39;ll get access to thousands of titles to read at your leisure at no extra cost. Just remember that the subscription will renew at the standard $10-per-month rate after the first three months are up.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-kindle-is-on-sale-for-55-with-three-months-of-kindle-unlimited-173203718.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f83312-ac9a-4863-a494-cffed7db6f17</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 17:32:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638552725</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T17:32:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/9d4f5640-b233-11ea-bfe7-2b4eac12b399" width="1800" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird expands its electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals to San Diego]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bird/">Bird</a> is bringing its electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters to more cities.

Once the auction is complete, the NFT will grant its new owner control of a single webpage. Just like Wikipedia as it exists today, anyone can edit that webpage to change what it says. However, after five minutes, it will revert to its original state, with a single entry stating, “Hello, World!”</p><p>“What you see displayed is what Wikipedia looked like at the moment that I set up the software,” Wales said. “The artistic concept is to take people back to that moment when I set up the website and had to think, ‘Gosh, this is so vulnerable.

The <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/">Irish Council for Civil Liberties</a> (ICCL), says that Europe’s data protection regulators will soon declare the current regime illegal. At the heart of this complaint is both how the industry asks for permission, and then how it serves adverts to users online. Describing the situation as the “world’s biggest data breach,” the consequences of the ruling could have staggering ramifications for everything that we do online.</p><h3>“The world’s biggest data breach”</h3><p>Real-Time Bidding (RTB) is the mechanism by which most online ads are served to you today, and lies at the heart of the issue. Visit a website and, these days, you will notice a split-second delay between the content loading, and the adverts that surround it. You may be reading a line in an article, only for the text to suddenly leap halfway down the page, as a new advert takes its place in front of your eyes. This delay, however small, accommodates a labyrinthine process in which countless companies bid to put their advert in front of your eyes. Omri Kedem, from digital marketing agency <a href="https://croud.com/en-gb/">Croud</a>, explained that the whole process takes less than 100 milliseconds from start to finish.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Advertising is the lifeblood of the internet, providing social media platforms and news organisations with a way to make money. Advertisers feel more confident paying for ads, however, if they can be reasonably certain that the person on the other end is inside the target market. But, in order to make sure that this works, the platform hosting the ad needs to know everything it can about you, the user.</p><p>This is how, say, a sneaker store is able to market its wares to the local sneakerheads or a vegan restaurant looks for vegans and vegetarians in its local area. Companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-removes-sensitive-topic-ad-targeting-222436773.html">Facebook</a> have made huge profits on their ability to laser-focus ad campaigns on behalf of advertisers. But this process has a dark side, and this micro-targeting can, for instance, be used to enable hateful conduct. The most notable example is from 2017, when <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters"><em>ProPublica</em></a> found that you could target a cohort of users deemed anti-semitic with the tag “Jew Hater.”</p><p>Every time you visit a website, a number of facts about you are broadcast to the site’s owner including your IP address. But that data can also include your exact longitude and latitude (if you have built-in GPS), your carrier and device type. Visit a news website every day and it’s likely that both the publisher and ad-tech intermediary will track which sections you spend more time reading.</p><div id="bee70a6895a14c2481680214770623bd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can download Mobilewalla and Ubermedia&#39;s data directories from the evidence we sent the DPC 13+ months ago here <a href="https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC">https://t.co/3ccOMbNyNC</a>. Note: this is clearly the IAB standard. <a href="https://t.co/aSHP3NzQgE">pic.twitter.com/aSHP3NzQgE</a></p>— Johnny Ryan (@johnnyryan) <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnyryan/status/1461342714247598087?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This information can be combined with material you’ve willingly submitted to a publisher when asked. Subscribe to a publication like the <em>Financial Times</em> or <em>Forbes</em>, for instance, and you’ll be asked about your job title and industry. From there, publishers can make clear assumptions about your annual income, social class and political interests. Combine this information — known in the industry as <a href="https://searchdatamanagement.techtarget.com/definition/deterministic-probabilistic-data#:~:text=Deterministic%20data%2C%20also%20referred%20to,one%20user%20to%20one%20dataset.&amp;text=Probabilistic%20data%20is%20information%20that,likelihood%20of%20a%20certain%20outcome.">deterministic data</a> — with the inferences made based on your browsing history — known as probabilistic data — and you can build a fairly extensive profile of a user.</p><p>“The more bidders you have on something you’re trying to sell, in theory, the better,” says Dr. Johnny Ryan. Ryan is a Senior Fellow at the ICCL with a specialism in Information Rights and has been leading the charge against Real-Time Bidding for years. In order to make tracking-based advertising work, the publisher and ad intermediary will compress your life into a series of codes: Bidstream Data. Ryan says that this is a list of “identification codes [which] are highly unique to you,” and is passed on to a number of auction sites.</p><p>“The most obvious identification is the app that you’re using, which can be very compromising indeed, or the specific URL that you’re visiting,” says Ryan. He added that the URL of the site, which can be included in this information, can be “excruciatingly embarrassing” if seen by a third party. If you’re looking up information about a health condition or material related to your sexuality and sexual preferences, this can also be added to the data. And there’s no easy and clean way to edit or redact this data as it is broadcast to countless ad exchanges.</p><p>In order to harmonize this data, the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the online ad industry’s trade body, produces a standard taxonomy. (The IAB, as it is known, has a standalone body operating in Europe, while the taxonomy itself is produced by a New York-based Tech Lab.) The <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/IABTL-Audience-Taxonomy-1.0-5.16.19-Final.xlsx">IAB Audience Taxonomy</a> (subsequently revised to version 1.1) will codify you, for instance, as being into Arts and Crafts (Code 1472) or Birdwatching (435). Alternatively, it can tag you as  having an interest in Islam (602), Substance Abuse (568) or if you have a child with special educational needs (357).&nbsp;</p><p>But not every bidder in those auctions is looking to place an ad, and some are much more interested in the data that is being shared. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ypke/the-nsa-and-cia-use-ad-blockers-because-online-advertising-is-so-dangerous"><em>Motherboard</em></a> story from earlier this year revealed that the United States Intelligence Community mandates the use of ad-blockers to prevent RTB agencies from identifying serving personnel, data which could wind up in the hands of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88aw73/congress-foreign-intelligence-agencies-bidstream-real-time-bidding">rival nations</a>. Earlier versions of <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/standards/content-taxonomy/">IAB&#39;s <em>Content</em> Taxonomy</a> even included tags identifying a user as potentially working for the US military.</p><p>It’s this specificity in the data, coupled with the fact that it can be shared widely and so regularly, that has prompted Ryan to call this the “world’s biggest data breach.” He cited an example of a French firm, Vectuary, which was <a href="https://brave.com/cnil-consent-rtb/">investigated</a> in 2018 by France’s data protection regulator, CNIL. What officials found was data listings for almost 68 million people, much of which had been gathered using captured RTB data. At the time, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/20/how-a-small-french-privacy-ruling-could-remake-adtech-for-good/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported that the Vectaury case could have ramifications for the advertising market and its use of consent banners.</p><h3>The issue of consent</h3><p>In 2002, the European Union produced the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002">ePrivacy Directive</a>, a charter for how companies needed to get consent for the use of cookies for advertising purposes. The rules, and how they are defined, have subsequently evolved, most recently with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">General Data Protection Regulations</a> (GDPR). One of the consequences of this drive is that users within the EU are presented with a pop-up banner asking them to consent to tracking. As most <a href="https://help.ft.com/legal-privacy/cookies/">cookie</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/cookies">policies</a> will explain, this tracking is used for both internal analytics and to enable tracking-based advertising.</p><p>To standardize and harmonize this process, IAB Europe created the<a href="https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/TCFv2/IAB%20Tech%20Lab%20-%20Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v2.md#who-should-create-a-tc-string"> Transparency and Consent Framework</a> (TCF). This, essentially, lets publishers copy the framework laid down by the body on the assumption that they have established a legal basis to process that data. When someone does not give consent to be tracked, a record of that decision is logged in a piece of information known as a TC String. And it’s here that the ICCL has (seemingly) claimed a victory after lodging a complaint with the Belgian Data Protection Authority, the APD, saying that this record constitutes personal data.</p><p>A draft of the ruling was shared with IAB Europe and the ICCL, and reportedly said that the APD found that a TC String did constitute personal data. On November 5th, IAB Europe published a <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/all-news/update-on-the-belgian-data-protection-authoritys-investigation-of-iab-europe/">statement</a> saying that the regulator is likely to “identify infringements of the GDPR by IAB Europe,” but added that those “infringements should be capable of being remedied within six months following the issuing of the final ruling.” Essentially, because IAB Europe was not treating these strings with the same level of care as personal data, it needs to start doing so now and / or face potential penalties.</p><p>At the same time, Dr. Ryan at the ICCL declared that <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/news/online-consent-pop-ups-used-by-google-and-other-tech-firms-declared-illegal/">the campaign had “won” </a>and that IAB Europe’s whole “consent system” will be “found to be illegal.” He added that IAB Europe created a fake consent system that spammed everyone, every day, and served no purpose other than to give a thin legal cover to the massive data breach in at the heart of online advertising.” Ryan ended his statement by saying that he hopes that the final decision, when it is released, “will finally force the online advertising industry to reform.”</p><p>This reform will potentially hinge on the thorny question of if a user can reasonably be relied upon to consent to tracking. Is it enough for a user to click “I Accept” and therefore write the ad-tech intermediary involved a blank check? It’s a question that ad-tech expert and lawyer Sacha Wilson, a partner at <a href="https://www.harbottle.com/">Harbottle and Lewis</a>, is interested in. He explained that, in the law, “consent has to be separate, specific, informed [and] unambiguous,” which “given the complexity of ad tech, is very difficult to achieve in a real-time environment.”</p><p>Wilson also pointed out that something that is often overstated is the quality of the data being collected by these brokers. “Data quality is a massive issue,” he said, “a significant proportion of the profile data that exists is actually inaccurate — and that has compliance issues in and of itself, the inaccuracy of the data.” (This is a reference to Article 5 of the GDPR, where people who process data should ensure that the data is accurate.) In 2018, an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-my-digital-shadow-acxiom-corporation.html">Engadget analysis of data held by prominent data company Acxiom</a> showed that the information held on an individual can be often wildly inaccurate or contradictory.</p><p>One key plank of European privacy law is that it has to be easy enough to withdraw consent if you so choose. But it doesn’t appear as if this is as easy as it could be if you have to approach every vendor individually. Visit<em> ESPN</em>, for instance, and you’ll be presented with a list of vendors (listed by the OneTrust platform) that numbers into the several hundreds. <em>MailOnline’s</em> vendor list, meanwhile, runs to 1,476 entries. (Engadget’s, for what it’s worth, <a href="https://legal.yahoo.com/us/en/yahoo/privacy/topics/thirdparties/index.html#adtech">includes 323</a> “Advertising Technologies” partners.) It is not necessarily the case that all of those vendors will be engaged at all times, but it does suggest that users cannot simply withdraw consent at every individual broker without a lot of time and effort.</p><h3>Transparency and consent</h3><p>Townsend Feehan is the CEO of <a href="https://iabeurope.eu/">IAB Europe</a>, the body currently awaiting a decision from the APD concerning its data protection practices. She says that the thing that the industry’s critics are missing is that “none of this [tracking] happens if the user says no.” She added that “at the point where they open the page, users have control. [They can] either withhold consent, or they can use the right to object, if the asserted legal basis is legitimate interest, then none of the processing can happen.” She added that users do, or do not, consent to the discrete use of their data to a list of “disclosed data controllers,” saying that “those data controllers have no entitlement to share your data with anyone else,” since doing so would be illegal.</p><p>[Legitimate Interest is a framework within the GDPR enabling companies to collect data without consent. This can include where doing so is in the legitimate interests of an organization or third party, the processing does not cause undue harm or detriment to the person involved.]</p><p>While the type of sharing described by the ICCL and Dr. Ryan isn’t impossible, from a technical standpoint, Feehan made it clear that to do so is illegal under European law. “If that happens, it is a breach of the law,” she said, “and that law needs to be enforced.” Feehan added that at the point when data is first collected, all of the data controllers who may have access to that information are named.</p><p>Feehan also said that IAB Europe had practices and procedures put in place to deal with members found to be in breach of its obligations. That can include suspension of up to 14 days if a violation is found, with further suspensions liable if breaches aren’t fixed. IAB Europe can also permanently remove a company that has failed to address its policies, which it signs up to when it joins the TCF. She added that the body is currently working to further automate its audit processes in order to ensure it can proactively monitor for breaches and that users who are concerned about a potential breach can contact the body to share their suspicions.</p><p>It is hard to speculate on what the ruling would mean for IAB Europe and the current ad-tech regime more broadly. Feehan said that only when the final ruling was released would we know what changes the ad industry will have to institute. She asserted that IAB Europe was little more than a standards-setter rather than a data controller in real terms. “We don’t have access to any personal data, we don’t process any data, we’re just a trade association.” However, should the body be found to be in breach of the GDPR, it will need to offer up a clear action plan in order to resolve the issue.</p><h3>It’s not just consent fatigue</h3><p>The issue of Real-Time Bidding data being collected is not simply an issue of companies being greedy or lax with our information. The RTB process means that there is always a risk that data will be passed to companies with less regard for their legal obligations. And if a data broker is able to make some cash from your personal information, it may do so without much care for your individual rights, or privacy.</p><p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mobilewalla-says-data-it-gathered-from-consumers-cellphones-ended-up-with-government-11637242202"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> recently reported that Mobilewalla, an Atlanta-based ad-tech company, had enabled warrantless surveillance through the sale of its RTB data. Mobilewalla’s vast trove of information, some of which was collected from RTB, was sold to a company called Gravy Analytics. Gravy, in turn, passed the information to its wholly-owned subsidiary, Venntel, which then sold the information to a number of federal agencies and related partners.</p><div id="b3eb13b4a7a74e9d80d46ba73b2e085c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In its &#39;data dictionary&#39; doc from Dec 2020, Mobilewalla still states that it harvests and sells precise GPS location data including device IDs on people in GDPR countries like Germany, Spain, Finland, France, UK, Italy, Netherlands, Sweden.<br><br>Online here:<a href="https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm">https://t.co/6fXruZVqGm</a><a href="https://t.co/pD5xPJlUdL">pic.twitter.com/pD5xPJlUdL</a></p>— Wolfie Christl (@WolfieChristl) <a href="https://twitter.com/WolfieChristl/status/1461371902744797195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This trove of information may not have had real names attached, but the <em>Journal </em>says that it’s easy enough to tie an address to where a person’s phone is placed most evenings. And this information was, at the very least, passed on to and used by the Department of Homeland Security, Internal Revenue Service and US Military. All three reportedly tracked individuals both in the US and abroad without a warrant enabling them to do so.</p><p>In July 2020, Mobilewalla came under fire after reportedly revealing that it had tagged and tracked the identity of Black Lives Matter protesters. At the time, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-urge-ftc-probe-of-mobile-ad-industrys-tracking-of-consumers-11596214541?mod=article_inline"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> report added that the company’s CEO, in 2017, boasted that the company could track users while they visit their places of worship to enable advertisers to sell directly to religious groups.</p><p>This sort of snooping and micro-targeting is not, however, limited to the US, with the ICCL finding a report made by data broker OnAudience.com. The study, a <a href="https://www.iccl.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4.-Evidence-of-election-interference-in-Poland-Appendix-A.pdf">copy of which it hosts on its website</a>, discusses the use of databases to create a cohort of around 1.4 million users. These people were targeted based on a belief that they were “interested in LGBTQ+,” identified because they had searched for relevant topics in the prior 14 days. Given both the unpleasant historical precedent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_homosexuals_in_Nazi_Germany">listing people</a> by their sexuality and the ongoing assault on LGBT rights in the country, the ease at which this took place may concern some.</p><h3>Looking to the future</h3><p>On November 25th, the APD <a href="https://www.gegevensbeschermingsautoriteit.be/burger/gba-stuurt-ontwerpbesluit-in-zaak-iab-europe-naar-europese-tegenhangers">announced</a> that it had sent its draft decision to its counterparts in other parts of Europe. If the procedure doesn’t hit any roadblocks, then the ruling will be made public around four weeks later, which means at some point in late December. Given the holidays, we may not see the likely fallout — if any — until January. But it’s possible that either this doesn’t make much of a change in the ad landscape, or it could be dramatic. What’s likely, however, is that the issues around how much a user can consent to having their data used in this manner won’t go away overnight.</p><p><strong>Update, Dec 3rd, 2021 12:30 PM ET:</strong> Corrected a reference to the IAB&#39;s Context Taxonomy which should have referred to its Audience Taxonomy.

A new Insider build now lets you switch from Edge to Chrome, Firefox or other browsers with a single button, rather than laboriously changing the default for each type of link.</p><p>The change only applies to internal links loaded outside a browser. Currently, when you click on such a link, it opens up a dialog box that gives you the option of switching browsers, but your preference isn&#39;t retained unless you tick the &quot;always use this app&quot; box. What&#39;s worse, you have to set the default for multiple types of web files, including HTM, HTML, HTTP and HTTPS. Each time, a confusing nag box pops up asking you to reconfirm your preference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4339b7256dcd4f82875ed30fdcb88adb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Windows build 22509 has a new browser [Set default] button. 👀 <a href="https://t.co/kRDFPKfJMv">pic.twitter.com/kRDFPKfJMv</a></p>— Rafael Rivera (@WithinRafael) <a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>In the latest build, you can set your default browser with a single button, as EarTrumpet app developer <a href="https://twitter.com/WithinRafael/status/1466183359680299009">Rafael Rivera</a> noticed. &quot;In the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22509 released to the Dev Channel on Wednesday, we streamlined the ability for a Windows Insider to set the ‘default browser’ to apps that register for HTTP:, HTTPS:, .HTM, and .HTML,&quot; Microsoft VP Aaron Woodman told <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after Windows 11 came out, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes">said</a> it made the changes to give users more granular control. That prompted complaints from rival browser makers including Brave, Opera, Firefox and Chrome. &quot;We condemn this Windows 11 approach, because the choice of a default browser has many implications for individuals and their privacy. Users should be free to choose,&quot; a Brave spokesperson told <em>The Verge</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft has run into fairly serious antitrust issues with its browsers in the past, having been hit by the EU with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-06-microsoft-european-commission-fine.html">$730 million fine</a> in 2013 for browser choice non-compliance. The EU also fined the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-02-27-microsoft-slammed-by-european-commission-with-1-4b-fine.html">$1.35 billion</a> in 2008 over a similar issue. The new feature is now in testing, but it&#39;s not clear when it will be released widely.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-is-killing-recent-changes-that-made-it-hard-to-switch-browsers-143041174.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b70046d-17bd-40f8-83cf-a8bb1d929a8d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 14:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638541845</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T14:30:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/36806620-543f-11ec-bfa2-95c80810d01c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/36806620-543f-11ec-bfa2-95c80810d01c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing Windows 11 changes that made it hard to switch browsers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing Windows 11 changes that made it hard to switch browsers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's one-day sale knocks up to 30 percent off 2022 Tile trackers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tile Bluetooth trackers were some of the many small gadgets <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-trackers-amazon-good-deal-170005129.html">on sale last week</a> for Black Friday, but you have another chance to grab some of the latest models for less today.

Also, the option is off by default, so you&#39;ll have to find it in settings if you want to take advantage of your phone&#39;s capabilities.</p><p>As the publication notes, <em>Pokémon Go</em> was previously capped at 30fps on iOS — players have had to employ <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/9rdvq0/solution_how_to_run_game_60_fps/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf">workarounds</a> to get their games to run at 60fps — but newer phones are capable of more frames per second than that. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-promotion-display-third-party-apps-225100034.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>, for instance, has a 120fps screen. <em>The Verge</em> says switching the feature on made a huge difference and made the game a lot more responsive. While Niantic may have been trying to cater to owners of the new iPhone, the option can also be accessed on its predecessors. It just may not work as well on hardware powered by older chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can find the the feature in the game&#39;s advanced settings, which will show &quot;native refresh rate unlocked&quot; when it&#39;s switched on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-go-ios-higher-refresh-rates-123636483.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">212989ca-7135-413e-98bc-04a047d3276f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Dec 2021 12:36:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638533783</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T12:16:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4ac778c0-5431-11ec-bb7e-490f398ebaab" width="4018" height="2679" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[adamkaz via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[La Habra, United States - July 12, 2016: Macro closeup image of pokemon go game app icon among other icons on an iphone smartphone device.

That is, however, reportedly no longer the case, but we’re sure Apple will  — as per usual — still report mega profits when it publishes its quarterly reports.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading</ins></strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-suv-teaser-182614489.html"><ins>Polestar offers an early camouflaged glimpse at its electric SUV</ins></a></h2><h3>It’ll be the first model made in the US, too.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-suv-teaser-182614489.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/62acdc40-542d-11ec-bda8-908a71ea3bba" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="Preview image of the Polestar 3 with camo." data-uuid="d16ac213-e0fb-3dbf-952a-37c066f16709"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Polestar</div></figure></a><p>Polestar has offered-up an early look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-3-suv-teaser-182614489.html"><ins>Polestar 3</ins></a>, the company’s first US-made SUV, due to launch at some point in 2022.

According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/google-workers-in-us-wont-return-to-office-as-expected-on-jan-10.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, company security VP Chris Rackow told employees in an email that Google will wait to reassess the situation and figure out when it&#39;s safe to return to an in-office environment until the new year. The tech giant originally planned to implement a hybrid work week starting on October 18th before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-voluntary-return-to-office-plan-204850097.html">pushing it back</a> to January next year. Now, it may all depend on each of its offices.&nbsp;</p><p>Rackow didn&#39;t explain the company&#39;s reasoning in his email, and he didn&#39;t mention the newly discovered Omicron COVID-19 variant, as well. There&#39;s a lot of uncertainty around Omicron, and experts are still looking into whether it&#39;s more transmissible than previous variants and if it&#39;s more resistant to current vaccines. What he reportedly said, however, is that Google will allow specific offices to decide when it&#39;s safe to go back into the office. The company will form Local Incident Response Teams to help them assess risk levels, but bottom line is that Google employees may not be required to adhere to a hybrid workplace schedule all at the same time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite canceling its January 10th target date, Google is still encouraging employees to work in the office &quot;where conditions allow, to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in [one] more regularly.&quot; Google has already reopened 90 percent of its offices in the US, and 40 percent of its employees in the country already came in.

It&#39;s so close to its host red dwarf star that an orbit takes just 7.7 hours, and the radiation is so intense that it could reach up to 2,732 degrees Fahrenheit. That&#39;s enough to melt any metals and rocks, and certainly wouldn&#39;t allow for life as we know it. It&#39;s safe to presume there won&#39;t be any colonization missions as a result.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The assessment by itself is notable, however. GJ 367b is the smallest planet ever characterized to this level of detail, and that could help in the search for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-27-search-habitable-planets-second-earth-exoplanets.html">more habitable exoplanets</a>, understanding planet formation and even gauging the criteria for habitability. Those, in turn, could help astronomers determine whether or not the relatively life-friendly Solar System is as rare as it seems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/small-superhot-exoplanet-gj-367b-234730690.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6649be2c-ee80-4c21-a361-ecaa5a14b1c7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 23:47:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638538838</ingested><modified>2021-12-03T13:40:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d71d2770-53b9-11ec-9bff-ca4571f579a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d71d2770-53b9-11ec-9bff-ca4571f579a8" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SPP 1992 (Patricia Klein)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tiny superhot planet GJ 367b]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tiny superhot planet GJ 367b]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hulu pulls Astroworld news special amid social media backlash]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Thursday, Hulu pulled <em>Astroworld: Concert From Hell</em>, an ABC special many mistook as a documentary on the recent Travis Scott festival that killed 10 people on November 5th, just one day after its debut on the platform.
