For a DC Comics-endorsed restaurant, it’s light on the cringe theme-restaurant tropes.</p><p>But there’s some spectacle — and a lot of love for DC — hidden beneath all the fine trappings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Opening earlier this month in the center of London, Park Row is pitched as a dining experience that takes you to Gotham without the need to wear a costume. In fact, the restaurant’s FAQ <a href="https://parkrowlondon.co.uk/park-row-faq/">notes</a> “Dress more Bruce than Batman,” and there’s actually a ban on people cosplaying inside the venue.</p><p>I’ve visited both tech-laced and themed restaurants for work and pleasure, and Park Row feels a little different, in that it seems entirely made for grown-ups. The idea is simple enough: DC universe meets fine dining, with an immersive high-tech experience inside the Monarch Theater (named after where Batman’s parents were shot) as the showstopper event. Bookable in advance, its £200 ($275) tasting menu is a barrage of 11 themed courses that guide patrons through the heroes and villains of DC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67340d00-0bea-11ec-bffe-93799ad987d6" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London" data-uuid="2e27373d-dbb3-38c2-84f8-59d5e32a89e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Adding some high-tech bells and whistles to restaurants isn’t anything new. There are several restaurants and pop-ups that have played with projection mapping meant to showcase and amplify the food on the plates, dining rooms with carefully set-dressed courses and lurid surroundings.</p><p>The Monarch Theater is all of it put together in a single room. When it’s not showtime, it looks like, well, a conference room. A long, white room with a long, white table in the middle. Aside from the projectors, dotted around the ceiling, it doesn’t look like a room built for immersive superhero dining.</p><section data-eng-breakout="ac53a00b09bb4719aed5b27577cf56ec" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dc5bda30-0beb-11ec-bdbd-2bca9d7584f7" alt="Park Row&#39;s Monarch Theater"></section><p>I can’t tell you every beat of the multi-course experience because I didn’t actually get to test it when I visited. Seating 20 customers, there are two services each day.  Post-launch, the team has since expanded the Monarch Theater part for four sittings per day.</p><p>The team wants to keep some of the courses’ mystique, but I can touch on some of the showpiece parts. The glossy, plain table betrays what’s been packed inside. Park Row doesn’t use projectors for embellishing the dishes or the food. I’m told by a spokesperson that this would distract from the food itself. Instead, the projectors send diners barreling into insane asylum padded cells that vertiginously rotate, making light fittings all pile together in a corner. I’m quickly shown the same room coated in neon graffiti; then wrapped in ivy vines and a final vista high in the clouds.</p><p>Any DC Comics dilettante can assume which characters these projections point to. But it goes on from there. The unassuming conference table (ironically, Cisco was apparently involved with connecting everything together) hides more secrets. Two rails run across the center of the table, making it easier to transform the table when it comes to the Poison Ivy course, which centers around a platter of plants, which seem to be a mix of living and artificial. Within this, serving staff dress the logs and plants with drinks, mysterious edibles and things that I’d call nibbles, but I probably shouldn’t. Some of them are borderline hidden, which seems to be by design.</p><p>Below these rails, a heating element runs the length of the table. Customers are given a playing card during an earlier course, and are told to lay this on the table. As the experience progresses, the card reacts to the heat of the table, revealing a secret message to each diner.</p><p>There are other tricks that aren’t entirely revealed to me, including a floating plate trick that I’ll have to book my own reservation to see.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67340d01-0bea-11ec-bfe8-f2a4f0b6165b" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London" data-uuid="001ed686-c678-330b-9b4d-4124f4856ad6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Outside of the Monarch Theater, Park Row is split up into several different zones, all serving the same food menu — modern European — in a different facet of a fictional Gotham dining scene. From the entrance, modeled after Wayne Manor, you descend a glowing staircase inspired by a Batcave, through a vapor-emitting door frame into Pennyfeathers, a whiskey bar named after Alfred, Bruce Wayne’s long-serving butler. Beyond that, the Iceberg Lounge has a frozen penguin statue towering the bar, while to the left, the Rogue’s Gallery is curated by Catwoman, decorated with reproductions of some of the world’s most famous stolen art pieces, each one marked by a rogue from DC’s back catalog of villains.</p><p>One of these artworks, bizarrely, doubles as a drinks decanter. Now get ready for a deep cut — it’s the same painting used in the 1989 Batman movie. DC fans can probably easily discern which villain has marked each painting, but it’s the nods like this that elevate the whole thing for fans that are able to recall <em>everything</em>.  Ordering the fish and chips will result in a blue-tinged piece of battered fish — hinting at when the Joker poisoned Gotham Harbour. The most egregious nod might be the dessert menu. One dish is called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMD2TwRvuoU">Kiss from A Rose</a>. A little on the nose, but only because everything else is so subtle.</p><p>There are a few molecular gastronomy tricks, too, like edible balloons and freeze-dried popcorn that billow smoke out your mouth as you crunch. It&#39;s these touches that add to the ambiance and fun of the place, and defuses the impression that Park Row may take itself a little <em>too</em> seriously for something based on comic book source material.</p><section data-eng-breakout="f9be461ae84b45c28ba0422c0f97cfbb" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/67018b50-0bea-11ec-befb-8bb646365e6c" alt="Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London"></section><p>Even the restrooms are a playful tribute to the Joker and his minions, all neon signs and bright lights, while paintings around the restaurants give oblique nods to Gotham and its residents. The menus, too, have little symbols that represent DC villains. These touches are there if you look for them, but they’re not obvious — which is good for those of us that don’t want to see anything more superhero-related ever again. I think the point is you could bring a date who has zero interest in the DC universe and capes, and they’d think it’s a glossy, central London restaurant.  Fortunately, the food should be good enough to stand on its own, with an executive chef from a Michelin-starred restaurant. The restaurateur behind it all is known for his work with Heston Blumenthal’s Fat Duck.</p><p>The food has the credentials — and prices — to ensure even if you couldn’t care less about DC, at least you’ll have a good meal and a ridiculous cocktail or two.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dc-comics-park-row-london-gotham-restaurant-review-153100566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df41015f-ada5-46cf-8c28-edf6f234126f</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 15:30:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630595749</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T15:15:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/673bae21-0bea-11ec-abfa-33a016cc66dc" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/673bae21-0bea-11ec-abfa-33a016cc66dc" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith, Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Park Row, the DC-themed restaurant in London]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC bans spyware company SpyFone and its CEO from the surveillance industry]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ftc"><ins>Federal Trade Commission</ins></a> has banned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spyware"><ins>spyware</ins></a> maker SpyFone and its CEO Scott Zuckerman from operating in the surveillance industry.

Some of those who bought the spyware were allegedly able to see live locations of devices and view targets&#39; emails, photos, web browsing history, text messages and video calls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The agency says SpyFone gave its customers instructions on how to install the app secretly and ensure the device user was unaware their activity was being monitored. The spyware had to gain root access to devices for some functions, which the FTC said &quot;could expose the device to security risks.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s more, SpyFone allegedly didn&#39;t secure the data it harvested. The FTC contends that the company didn&#39;t have basic security measures in place. &quot;The stalkerware apps’ security deficiencies include not encrypting personal information it stored, including photos and text messages; failing to ensure that only authorized users could access personal information; and transmitting purchasers’ passwords in plain text,&quot; the agency said. That enabled a hacked to obtain personal data of around 2,200 people in 2018, according to the FTC.</p><p>Commissioners voted unanimously to ban SpyFone and Zuckerman from the surveillance industry. Specifically, the company and its CEO are prohibited from &quot;offering, promoting, selling or advertising any surveillance app, service or business.&quot;</p><p>In 2019, the FTC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-ftc-ban-stalking-apps.html"><ins>banned Retina-X Studios</ins></a> from promoting and selling spyware apps unless it was able to prove the services were only being used for legitimate purchases. This time around, the agency is letting the public comment on the SpyFone and Zuckerman decision.</p><p>Commissioner Rohit Chopra said in a statement that the FTC action doesn&#39;t absolve SpyFone and Zuckerman from any criminal liability. &quot;While this action was worthwhile, I am concerned that the FTC will be unable to meaningfully crack down on the underworld of stalking apps using our civil enforcement authorities,&quot; Chopra <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1595161/updated_date_final_chopra_statement_on_spyfone_.pdf">wrote</a>. &quot;I hope that federal and state enforcers examine the applicability of criminal laws, including the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the Wiretap Act and other criminal laws, to combat illegal surveillance, including the use of stalkerware.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-spyware-company-spyfone-surveillance-industry-151300900.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa348fcf-1f2d-440d-865e-edafc9906b15</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 15:13:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630595583</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T15:13:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3d2c9260-0bff-11ec-adfd-d20e0d2abbc7" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3d2c9260-0bff-11ec-adfd-d20e0d2abbc7" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ali Kerem Yücel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skull of death symbol on the screen of smartphone on laptop computer.

The messaging service allegedly failed to live up to its General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) transparency obligations.</p><p>The Commission also said the data sharing itself violated GDPR. WhatsApp was merely storing &quot;pseudonymous&quot; phone number data, for instance, rather than truly anonymizing it. While the numbers were stored using lossy hashes, WhatsApp had the hash key needed to decrypt that info — it could tie that number to a specific person if it wanted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ruling asked WhatsApp to both improve its transparency and bring the data sharing in line with the GDPR. The Irish agency initially planned to fine WhatsApp €50 million ($59.3 million) for breaking GDPR, but hiked the punishment after Germany and other countries accused the Commission of being lenient on privacy violations.</p><p>WhatsApp unsurprisingly planned to appeal the decision. It claimed that it met transparency requirements in 2018 (around when the investigation began) and that the fines were &quot;entirely disproportionate.&quot; It maintained that it strived to offer &quot;transparent and comprehensive&quot; information to users.</p><p>The fine is the latest in a string of penalties for tech giants over violations. Amazon faced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fine-eu-data-privacy-130443268.html">record $888 million fine</a> in July over GDPR issues, and Twitter was asked to pay €450 million ($533.6 million) when it failed to report a data leak within 72 hours. WhatsApp&#39;s fine is light by comparison, then, although it&#39;s arguably <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-wont-limit-accounts-dont-accept-privacy-policy-160132557.html">grappling with a larger blowback</a> over its data policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-eu-fine-facebook-data-sharing-144749929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee556b9a-083d-4dd4-be7b-361ea4ad84a5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:47:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630594071</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T14:47:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/07c13190-6f5f-11eb-b217-91175144ecf8" width="3334" height="2324" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/07c13190-6f5f-11eb-b217-91175144ecf8" width="3334" height="2324" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D printed Whatsapp and Facebook logos are placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken January 21, 2021.

Now every manufacturer has at least one, making even some of the most jaded tech reviewers exclaim “how did they do this?”</p><p>But, even with the ubiquity of ultraportable laptops, some continue to stand out for their ability to balance sleek designs with powerful performance. As with any else, though, the best ultraportable laptops still demand some sacrifices. We’re here to help you decide which ones are worth making.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What to expect</h2><p>The first thing to remember is that the term “ultraportable” is subjective. There aren’t any hard-and-fast rules governing the weight and thickness. We at Engadget define an ultraportable laptop as one that weighs less than three pounds and measures less than 0.75 inch thick at its widest point. Usually that means you’re talking about 13-inch and 14-inch laptops, though occasionally a 15-inch device hits the mark too.</p><p>Most ultraportables have high-end design touches like ultra-slim bezels, gem-cut edges, and premium materials because they tend to sit at the top of the line. Companies spend a lot of time and money engineering them to be as thin and light as possible without sacrificing too much on power and battery life. They tend to be made from metal, carbon fiber or a mix of the two, and their enclosures are usually just thick enough to include the latest Intel or Ryzen processors, large batteries and enough RAM and storage for most people’s needs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/98e7c4a0-eb92-11ea-b3fb-e2e6726b0a03" alt="Dell XPS 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>What you won’t find in most ultraportables are high-powered GPUs or loads of ports. Most have integrated graphics chips (think: Intel UHD) because anything more powerful would take up space and pose heat-management problems. When it comes to ports, the edges of these laptops simply don’t have a lot of free space. You’re almost guaranteed to get a couple Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C ports on the newest notebooks, but some have already abandoned the USB-A standard, which is a shame.</p><p>Also, due to the flagship caliber of most ultraportables, you can expect to pay top dollar for these. Most start at $1,000, gradually increasing in price as you bump up the specs. However, there are a few we’d recommend that often come in below the $1,000 mark, either thanks to slightly lower starting prices or frequent sales. We’ve included a “budget” pick in this guide, but just know that “budget” in this case doesn’t mean cheap; it means relatively affordable.</p><p>One other thing that’s important to consider is battery life. Manufacturers have gotten better at eking out more juice from their devices. We recommend buying one rated for at least eight to 10 hours.</p><p>You can take all of that advice and wade through the plethora of product pages on the Internet to find the best ultraportable laptop for you. But if you don’t have that kind of time or patience, we’ve compiled a list of the devices that we consider to be the best options available right now.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best overall: Dell XPS 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/de59cfe0-eb8f-11ea-87ff-661ce183e954" alt="Dell XPS 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Dell didn’t overhaul the XPS 13 for 2021, because why fix what isn’t broken? Instead, the company brought in more optional add-ons so customers could make its flagship laptop as personalized as possible — as long as they have the cash to do so.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ">XPS 13</a> has been one of our favorite laptops for years thanks to its slim, attractive design, powerful performance and solid battery life. In 2020, we saw Dell remove the excessive chin bezel below the screen, letting the 13.4-inch display extend from corner to corner. It now has a 16:10 aspect ratio, which is better than before but not quite as good as a 3:2 ratio. We prefer taller screens because they reduce the amount of scrolling necessary to browse web pages and review documents comfortably. The XPS 13’s display continues to support HDR and Dolby Vision, so you’ll get top-notch video quality whenever you stream. New for 2021 is the optional 3,456 x 2,160 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">OLED display</a>, which you can add to the XPS 13 for about $300 extra.</p><p>The XPS 13 remains just as thin and light as it has been for the past couple of years. It weighs only 2.64 pounds and measures just over a half-inch thick at its widest point. We also like its spacious trackpad and comfortable, scissor-switch keyboard. It may not be the flashiest ultraportable on our list, but honestly we kinda dig the XPS’ subtle design. It looks and feels like a flagship device, but it never feels ostentatious.</p><p>Those set on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ">XPS 13</a> in 2021 will find Tiger Lake processors powering the laptop, and the option to trick it out with up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage. Notably, the base model includes 8GB of RAM much better than the 4GB minimum on past models. Four gigs is rarely enough for a daily driver (unless you’re looking at a Chromebook), and it’s reassuring to see Dell finally came around on that. If you’re going to upgrade anything when ordering directly from Dell, we recommend springing for the Core i5 processor instead of sticking with the base Core i3.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bit.ly/2Y3TakZ" id="6c050c723c0643e3a7ab389006e1df0f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Dell;elmt:viglink;pdid:">Buy Dell XPS 13 starting at $999</a><h3>Best for Apple fans: MacBook Air M1</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="Apple MacBook Air M1" data-uuid="720a9600-0957-3d5e-9036-031264cc2d04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple continues to make the  MacBook Air a compelling option for most people thanks to the M1 chipset in the latest model. And that’s really the star of the show here — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3mACQCj">MacBook Air M1</a> is blazing fast, running native apps like Safari and GarageBand without breaking a sweat. The laptop wakes almost instantly when you open its lid, sites load swiftly and scrolling is seamless. And because M1 is ARM-based, you’ll be able to run iOS apps on the Air, too.</p><p>While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> looks familiar on the outside, a big  difference under the hood is that there’s no fan. Although you sacrifice a bit in the way of heat management, it means the laptop runs more quietly than before. And just because its appearance hasn’t changed, doesn’t mean it looks dated. It still has an attractive 2.8-pound unibody enclosure, a gorgeous 13.3-inch Retina Display, a TouchID fingerprint sensor and a comfortable keyboard with springy buttons (no problematic butterfly keys to be found here).</p><p>Along with the M1 processor, the latest MacBook Air comes most readily with 8GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. If you order directly from Apple, you can increase the RAM to 16GB and get as much as 2TB of internal storage. A fully specced-out model will set you back $1,800, but most people will find that their needs are met by the 256GB base model.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mACQCj" id="c3a0b1c1c7334ed3b86bd9a9a6baedc2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon starting at $999</a><h3>Best convertible: HP Spectre x360 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/3f00be20-eb91-11ea-97fe-6ce20995fd32" alt="HP Spectre x360 13"><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Spectre x360 13" href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm">Spectre x360 13</a> is the culmination of years of improvements on HP’s part. It combines most of the things we’d want in a laptop, including a versatile convertible design. Old-school 2-in-1s had a tendency to be wobbly and unstable, but this is anything but. Its metallic hinges provide a sturdy structure for the machine when in laptop mode and spin smoothly whenever you need to work in tent or tablet mode.</p><p>The model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-27-hp-spectre-x360-13-inch-review.html">we reviewed</a> in 2019 had a 1080p touchscreen, but HP gives you the option to outfit the Spectre x360 13 with a 4K AMOLED panel — a good choice for creatives and streaming aficionados (just be prepared for shorter battery life). By no means is a 4K display necessary on a 13-inch machine, but companies have been adding them as options on flagships to satisfy all the display nerds out there. Regardless of the screen you choose, the laptop’s 90-percent screen-to-body ratio will provide an immersive experience when you’re watching movies on Netflix. The keyboard is also quite comfortable and we particularly like that HP made the buttons as large as possible, stretching them all the way to the edges of the chassis.</p><p>In addition, HP included an IR camera for Windows Hello, a Precision touchpad and a few more ports than you’d expect to see on an ultraportable of this size. Its edges hold two USB-C ports for charging and data, a USB-A port and a microSD slot. The machine’s 14.5-hour battery life makes it even more versatile, as it lasts an entire work or school day with juice left to spare.</p><p>The worst thing we can say about the Spectre x360 13 is that its webcam produces grainy video and HP includes a bit more bloatware than other OEMs. Also, the machine&#39;s jewelry-like design may not be to some shoppers’ tastes, but it’s not garish enough for us to knock it either. It also helps that the <a href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm">base model</a> now includes an 11th-gen Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and an FHD touchscreen for just over $1,000. What’s more, HP is one of the few companies to include a stylus with its flagship convertible at no extra cost, meaning you can use it as a digital notebook straight out of the box.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jgdNCm" id="d0d44523f8634371804279e44ad6afa0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Spectre x360 13 at HP starting at $1,109</a><h3>Best budget option: HP Pavilion Aero 13</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" style="height:1191;width:1852;" alt="HP Pavilion Aero" data-uuid="c1611205-6a79-39ad-9a0d-3582355eff83"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>In order to appeal to Gen-Z users, HP made its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pavilion Aero 13" href="https://fave.co/3yjQsnQ">Pavilion Aero 13</a> laptop as thin and light as possible while keeping it at a relatively affordable price. Starting at $749, the laptop weighs only 2.2 pounds and takes some design notes from the company&#39;s Spectre and Elitebook lines. That makes it a pretty attractive machine, and that&#39;s not something we take for granted at this price range.</p><p>While its keyboard is not backlit by default, it is comfortable to type on even if the layout is slightly more cramped than usual thanks to the page up/down key column on the right side. You also get a big trackpad and a 13.3-inch 1,920 x 1,200 display on the base model, plus the option to upgrade to a 2,560 x 1,600 display if you like. We also appreciate the port variety on this machine: two USB-A ports, one HDMI connector, one USB-C port and a 3.5mm audio jack. HP has generally done a good job keeping as many connectors as possible on even its flagship laptops, and it&#39;s nice to see that its budget notebooks received the same treatment.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html">reviewed</a> the top-tier model that costs $999, but the base model isn&#39;t anything to scoff at. It includes a Ryzen 5 5600U processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is impressive when you consider other flagship laptops with similar RAM and storage amounts cost $250 more to start. While it does force some sacrifices, the Pavilion Aero 13 is not one to overlook if you want a good value laptop.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3yjQsnQ" id="d5b890711e104fab824bddde6c48ace8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HP;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Pavilion Aero 13 at HP starting at $749</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-120008636.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99a7fb08-b4cb-3598-890c-6f6d878339b1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 14:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630591824</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T14:10:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Dell]]></category><category><![CDATA[MacBookAir]]></category><category><![CDATA[ultraportables]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[xps13]]></category><category><![CDATA[spectrex36013]]></category><category><![CDATA[HP]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[zenbook13]]></category><category><![CDATA[laptops]]></category><category><![CDATA[Asus]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/60f2f830-eb92-11ea-8f37-98e1e97338a8" width="1600" height="1038" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/60f2f830-eb92-11ea-8f37-98e1e97338a8" width="1600" height="1038" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP Spectre x360 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Spectre x360 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony will hold a PlayStation showcase on September 9th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s finally ready to <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"><ins>show off</ins></a> more of what it&#39;s working on for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ps5"><ins>PS5</ins></a> for this holiday season and beyond.

As <em>Fortune</em><a href="https://fortune.com/2021/09/02/in-boost-for-net-neutrality-top-eu-court-plunges-dagger-into-controversial-zero-rating-practice/">reports</a>, the EU&#39;s Court of Justice <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-09/cp210145en.pdf">has ruled</a> that zero-rating (aka &quot;zero tariff&quot;) options violate net neutrality and are &quot;incompatible with EU law.&quot; These perks don&#39;t honor EU regulations demanding that providers treat traffic equally, the court said.</p><p>The decision came after two German courts asked the Court of Justice about the legality of zero-rated options from carriers Telekom Deutschland (with a large stake in T-Mobile in the US) and Vodafone. The former offers a &quot;Stream On&quot; option that doesn&#39;t count music or video streaming from partner services toward your cap. Vodafone, meanwhile, offers passes (such as &quot;Video Pass&quot; and &quot;Music Pass&quot;) that waives data use for partners in different app categories, but only in Germany on your phone — travel or use hotspot tethering and that benefit disappears.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Critics have attacked zero-rating as an attempt to stifle competition or arbitrarily boost revenue through partner deals and pricier service bundles. Providers can use these exclusions to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-blames-net-neutrality-for-hbo-max-hit-on-its-data-caps-095555622.html">promote their own media services</a> at the expense of rivals, for example, or force competing services to sign special agreements to avoid being hobbled. You might also be asked to pay more — a carrier could ask you to subscribe to a pass just so you can watch TV shows without worrying about overage fees or throttling.</p><p>While the ruling touches on German ISPs, it sets a precedent that effectively bars zero-rating services across the EU. Local courts would only have to refer to the EU case. The question, of course, is whether non-EU countries will look to this as an example. The US has a pseudo-ban on zero-rating thanks to a California law, but the federal government hasn&#39;t yet followed suit after the Pai-era FCC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-03-the-fcc-stops-investigating-carriers-zero-rating-plans.html">shut down investigations</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eu-zero-rating-net-neutrality-ruling-132559309.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">71a5aa23-9730-461e-bd1d-61e8f6725887</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 13:25:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630589161</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T13:26:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fe3bd6b0-0bea-11ec-a47f-45de78b480e9" width="4724" height="3059" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fe3bd6b0-0bea-11ec-a47f-45de78b480e9" width="4724" height="3059" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thilo Schmuelgen / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logos of 5G technology and telecommunications company Vodafone are pictured at the 5G Mobility Lab of Vodafone in Aldenhoven, Germany, November 27, 2018.

The chipmaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-app-streamers-165218841.html">launched</a> the application for PCs equipped with RTX GPUs in 2020 to give people a way to make their livestreams look and feel more professional even if they&#39;re streaming from home. Up until now, though, it&#39;s only been focused on webcams. Now even streamers who use more specialized or expensive equipment will be able to take advantage of its AI-driven features.&nbsp;</p><p>Version 1.3 of the Broadcast app supports Canon&#39;s EOS Webcam Utility, Nikon&#39;s Webcam Utility and Sony&#39;s Webcam Utility, all of which are software tools that bring webcam-like function to the brands&#39; cameras. Perhaps more importantly, the update also gives the app support for OBS Virtual Camera, making it possible to use Broadcast with any video device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to expanding the app&#39;s hardware compatibility, version 1.3 also comes with an upgraded noise removal AI. The feature sometimes removes the host&#39;s voice when they&#39;re speaking loudly or at a higher pitch than usual, which isn&#39;t strange for streams where emotions can run high, such as in gaming streams. To address that, NVIDIA developed dedicated training sound profiles allowing the app to remove background noise without inadvertently muting the streamer.&nbsp;</p><p>The new app reduces VRAM usage by over 40 percent compared to its predecessor, as well, which could translate to an increase in FPS while gaming. NVIDIA added the ability to stack effects in version 1.2, but running several AI features for the mic, speakers and camera can eat up a lot of memory. This solves any issue streamers may have with their computers slowing down. To access Broadcast&#39;s new features and UI upgrades and to use it with professional cameras, users will have to download and install version 1.3 from the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/broadcasting/broadcast-app/">company&#39;s website</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f2fc630-0be2-11ec-bdcf-ddffd13c6b44" style="height:529;width:1000;" alt="NVIDIA" data-uuid="dffcc634-2818-35d0-9af0-6d7dbafd420a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-app-supports-professional-cameras-130029164.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">283e0468-4b84-4eda-9217-848fee7b7e28</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 13:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630583107</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T11:45:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d81a96c0-0bda-11ec-b7ef-c512699f1fe5" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d81a96c0-0bda-11ec-b7ef-c512699f1fe5" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 drops down to $600 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s Mac Mini M1 is a good option for those eager to replace an aging desktop but also want to conserve space.

Designs haven&#39;t changed much across the board with Apple&#39;s latest computers, so the M1 chipset really is the star of the show. Using an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, it makes everything run more smoothly and quickly, and there&#39;s an additional 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks.

Although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ifa-has-been-cancelled-after-all-114810492.html">IFA isn&#39;t happening</a> in Berlin this year due to COVID-19, the company is still ready to show off all of the new audio gear that will arrive this fall. That list includes four new models of true wireless earbuds, two new portable speakers, a set of noise-cancelling headphones for kids and a wireless gaming headset.</p><h2>All of the true wireless earbuds</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a65b8730-0b9d-11ec-bdcb-559fd3a23f99" alt="JBL Endurance Race" data-uuid="63efa9af-c1e3-33fc-a748-473942b5a3f6"><figcaption>JBL Endurance Race</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Sitting atop <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBL&#39;s latest true wireless earbuds" href="https://fave.co/3mU2h1V">JBL&#39;s latest true wireless earbuds</a> list is the Reflect Flow Pro. This sporty model is rated IP68 waterproof with the company&#39;s Powerfin fit wings to help keep them in place during a run or workout. Active noise cancellation (ANC) can help you block out unwanted distractions while a Smart Ambient feature allows you to be aware of your surroundings with audio transparency.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>JBL promises &quot;perfect voice clarity&quot; on calls with the Reflect Flow Pro thanks to six microphones: two beamforming with a third for wind suppression on each side. Companies make lofty claims about voice performance all the time, so it will be interesting to see how close JBL actually gets to perfection. The Reflect Flow Pro will last up to eight hours on a charge with ANC on, with an additional two charges in the wireless charging case. You can also expect hands-free access to Google Assistant, customizable touch controls and compatibility with JBL&#39;s Headphones app. The Reflect Flow Pro will go on sale November 14th for $179.95 (€179).</p><p>For more affordable options, JBL is debuting follow-ups to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-headphones-ces-2021-151556238.html">Tune 125 TWS and Tune 225 TWS</a> earbuds. The new Tune 130NC and Tune 230NC have nearly identical spec sheets that include features like Pure Bass Sound, ANC, eight-hour battery life (ANC on), IPX4 water resistance, touch controls and a four-microphone array for calls. The differences are mostly in the designs: the Tune 230NC has an AirPods like stickbud look while the Tune 130NC is a more compact round shape. The latter also has larger 10mm drivers compared to the former&#39;s 5.8mm components. Both versions will arrive on October 17th and they&#39;re both $99.95 (€99).&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, JBL&#39;s fourth new true wireless model will only be available in the US. The Endurance Race joins the company&#39;s lineup of sport-themed Endurance products that include the Run, Sprint, Jump, Dive and Peak audio options. Like previous installments, the Endurance Race is IP67 waterproof, designed to mix durability with comfort to withstand workouts and weather. JBL&#39;s Pure Bass Sound is here as well, on top of 10-hour battery life, touch controls and ambient sound. There&#39;s no active noise cancellation or wireless charging here, but the price is affordable at $79.95. The Endurance Race is set to go on sale October 17th.</p><h2>JBL JR 460NC headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e02847f0-0b9d-11ec-bedf-e79c7b4a3514" alt="JBL JR 460NC" data-uuid="487cb77b-4f5c-3832-8592-c48275427cd8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>Let&#39;s face it: most wireless headphones aren&#39;t designed to be used by kids. They&#39;re not nearly durable enough to withstand the constant drops and tosses into backpacks, plus you have to worry if your little ones are listening too loud. JBL says its new JR 460NC should address both of those concerns. The company&#39;s Safe Sound feature keeps volume under 85dB and the headphones are made with &quot;child-friendly, safe materials.&quot; ANC will help block out distractions for homework or travel, controls should be easy for kids to master and 20 hours of battery life ensures lots of use between charges. The JR 460NC is scheduled to arrive in the US this month for $79.95.</p><h2>JBL Flip 6 and Partybox 710 portable speakers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1de814d0-0b9e-11ec-bbbf-8096929c0b68" alt="JBL Flip 6" data-uuid="d609b72f-bfcd-33b1-aa92-3b6e30ec7be8"><figcaption>JBL Flip 6</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>For your portable speaker needs, JBL has two very different new options. First, the Flip 6 is a compact Bluetooth model designed for the outdoors with an IP67 dust and waterproof rating and 12 hours of battery life. The company says its dual passive radiator speaker configuration offers &quot;deep bass&quot; and &quot;stunning detail,&quot; thanks in part to a &quot;racetrack-shaped&quot; woofer and separate tweeter. The Flip 6 can also be used in PartyBoost mode where you can connect it to other compatible JBL speakers for more volume. This model will arrive in the US in December for $129.95 after debuting in Europe in November for €139. Grey, teal, blue, black and &quot;squad&quot; color options will be available at launch.&nbsp;</p><p>The JBL PartyBox 710 is, as the name suggests, a single speaker large enough to power a whole dang party. This model joins the company&#39;s other options that are built for more than just casual listening. With 800 watts of power and an on-board light show, this quickly becomes an all-in-one entertainment machine. That&#39;s especially true when you factor in the guitar and microphone inputs. There&#39;s also Bluetooth and USB connectivity for music and one-touch stereo pairing with another PartyBox 710. The JBL PartyBox app allows you to control everything from tunes to the light show and more. Lastly, the massive speaker is IPX4 splashproof to evade accidental spill damage and its built-in handle and wheels help with transport. The 710 will debut in Europe in October for €749 before arriving in the US in November for $799.95.&nbsp;</p><h2>JBL Quantum 350 wireless gaming headset</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59f66120-0b9e-11ec-b05d-7192b7dcecf0" alt="JBL Quantum 350" data-uuid="47c9d6d3-1f39-373e-816b-52fca94254a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JBL</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re looking for a new wireless gaming headset, the JBL Quantum 350 checks a number of boxes. The headphones support &quot;gaming-grade&quot; lossless 2.4G wireless connectivity with a USB dongle, according to the company. JBL says 40mm drivers inside are powered by its QuantumSound Signature and QuantumSurround handles the immersive audio. The company&#39;s QuantumEngine PC software will enable you to customize the EQ, sidetone, mic settings and more. JBL promises comfort with a lightweight design and memory foam ear pads with up to 22 hours of battery life to keep you going well into the night. The company says the Quantum 350 is Discord certified and also compatible with both Skype and TeamSpeak. Most importantly, the headset goes on sale later this month for $99.95 (€119).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-true-wireless-earbuds-fall-2021-123016677.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb1e9b2b-3de0-4fba-9402-bd7543826255</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 12:30:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630590948</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T13:56:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/71d16ef0-0b9b-11ec-bece-963b7d97e1be" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/71d16ef0-0b9b-11ec-bece-963b7d97e1be" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL Reflect Flow Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Reflect Flow Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Locast's local TV streaming service loses legal protections]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Locast, a company that claimed to improve access to local TV stations for people who can’t get the signal via traditional means, has been dealt a blow by a New York Court.

The Korean giant has today <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-advanced-ultra-fine-pixel-technologies-to-new-mobile-image-sensors">announced</a> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-2-phone-camera-sensor-162055301.html">ISOCELL</a> HP1, which it says is the first 200-megapixel image sensor (with 0.64μm pixels) for mobile devices. It added that the silicon is already small enough to fit in mobile hardware and that the promise of all of those extra pixels is to retain fidelity when pictures are cropped or resized.</p><p>Of course, these eye-catching figures don’t really mean a huge amount given that the HP1 will use pixel-binning just like every other overpowered image sensor. But arguably, the biggest innovation here is ChameleonCell, which can adjust the extent of the binning depending on the environment.

In a piece discussing not just that particular flight but the company&#39;s various <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-31-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo.html">safety</a> issues throughout the years, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> explained that Virgin&#39;s spacecraft went off-course during descent, triggering an &quot;entry glide-cone warning.&quot; The spacecraft uses the glide cone method, which mimics water circling down the drain, for landing. Apparently, the pilots for the mission didn&#39;t fly as steeply as they should have, causing the system to raise the alarm.&nbsp;</p><p>An FAA spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-faa-probing-virgin-galactic-july-11-flight-deviation-2021-09-01/"><em>Reuters</em></a> that the vehicle &quot;deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America&quot; and it&#39;s investigating the incident. The agency gives missions to space a designated airspace they can fly in to prevent collisions with commercial planes and to minimize civilian casualties in the event of an accident. Virgin&#39;s Unity 22 mission flew out of that designated airspace for a minute and forty-one seconds before the pilots were able to correct course.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nicholas Schmidle, author of <em>The New Yorker</em> piece, said he attended a meeting a few years ago, wherein the same pilots on the Unity 22 flight said a red light entry glide-cone warning should &quot;scare the shit out of you.&quot; Apparently, that means it&#39;s too late, and that the safest course of action is to abort. In a statement it <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/09/01/virgin-galactic-statement-about-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-suborbital-space-flight/">published</a> after the article went out, though, Virgin Galactic said it &quot;disputes the misleading characterizations and conclusions&quot; in the piece and that the people on the flight weren&#39;t in any danger as a result of the flight deviation. The company said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters. Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>It also said that the spacecraft did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the mission&#39;s protected airspace,  though it did drop below the altitude of the airspace it was provided. The company added that it&#39;s &quot;working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/faa-probe-anomaly-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-092123771.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ac480b9-2033-4efa-9d98-7775653d1f9b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630574512</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T09:22:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/152be540-e288-11eb-bff3-9365edfa02ac" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/152be540-e288-11eb-bff3-9365edfa02ac" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW MEXICO, USA - JULY 11: Sir Richard Branson flew into space aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel, a voyage he described as the "experience of a lifetime" at the Spaceport America in New Mexico, United States on July 11, 2021.

It’s packed full of references across the franchise, including Beckett Mariner, Sam Rutherford and Brad Boimler engaging in a not-so-friendly match of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Anbo-jyutsu"><ins>anbo-jyutsu</ins></a>, the appearance of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Outpost_(episode)"><ins>not-so-enlightened Ferengi</ins></a> and even the episode name, which references how no one can seem to agree on how to pronounce the creature whose name is spelled “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Mugato"><ins>mugato</ins></a>.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/45966bc0-0b5e-11ec-af9f-1cf89e0334ec" style="height:1079;width:1917;" alt="LCARS graphics" data-uuid="b5e9185b-5504-3351-b891-f9b8ede8d43a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, after a season and a half, the show has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html"><ins>settled into a groove</ins></a>, and as a streaming program there’s no reason why “Mugato, Gumato” would be anyone’s first episode. Paramount+ would only pull up this one if last week’s “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-tom-paris-voyager-070055176.html"><ins>We’ll Always Have Tom Paris</ins></a>” had recently been watched. With less need to be accessible, that leaves a show like <em>Lower Decks</em> free to dabble in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html"><ins>continuity and in-jokes for the long-time fans</ins></a>.</p><p>Fan service is often derided for being gratuitous at best, and an act of gatekeeping at worst. After nearly 55 years and over 800 episodes aired, Star Trek has a lot of baggage that can be intimidating to a newcomer. The Abrams reboot in 2009 tried to wipe the slate clean but was still bogged down by decades of cultural knowledge, with even Trek casuals expecting to hear phrases like “beam me up” and “I’m a doctor!” It found itself trying to appease multiple groups of fans and ultimately thrilling few.</p><div id="cbb36f94c766455fafd9e595f692f8fe"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vlWcGOQXspY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>And yet, despite its deep dives into Star Trek lore, <em>Lower Decks</em> can still be a great entryway for new fans in how it chooses to subvert so many long-time franchise tropes. Both newcomers and hardcore Trekkies get to be on the same page when it comes to the all-important question: What comes next?</p><p>In that vein, “Mugato, Gumato” is a fun ride. The main plot revolves around the re-discovery of a rare species only previously seen in a rather forgettable <em>TOS</em> episode, with the <em>USS Cerritos</em> charged with finding out how the animals got so far from their home planet. It’s not the most thrilling adventure on the surface, which makes it a perfect assignment for the crew of the lower-tier ship. Boimler and Rutherford are assigned to the away team, which would normally <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Redshirt"><ins>spell doom</ins></a> for a pair of chronically unlucky ensigns.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/412834d0-0b61-11ec-b73e-8a18c28b677e" style="height:1068;width:1914;" alt="Bradward Boimler" data-uuid="50eb7613-5c7d-3f3c-a39e-b618107c2119"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Instead, the rest of the group is captured by a group of Ferengi poachers, leaving Brad and Sam in the unlikely and awkward position of saviors. But rather than have them step into the role of “action-oriented leading men,” they instead embrace their unique skills as “nerdy supporting characters.” Meanwhile, it’s the captain and bridge crew who get stuck with the b-plot of helping out a stranded trader whose ship they accidentally destroyed.</p><p>After Boimler and Rutherford save the day with a well-thought-out PowerPoint (yes, really) it ends up being the senior staff who isn’t fully informed of what happened on the planet. This is in direct contrast to a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Veritas_(episode)"><ins>previous episode</ins></a> where Boimler has pointed out that it’s not their place to know what’s going on. Captain Freeman just shrugs the whole incident off as some “environmentally conscious Ferengi,” apparently unaware of the two ensigns’ key role in getting the ultra-capitalist Ferengi to change their ways in favor of a more profitable path without resorting to violence.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f1dbee0-0b60-11ec-af9e-cc5caa37cd22" style="height:1061;width:1910;" alt="Rutherford and Boimler pointing a... thing" data-uuid="a73ab703-21ad-3b2d-b2e6-57d34df160b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>It also ends up being good for continuity, in how it reconciles the two versions of Ferengi we’ve seen throughout the franchise. Here, it argues, they really are the same species in the end, just that the offensive, retrograde Ferengi from “The Last Outpost” hadn’t found a less overtly evil way to make money.</p><p>“Mugato, Gumato” may have trafficked in old tropes, but it also twisted them in a way to teach the characters and audience something new about themselves and the franchise. Or, as Boimler and Rutherford would say, “If we’re both unhappy, it means we’ve reached… a compromise!”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3da716f5-d782-46ea-ba1a-4d86ca572760</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 07:01:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630528436</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T20:34:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6c399a0-0b62-11ec-afff-b8ed7e036156" width="1920" height="1079" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6c399a0-0b62-11ec-afff-b8ed7e036156" width="1920" height="1079" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rutherford and Boimler playing "Diplomath"]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will allow some media apps to link outside the App Store for payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has been taking a lot of flak lately over the 30 percent cut it takes from app developers.

The gaming developer has been leading the charge against the tech giant over the past year ever since it decided to offer discounts on <em>Fortnite&#39;</em>s V-bucks currency and other cash purchases outside the App Store. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">removed</a><em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store in response, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sues-apple-195415590.html">lawsuit</a> that resulted from that brought to light some very interesting information.

According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-mcflurry-machine-is-broken-again-now-the-ftc-is-on-it-11630522266"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the agency recently reached out to McDonald’s restaurant owners to collect more information on their experiences with the machines.</p><p>Why is the FTC looking into McFlurry machines, you ask? The answer may have something to do with the right to repair movement. At the start of July, President Biden ordered the agency to draft new rules to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html"><ins>empower consumers and businesses</ins></a> to repair their devices on their own. Later that same month, the FTC made good on that order, voting unanimously to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html"><ins>tackle unlawful repair restrictions</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By all accounts, McFlurry machines are a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqbm5/mcdonalds-franchises-hack-mcflurry-machines-to-bypass-sanitization-process"><ins>nightmare to repair</ins></a>. Moreover, Taylor, the firm that makes them, is at the center of a legal battle over measures it uses to prevent restaurants from repairing the machines on their own. When a McFlurry machine breaks down, only a certified technician from Taylor is allowed to fix it, leading to long wait times. Those wait times have increased during the pandemic. A federal judge <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymbp/why-the-mcflurry-machine-company-just-got-hit-with-a-restraining-order"><ins>recently sided with a company</ins></a> that produces a diagnostic tool that threatens Taylor’s monopoly on repairs.</p><p>The FTC hasn’t opened a formal probe yet. “The existence of a preliminary investigation does not indicate the FTC or its staff have found any wrongdoing,” the agency said in the letter it sent out this summer, according to <em>The Journal</em>. However, it reportedly wants to know how often restaurant owners are allowed to work on the McFlurry machines on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-mcflurry-letter-221312872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad6d1aba-c789-4fd0-9cdf-edbfd54bc576</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 22:13:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630534396</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T22:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mikhail Tereshchenko via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - AUGUST 3, 2020: A woman eats an ice cream in a street.

The social site has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/">banned</a> r/NoNewNormal and quarantined 54 other COVID-19 denial subreddits, but not over the false claims themselves. Instead, it&#39;s for abuse — NoNewNormal was caught brigading en masse (that is, flooding other subreddits) despite warnings, while the other communities violated a rule forbidding harassment and bullying.</p><p>The company didn&#39;t, however, relent on its approach to tackling the misinformation itself. Reddit said it clamps down on posts that encourage a &quot;significant risk of physical harm&quot; or are manipulations intended to mislead others, but made no mention of purging posts or subreddits merely for making demonstrably false claims about COVID-19 or vaccines.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit previously defended its position by arguing its platform was meant to foster &quot;open and authentic&quot; conversations, even if they disagree with a widely established consensus. However, that stance hasn&#39;t satisfied many of Reddit&#39;s users. <em>Business Insider</em><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/135-subreddits-are-going-dark-to-protest-reddits-refusal-to-ban-covid-disinformation/ar-AANYZHy">noted</a> 135 subreddits went &quot;dark&quot; (that is, went private) in protest over Reddit&#39;s seeming tolerance of COVID-19 misinformation, including major communities like r/TIFU.</p><p>Critics among those groups contended that Reddit let these groups blossom through &quot;inaction and malice,&quot; and that Reddit wasn&#39;t consistent in enforcing its own policies on misinformation and abuse. As one redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/hb7ovdd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">pointed out</a>, Reddit&#39;s claims about allowing dissenting ideas don&#39;t carry much weight — the COVID-19 denial groups are presenting false statements, not just contrary opinions.</p><p>The situation is a familiar one. Reddit was accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-opportunity-policy-change-002246893.html">dragging its heels on hate speech</a>, responding only when the outcry became too loud to ignore. The misinformation response suggests Reddit is repeating that behavior. Not that this would be shocking. The site often finds itself trying to balance its need to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-poltical-ads-new-policy-093954730.html">please advertisers</a> with a desire to foster free expression, and this is just the latest instance of that balancing act creating an uproar.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bans-covid-19-misinformation-communities-211159271.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dddf5a7e-9431-4adf-9e29-facd1fa12f8b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:11:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630530722</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T21:12:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e79752b0-0b61-11ec-bffd-e953d056bc92" width="4500" height="3004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e79752b0-0b61-11ec-bffd-e953d056bc92" width="4500" height="3004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2020/04/10: In this photo illustration a Reddit logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with a  COVID 19 sample on the background.

The body is only slightly bigger than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/red-6k-komodo-camera-available-083533822.html">Komodo</a>, but it touts a brand new, 35.4-megapixel VV full-frame sensor that offers a large 17 stops of dynamic range and &quot;cinema-quality&quot; scan times twice as fast as any other RED camera.</p><p>You might not have to sacrifice quality for speed, either. The V-Raptor ST can shoot 16-bit REDCODE RAW video at 8K and 120 frames per second, and you can ramp it up to 600 frames per second at 2K if you&#39;re capturing slow-motion shots. While RED may be stretching things by claiming you can &quot;always deliver&quot; at greater than 4K (you clearly need to step down in some situations), you might feel a twinge of regret if your production team spent close to $60,000 on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-the-cameras-youtubers-love.html">Monstro 8K</a> that &#39;only&#39; manages 60FPS at full resolution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new camera includes other creature comforts. A dedicated user display on the side helps assistants tweak settings and save presets, and improved cooling (including a quiet 60mm fan) helps you work in tougher conditions.</p><p>You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of ports, including two 12G-SDI outputs, nine-pin EXT (for breakout boxes), USB-C and the obligatory pogo pin connector for a monitor. ODU output on the side can break out to XLR or 3.5mm audio. Not surprisingly, you&#39;ll want fast storage — RED supports compatible CFexpress 2.0 Type B cards that can record R3D and ProRes at up to 800MB/s.</p><p>The price is squarely in pro filmmaker territory. The body alone sells for $24,500, and you&#39;ll likely want to spend $29,580 on a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; with useful add-ons like a 7-inch touchscreen, a RED 660GB CFexpress card (plus the matching card reader) and a pair of batteries. That&#39;s not including the RF-mount lenses and adapters you might need if you&#39;re new to the RED ecosystem. If you&#39;re the sort who regularly shoots 8K video for a living, though, this might represent a bargain if you&#39;re looking for high-end video equipment.</p><div id="58b10bdde9b24a158f89b41d87072b6f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmQ8huunigk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/red-v-raptor-st-8k-camera-200544378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32dca5ad-5e65-4fc5-9a01-de20b778ce4c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:05:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630526217</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T19:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Red]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX says Amazon is trying to delay Starlink because it can't compete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX isn&#39;t pulling any punches in its response to Amazon&#39;s latest stalling tactics.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/apple-asks-all-u-s-employees-to-report-vaccination-status?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company recently sent out a memo requesting workers, whether they currently work out of an office or not, to share that information by September 17th. Apple reportedly plans to use the data it collects to inform its ongoing COVID-19 response.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports the company told employees it would keep their vaccine status “confidential and secure” by aggregating the information but said that could change in the future. “It is possible your vaccination status may be used in an identifiable manner, along with other information about your general work environment such as your building location, if we determine or, if it is required that, this information is necessary in order to ensure a healthy and safe work environment,” Apple said in the memo, according to the outlet. It&#39;s not clear what repercussions if any an employee will face if they do not provide their vaccination status by the deadline.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to the company for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">Unlike Google</a>, Apple currently does not require employees to be vaccinated before they can come to the office. Still, the company has started to nudge its workers in that direction more forcefully. For example, it recently began a campaign encouraging workers to get their shot.</p><p>The company’s request, and the admission that the information employees share with it may be used in an identifiable manner, come as Apple faces increasing scrutiny over how it handles the privacy of its workers. A recent report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"><em>The Verge</em></a> detailed some of the company’s policies on that front. For instance, one such rule prohibits employees from wiping their work devices before returning them to the company. This latest policy may further fuel those concerns.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">618670f0-a7ad-4b66-a760-06975c640828</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 18:54:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630522562</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T18:56:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c6481c0-0b53-11ec-bff7-4a108c4a0897" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c6481c0-0b53-11ec-bff7-4a108c4a0897" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, UNITED STATES - 2020/02/23: Customers at the Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino.

Unfortunately, it appears that added flexibility will come at the cost of battery life. The new model can reportedly go six hours and 20 minutes on a single charge.
