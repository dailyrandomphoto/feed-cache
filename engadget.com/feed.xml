There&#39;s even a tablet holder on the weight tray to let you use your own screen and service. This might make sense if space is at a premium, or if you&#39;d rather not hog the TV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NordicTrack dumbbells are available now through Amazon <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells" href="https://amzn.to/3qijzHn">for $429</a>. That&#39;s expensive compared to many conventional adjustable sets, but you might not mind if the speed of adjustments is more important than price. We&#39;d add that some adjustable sets don&#39;t offer this level of flexibility — the 5lb changes could help you ease into heavier weights over time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nordictrack-iselect-adjustable-dumbbells-alexa-142942754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecfd3691-4b91-4c86-89ba-5e2ed5f401c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641911384</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:29:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NordicTrack from iFit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Nintendo Switch Online and microSD bundle is half off on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hunkering down for the winter months can mean more time to play some new games while you stay inside. For Switch owners that want to play with friends remotely and get access to classic games, a Nintendo Switch Online membership is well worth the price. Now, Amazon has a deal on a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3GgH6hl">bundle</a> that includes one year of the Switch Online family plan and a 128GB SanDisk microSD card for $35. Since both the membership and the card normally cost $35, you&#39;re essentially getting the extra storage for free.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GgH6hl" id="5ec6345d4609451e93384b3044469560" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Switch Online Family Plan bundle at Amazon - $35</a><p>At its debut, the main selling point of the membership was online play, but Nintendo has added more perks to it over the years. It now includes online backups for gameplay data, access to the Switch Online mobile app that lets you voice chat with friends while you&#39;re playing together, and access to a library of more than 70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-snes-switch-online-claymates-jelly-boy-bombuzal-150021227.html">NES and SNES</a> titles to play at any time. This particular bundle is best for those with large families, and possibly more than one Switch in the house, since up to eight users can take advantage of the membership&#39;s benefits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the things we usually recommend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-oled-accessories-150048703.html">new Switch owners</a> buy is a microSD card since it&#39;s easy to quickly fill up the console&#39;s built-in, 64GB of storage with games. The licensed 128GB SanDisk model included in this bundle is a solid one, with read speeds up to 100 MB/s and write speeds up to 90 MB/s. Even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need the extra space, you probably will as you collect more titles, save files and screenshots over time.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-and-microsd-bundle-is-half-off-on-amazon-141140268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">267a8846-43f4-444f-946f-5bd9752dc1c1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:11:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641909782</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:03:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SanDisk]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firefox Focus for Android will offer another way to prevent cross-site tracking]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Android version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-focus-mobile-updates-130514586.html">Firefox Focus browser</a> is getting another layer of privacy protection.

They agency says the marketplace will allow people to buy, sell and trade the tokens, which can be purchased using credit cards and crypto wallets.

With rapid test kits in short supply, though, some retailers are making them unaffordable by gouging customers. Now, the Biden administration has announced that testing kits must be covered by private insurance, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-says-private-insurers-to-cover-rapid-covid-19-tests-starting-saturday-11641848589"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>People covered by private health insurance can be reimbursed for up to eight tests a month per individual. To make things simpler, the White House is encouraging insurers to partner with retailers and pharmacies so people can pick up tests without paying up front or submitting a claim. The tests are available without deductibles, coinsurance or co-payment, so a family of four on the same health plan could be reimbursed for 32 tests a month, for instance. For such programs, reimbursement would be limited to $12 per test.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Today’s action further removes financial barriers and expands access to Covid-19 tests for millions of people.</p></blockquote><p>The new policy doesn&#39;t apply to Medicare, which counts more than 60 million seniors at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. However, Medicaid for low income folks already covers at-home COVID-19 tests authorized by the FDA. The administration also plans to make tens of millions of free tests available to uninsured Americans at health clinics and other sites, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/us/politics/insurance-covid-tests.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some insurers said that the administration is acting too late and that it didn&#39;t address the shortage of at-home tests.

No? Well it doesn&#39;t really matter anyway, because the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1480602635">Uber Watch app</a> has effectively been discontinued, according to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/10/you-cant-hail-an-uber-from-your-apple-watch-anymore?"><em>Apple Insider</em></a>. If you try to use it, a message pops up asking you to switch the mobile app instead. It further states &quot;we no longer [sic] supporting the Apple Watch app. Sorry for the inconvenience,&quot; with a crying emoji to drive the point home.&nbsp;</p><p>The app has yet to be pulled from the Watch App Store, but all you&#39;ll get is the error message if you try to use it. When it did work, it let you hail a ride, see the status of your request, and show the location of the vehicle. More advanced functions like fare-splitting were reserved for the smartphone app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The grammatically challenged message suggests that the app may have been pulled with some haste, though neither Uber or Apple have commented. The App Store listing (above) touts the app as a way you can leave home without your smartphone and still hail a ride, provided you had a cellular-enabled Watch. To be fair, Uber also pulled its WearOS app back in 2019, likely due to a lack of usage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-has-dropped-hailing-support-on-the-apple-watch-114057975.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa51e6a-2663-4c92-9fd2-784acb44e8dd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 11:40:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641907405</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T13:23:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dba4c1c0-72ce-11ec-83f3-c5e4f7746fb6" width="1023" height="658" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dba4c1c0-72ce-11ec-83f3-c5e4f7746fb6" width="1023" height="658" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Uber has dropped hailing support on the Apple Watch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Uber has dropped hailing support on the Apple Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will allow third-party payments for apps in South Korea]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple will soon allow developers to use alternative payment systems for their apps in South Korea to comply with the country&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-law-app-store-alternative-payments-114504007.html">new law</a>. According to <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220111000624"><em>The Korea Herald</em></a>, the tech giant has turned in its plans on how its app store would support third-party payments to the Korea Communications Commission. It reportedly didn&#39;t include details on when the changes to its store will take effect and how much it will charge for its service fees exactly. However, the company did say that its cut for alternative payment transactions will be smaller than 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>South Korea passed a law — dubbed the &quot;anti-Google law&quot; — last year that requires major app stores like Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s to allow third-party payment methods. It was a blow to the tech giants that typically keep a tight grip on their app stores. Both of them are even grappling with lawsuits challenging the commission they take from developers. Their most high-profile legal battle is perhaps the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-payment-changes-delay-epic-games-201026068.html">one with Epic</a>, which started after the video game developer tried to work around the companies&#39; 30 percent commission by offering discounts to users who purchase in-game currency directly from its portal.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Korean law states that companies will face fines if they refuse to comply and force developers to use their payment systems only. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html">submitted</a> its initial compliance plans shortly after the law took effect in September, revealing that it will lower its commission by four percent for transactions that don&#39;t use its own payment system. As for Apple, we&#39;ll likely hear more information in the coming months. A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users. Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea&#39;s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country&#39;s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49d5e913-3cbe-455f-b738-db9d570a6eb0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 10:55:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641898189</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T10:50:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4f1fb860-3083-11eb-9cff-f671bf61fd0c" width="4000" height="2668" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4f1fb860-3083-11eb-9cff-f671bf61fd0c" width="4000" height="2668" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - 2020/11/20: People entering the Apple store in Seoul, following the release of iPhone12 mini and iPhone12 Pro Max.

That&#39;s what Marlinspike has revealed in a <a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-year-new-ceo/">post</a> about stepping away his role over the next month, where he talked about struggling to do almost everything on his own before the Signal Foundation was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-signal-messenger-50-million-whatsapp-cofounder.html">formed</a> four years ago. The foundation provided the encrypted messaging app with $50 million in funding from WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, giving Signal the money it needed to be able to hire people and expand.&nbsp;</p><p>Before it had access to the funding, Marlinspike said he was writing all the Android and server code, facilitating all product development and solving issues the service may have had on his own.

The jump puts the country further behind meeting the reduction targets put forward by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-rejoin-paris-agreement-official-190909769.html">Paris climate agreement</a>. Under the deal, the US has pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions between 50 percent and 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. As of last year, they were 17.4 percent below that benchmark. That’s a step back from the 22.2 percent reduction the country had achieved the year prior.</p><p>Behind the increase in overall emissions were corresponding jumps in pollution generated by the country’s transportation and power sectors. Compared to 2021, those sectors generated an additional 10 percent and 6.6 percent of greenhouse emissions. Driving those increases was a 17 percent increase in reliance on coal-generated power and more people driving after a pandemic-related downturn.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report underscores how important is it is for the US to clean up its power grid and transportation sector. Another recent study found that wind and solar could meet <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wind-solar-energy-needs-study-172901659.html">85 percent</a> of the country’s current electricity needs.

The Canakkale region of Turkey hosts more than 1000 operating wind turbines. In November, Turkey's installed wind power capacity reached 10,585 megawatts making it the second-largest renewable capacity after hydropower. In October, Turkey ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, becoming the last country in the G-20 group to do so and setting an aim for net-zero emissions by 2053 and a focus on new climate initiatives. However, gas and coal continue to be the primary fuel sources in the energy sector, forcing the government to shift towards renewables, such as geothermal, hydropower, wind and solar energy. Over recent years, Turkey has increased installed capacity of renewable sources of energy as it endeavors to cut its near total dependence on imported petroleum products. Oil and gas imports, much of which are used to generate electricity, have become a significant strain on foreign exchange reserves especially as the country deals with a dire economic crisis with the Turkish lira losing more than 40 percent of its value against the U.S dollar this year. However according to Turkey's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Donmez, Turkey’s power capacity in renewable energy reached approximately 53,000 megawatts at the end of October, and, on November 11, electricity production from wind power hit a historic daily record, generating 20.1 percent of total power. Turkey’s renewable energy capacity is predicted to grow by 50 percent from 2021 through 2026, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Would it?</p><p>Very clearly, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:VideoMic Go II" href="https://fave.co/3zMxjgm">VideoMic Go II</a> was designed to sit atop a camera. That’s just a fact, but with USB and 3.5mm outputs and compatibility with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-connect-podcasting-app-000034018.html">Rode Connect</a> – the company’s USB-friendly podcasting app – it turns out this lightweight, $99 mic could be more versatile than it first seems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you <em>are</em> looking for a mic for your DSLR, know that the VideoMic Go II has a cold shoe mount, the aforementioned 3.5mm out (which can also be used for monitoring) and it comes bundled with a Rycote shock mount and a windscreen in the box. There’s no secondary/safety/stereo recording here or on-mic gain control, but that’s normal for something in this price range.</p><p>Performance-wise, the sound is surprisingly rich for a mic of this size without sounding too “dead.” There’s no notable difference between the audio you get out of the USB port compared to the 3.5mm port bar a little variation in gain. When comparing it against Rode’s VideoMic Me and VideoMic NTG, the VideoMic Go II might well be my favorite of the bunch. It’s natural, focused with just the right amount of ambiance/sense of space.</p><p>Where the VideoMic Go II gets more interesting is how it performs in <em>other</em> use cases. When plugged into a computer and placed on a desk the VideoMic Go II sounds just as robust as far more expensive dynamic microphones. So much so it threw me for a moment.</p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this is when I tested it against the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$400" href="https://amzn.to/3FhXugn">$400</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">Shure SM7B</a> and Rode’s own $99 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:NT USB Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3Fj0cC9">NT USB Mini</a>. Given that both of the Rodes in this test are condenser microphones and cost about the same, you might think those two would be the nearer match, but it turns out that the VideoMic Go II sounded <em>much</em> closer to the SM7B. This isn’t to say it’s as good as the SM7B (there’s a little more depth in the Shure and a touch more dynamic range perhaps) but given the disparity in price, it definitely wasn’t expected.</p><p>This similarity is further compounded when you consider that the different type of capsule – Rode’s condenser versus Shure’s dynamic – alone would typically give them a very different sound. You can hear all three microphones in the sample below. It starts with the Shure, then the VideoMic Go II and then the NT Mini. The transition between the first two is subtle, yet the last one is obvious. Oh, and the VideoMic Go II was about two inches further away from my mouth than the SM7B was.</p><div id="3a616b0aa8e14bbeb2a3a29b0803f3b3"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0FsbAY7" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Of course, this is just one test, in one scenario in one specific room. But for a quick comparison of what a $400 mic can do off the cuff compared to a $99 one, it’s a good starting point. Despite the lack of on-device controls, there are some configurable options via Rode Central. When connected to the app (mobile or desktop) you’ll have the option to tweak the gain level, apply a high pass filter / high-frequency boost and adjust the monitoring volume. It’s less convenient than physical on-mic controls, but still allows you some control over how it sounds or responds to different inputs. (If you&#39;re wondering, the audio above starts with the SM7B and switches to the VideoMic Go II at &quot;two condenser microphones&quot;).</p><p>Given that Rode added compatibility for Connect, and the USB option makes it phone and tablet-friendly, suddenly the VideoMic Go II could very well be a good all-rounder for the price. A mic that has video chops but can also do double duty as a podcast mic (and, therefore an all-purpose computer mic) there appears to be a lot of bang for the veritable buck.</p><p>Of course, if you really do need something that records a safety channel, has physical variable gain controls or if XLR connectivity is a must, this isn’t the one to go for. But for most general creator uses? It finally might not entirely “depend on what you’re recording.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rode-video-mic-go-ii-230059221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c854d539-d36a-4adc-9d4f-cb7a68e3f8bc</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 23:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641911053</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:24:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II - a new versatile shotgun microphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surgeons successfully transplant genetically modified pig heart into human patient]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a desperate effort to save the life of a 57-year-old man, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have accomplished a medical first. Per <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-heart-transplant-6651614cb9d73bada8eea2ecb6449aef?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a>, this past Friday, surgeons successfully transplanted a pig heart into a patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><p>In doing so, they showed a genetically modified animal organ could survive and function within the human body without immediate rejection. Three days after the procedure, David Bennett, the individual who underwent the surgery, is alive and “doing well,” according to the hospital.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Food and Drug Administration authorized the procedure on compassionate grounds. Bennett was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant and had run out of other options. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” he said in a statement before doctors operated on him.</p><p>Scientists have tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-25-transplant-organs-from-human-pig-hybrids.html">save humans with animal organs</a> for decades. One of the most notable attempts occurred in 1984 when doctors grafted a baboon heart into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Fae"><ins>Stephanie Fae Beauclair</ins></a>, an infant born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The congenital disorder left her body incapable of circulating blood properly. Baby Fae, as she was better known, survived for 21 days before her body eventually rejected the transplanted organ.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, what makes this latest procedure different is doctors used a heart that had been genetically modified to remove four genes that encode a molecule that causes the body to reject the orphan organ. They also inserted six human genes to make the immune system more tolerable of the foreign tissue. Whether the experiment represents a breakthrough will depend on what happens next. Bennett’s body could still reject the pig heart.

The 3D-printed attachment snaps onto the left thumbstick. When it&#39;s placed on a surface (or one&#39;s thigh), physically moving the entire controller will move the thumbstick. The L1 and L2 buttons are replicated on the right side of the controller.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s a second, optional attachment that offers inputs for the D-pad as well. So, save for the Share button, players would be able to use the entire controller with one hand.</p><div id="89c7ed5e3fb9430b9025522cb098db1d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PVwTudk9DWk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Because the DualSense is symmetrical, Kuumeri says the attachments can be reversed to fit on the other side of the controller. You&#39;d just need to mirror the components before printing them.&nbsp;</p><p>Kuumeri submitted the adapter to <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/110609-one-handed-dualsense">a contest</a> for one-handed controller designs. You can <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/110609-one-handed-dualsense">download the files </a>and print attachments for personal use.</p><p>The adapter could also prove useful for gamers who don&#39;t typically have issues using the DualSense with both hands. In a video, Kuumeri demonstrates the ability to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>, a co-op-only game, solo by using attachments on two controllers. The attachment could also give players a way to munch on a snack or enjoy a beverage without having to hit the pause button.</p><p>Kuumeri&#39;s design won&#39;t mitigate all players&#39; accessibility issues. Some may tire of moving the controller around physically or they may not have the dexterity to access all four shoulder buttons with one hand. Still, the attachment could afford many more people the chance to play games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-interview-ps5-151025038.html"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/returnal-review-ps5-shooter-133029657.html"><em>Returnal</em></a> — as long as they have access to a 3D printer and are actually able to secure a PS5.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/3-d-printed-dualsense-attachment-ps-5-one-hand-accessibility-174915143.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">39aa5962-2647-427a-be85-56dc50d95d87</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 17:49:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641836957</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T17:49:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/84223a90-723d-11ec-b4f7-10a02e7e6d46" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/84223a90-723d-11ec-b4f7-10a02e7e6d46" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Akaki Kuumeri/YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PS5 DualSense controller with an attachment that makes games playable with one hand.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PS5 DualSense controller with an attachment that makes games playable with one hand.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peacock's 'Bel-Air' reimagines The Fresh Prince's origin story in first trailer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Bel-Air, </em>Peacock’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nbc-peacock-bel-air-series-140155022.html">modern-day reinterpretation of <em>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</em></a>, will debut on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:February 13th" href="https://fave.co/3GfSbzg">February 13th</a>, the streamer announced on Monday and shared a first-look trailer. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nbc-peacock-bel-air-series-140155022.html">Announced back in 2020</a>, <em>Bel-Air</em> re-envisions the classic ‘90s sitcom as an hour-long drama series.
