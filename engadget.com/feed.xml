To take advantage, you’ll need a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a>, as well as an iPhone or iPad with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-review-130053409.html">iOS 14</a> installed on the device. The toggle to enable the feature is located in the Control Center. As this is a slow rollout, you may not see the toggle even if you have the latest version of Netflix installed on your iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Spatial audio uses head-tracking to widen the soundstage of a movie or TV show and make it feel like the entire room you’re in is being filled with sound. The result is a more immersive experience. Netflix is a bit late to support spatial audio. Some of the more popular apps where you could use the feature before today include Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. Still, there are just as many platforms where it’s not available. More notable examples include YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, making this a significant milestone for the feature all the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37f8a657-780e-4a62-9ec2-cb5a60d06945</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 23:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629323898</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T21:58:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9810b5f0-006d-11ec-bfdf-d574d7747aa2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9810b5f0-006d-11ec-bfdf-d574d7747aa2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter updates developer API to make Spaces easier to find]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is working to make Spaces more discoverable.

PILLSID involves two separate parts. One component is an internal insulin dispenser that a doctor would surgically implant in your abdomen. The other is a magnetic capsule loaded with the hormone.</p><p>Anytime you need to refill the dispenser, you take one of the pills, and it travels down your digestive system until it reaches the point where the device is implanted near your small intestine. Using the power of magnets, the device rotates the capsule into position and then punctures it with a retractable needle and pumps the refill of insulin into a reservoir. The cool thing here is that the dispenser charges wirelessly, limiting the number of interventions a doctor needs to maintain the device. Once the capsule is empty, it continues its trip down your digestive system until you eventually poop it out. Good times.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the surface, the system may sound scary, but in a lot of ways, it’s preferable to many of the current tools you can use as a type 1 diabetes patient to regulate your blood sugar levels. Insulin pumps, for instance, involve a tube or needle that you need to self-administer. One jab might not be so bad, but some people need to get multiple injections per day. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s scary to think about a docking station inside the body, but it worked,&quot; Arianna Menciassi, one of the co-authors of the study, told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-operates-docking-station-inside-the-gut"><em><ins>IEEE Spectrum</ins></em></a>. Unintuitively, this is a much less intrusive system, and it has the potential to be useful for administering other life-saving drugs.</p><p>In a test involving three diabetic pigs, the research team found the system could successfully manage their insulin levels for several hours. In some instances, they found bodily fluids from the pigs would leak into the robot. So as a next step, the team is working on sealing the device better.</p><p>While it will likely be some time before PILLSID makes its way to hospitals, devices that attend to your medical needs from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-09-edible-robot-surgeons-cure-from-inside-out.html"><ins>inside your body</ins></a> are likely to become more and more common.

A New York-led coalition of 31 states and territories is <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-co-leads-bipartisan-coalition-calling-fda-regulate-e">pressuring</a> the Food and Drug Administration to regulate flavored e-cigarettes.

Since then, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-thom-browne-edition-teaser-173338204.html">every foldable Samsung has launched</a> has come in a special Thom Browne (TB) version. Just 3,500 units of these limited edition bundles are available each time, and according to Browne, “they <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/thom-browne-edition/">sell out</a> supposedly in minutes.”</p><p>This year, Samsung is offering the Thom Browne bundles of the Fold 3 and Flip 3 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip3-5g/thom-browne-edition/buy/galaxy-z-flip3-thom-browne-edition-sm-f711uzuyxaa/">for $3,449 and $2,349 respectively</a>. Each box comes with TB-themed versions of the foldable, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Buds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/web/express/cart/#/cart-info/?addItem%5B%5D=EP-P6300TWEGUS%2C1">wireless charger trio</a> and a selection of cases and straps. The regular Fold 3, Buds 2, Watch 4 and wireless charger cost $1,799, $150, $250 and $80 respectively, bringing the total to about $2,280, not including the cases and straps. So you’re paying about $1,000 more for the Thom Browne aesthetic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The packaging for the special edition Fold 3 bundle is extravagant. Each device has its own labelled container and sits in slots carved out inside a giant box. Thankfully, most of the packaging is paper, so I didn’t feel too guilty about the environmental impact. A drawer beneath the devices holds all the accessories, like a pair of TB-themed straps for the watch, a case for the Fold 3 and covers for the Buds 2’s charging case. There’s also a special S Pen Pro in the Fold bundle that’s white with blue and red stripes on the inside.</p><div id="7f4db45d5f174cda85b5ee13f7c11c93"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yf8i1V5hEA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>All the devices have Thom Browne branding on them, and this year’s set features the designer’s signature stripes in red, white and blue. It’s a deliberate selection of colors meant to be an homage to American sportswear, but also acknowledge that it’s an Olympic year.</p><p>“The reference to the red, white and blue, and specifically the white with the red trim felt very reminiscent of old Olympics and old Olympics uniforms,” Browne told Engadget. “I love sports, I love athletes, I’ve been so inspired by athletes at that level,” he said. (He’s a swimmer, in case you were wondering. And while we’re in a parenthetical, I’m a thrower.)</p><p>But the stripe-centric design and familiar color scheme have always been a part of the Samsung bundles, which Browne said is “something that feels very signature to me.” He’s made sure to keep recognizable elements from his brand on them, because he felt people “would have been disappointed if it were to be approached any differently.”</p><p>Not only does the motif appear on the Galaxy devices’ externally, the Fold 3 and Watch 4 also have custom wallpapers in TB themes. The default background on the special edition Fold is covered in the designer’s signature gray-and-white vertical lines with a small postage stamp-esque square in the middle as the clock widget. At the top center of the screen is a small band of the red-white-and-blue pattern that’s reminiscent of a fabric bookmark. System icons and fonts match the overall theme as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/82f26e40-005c-11ec-b9fe-325f7b8e0f6b" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 Thom Browne edition" data-uuid="ea69a566-7e50-31ea-8456-2c29e4053510"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though there aren’t any differences in size between the TB edition devices and their standard counterparts, the shiny metal finish on the branded Fold and Watch make them feel sleeker somehow. I also vastly prefer the Thom Browne watch straps to Samsung’s boring, chunky versions. And though there isn’t much room on the buds for the company to add design flourishes, I love that it still managed to paint little strips of red-white-and-blue on each headphone. Though in that shape, they look like color-reversed French flags.</p><p>Now that the Thom Browne versions of these devices are in their third iteration, the designer is pretty familiar with the process of coming up with them. Each edition has taken about a year to create, and Browne said that the “most important thing for these collaborations is that you see the best from both parties.”</p><p>For Browne, the partnership has been a “really good, very supportive, mutually respectful relationship” that’s lasted over 15 years. Though the special edition foldables have only been around for about two years, Samsung has carried his collections in its stores in the past. But the opportunity to create a Thom Browne version of the original Z Flip was intriguing.

The agency is looking into a string of collisions between Tesla vehicles and parked emergency vehicles, one of which resulted in someone&#39;s death.

Now the Eurorack sibling of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-effects-beebo-review-modular-guitar-pedal-touchscreen-151557875.html">Beebo</a> is finally shipping to customers eager to start building the synth modules of their dreams on an easy to use touchscreen.</p><p>Inside Hector is a collection of over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-effects-merges-digit-and-beebo-into-one-super-guitar-pedal-namm-044854562.html">100 different modules</a> that you can combine and connect to create your own synth voices, modulation sources or effects and then use them with your existing Eurorack setup. The beauty here is that the Hector can be whatever you want it to be: a boring utility module like a mixer or an attenuator, an emulation of a Mutable Instruments oscillator or a crazy convolution reverb built around the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/poly-effects-beebo-convolution/s-9EYsCtEtlF9">sound of a bong rip</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Hector itself is a 30 HP unit with six ins and eight outs, all of which can be used either for audio or control voltage (CV). There&#39;s also MIDI in and out via 3.5mm TRS jacks and USB.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a29e77f0-0054-11ec-9ef3-390e5e4cb764" alt="Poly Effects Hector" data-uuid="f31cc537-b9d0-31e7-a872-de52d4e0bdc5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Poly Effects</div></figure><p>The Hector runs basically the same firmware as the Beebo, so everything I said was great about that pedal when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-effects-beebo-review-modular-guitar-pedal-touchscreen-151557875.html">I reviewed it</a> still stands. Plus, Poly Effects has made some big improvements in the months since. For one, there are a few new modules, including a proper looper which is something I had dinged it for lacking. Additionally responsiveness has been improved and there a bunch of tiny bug fixes as well. And, since they run the same software you can use existing Beebo presets on the Hector.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some differences worth noting though: While the Beebo had two encoders and a trio of footswitches the only controls for the Hector are on the touchscreen. If you want to take more control you&#39;ll need to hook up an external controller.&nbsp;</p><p>If you didn&#39;t preorder a Hector you&#39;ll be in for a bit of a wait, though. Batches one and two are sold out and the third one isn&#39;t expected to ship for about three weeks. But you can still secure yourself a future Hector for $599 over at the <a href="https://www.polyeffects.com/polyeffects/p/hector">Poly Effects</a> site.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/poly-effects-hector-virtual-modular-synth-eurorack-shipping-191039451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41602f19-5a0c-46d4-a004-34775006d706</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 19:10:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629316712</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T19:58:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/91734820-005e-11ec-9fbf-1396699c974d" width="1920" height="1218" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/91734820-005e-11ec-9fbf-1396699c974d" width="1920" height="1218" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Poly Effects]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Poly Effects modular synth.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Poly Effects]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook has banned 3,000 accounts for COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Facebook has taken a much tougher stance on health misinformation than it has in the past, removing millions of posts for sharing misinformation.

The company said it would evaluate how it gathers and shares information for future reports. The company also said that more than half of posts that users see in their News feeds comes from their family and friends, not from pages or groups they follow.

The militant group has swiftly overtaken Afghanistan&#39;s civilian government, taking <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/16/middleeast/taliban-control-afghanistan-explained-intl-hnk/index.html">control of the capital Kabul</a> in only a few days, far sooner than intelligence analysts expected. Just like every modern organization, the Taliban relies heavily on social media to spread its messaging and communicate with followers, which puts the onus on technology companies to secure their platforms.&nbsp;</p><p>“The Taliban is sanctioned as a terrorist organization under US law and we have banned them from our services under our Dangerous Organization policies,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. &quot;This means we remove accounts maintained by or on behalf of the Taliban and prohibit praise, support, and representation of them.&quot; They went on to note that the company will be following the situation closely with the help of native Dari and Pashto speakers, who serve as local experts. Facebook isn&#39;t making any additions to its existing policies, which cover its core app, Instagram and WhatsApp, but it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s making the Taliban&#39;s uprising a priority.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, that statement doesn&#39;t mean much if Facebook can&#39;t actually see what&#39;s happening on its platforms. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yvy5/whatsapp-says-its-not-banning-the-taliban-because-it-cant-read-their-texts"><em>Vice </em>reports</a> that the Taliban has been spreading its message on WhatsApp, which uses end-to-end encryption to secure conversations. The company could technically ban specific accounts, but it won&#39;t be able to easily search and remove content like it can on Facebook proper and Instagram.</p><p>Twitter, meanwhile, wouldn&#39;t say if it would ban notable Taliban accounts like spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/suhailshaheen1">Suhail Shaheen&#39;s</a>. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/tech/facebook-twitter-taliban-hnk-intl/index.html"><em>CNN reported</em></a> yesterday that he had 347,000 followers on the platform, but now he&#39;s amassed over 361,000, a clear sign of growing influence. Twitter noted that people were using its service to seek help in Afghanistan, and that it would continue to enforce its existing rules around things like the glorification of violence and hateful conduct. The company also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-report-misleading-tweets-202011787.html">introduced the ability to report misleading tweets</a> yesterday.</p><p>While Twitter is shying away from any definitive stances against the Taliban, a spokesperson noted: &quot;Our enforcement approach is agile and we will remain transparent about our work as it continues to evolve to address these increasingly complex issues.&quot; Basically, the rules could change at any moment.</p><p>YouTube is taking a stronger stance, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/tech/facebook-twitter-taliban-hnk-intl/index.html">telling CNN</a> that it would be terminating accounts run by the Afghan Taliban because the group appears on the US Treasury Department&#39;s sanctions list.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, it&#39;s unclear how social media companies will recognize the Taliban as it takes control of Afghanistan. As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"><em>Washington Post reports</em></a>, it&#39;s up to social media firms to determine who maintains official state accounts like the <a href="https://twitter.com/ARG_AFG">Afghanistan President&#39;s</a> Twitter, which now has over 926,000 followers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-twitter-taliban-afghanistan-content-151603761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1934b7c0-b23b-4c0b-aec5-64a9fb6e7f0f</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:16:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629300368</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T15:26:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa963f20-0035-11ec-bffb-b00956152962" width="4315" height="2872" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa963f20-0035-11ec-bffb-b00956152962" width="4315" height="2872" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - AUGUST 18, 2021: Demonstrators including former interpreters for the British Army in Afghanistan protest in Parliament Square against Taliban and demand human rights in Afghanistan as MPs hold a debate on the crisis in Afghanistan in the House of Commons on August 18, 2021 in London, England.

It&#39;s a brand-new open-world adventure set in the Hisui region (later known as Sinnoh), and it takes place long before the events of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remakes-nintendo-switch-154100706.html"><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.</em></a></p><div id="f6aad7ecd84e4e649d47aa3a0aa1528f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRsbFmM37T4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Since this is a different spin on the Pokémon formula, developer Game Freak has revamped the battle system, taking a similar approach to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-29-what-final-fantasy-x-did-differently-over-x-years-ago.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy X</ins></em></a>. Battles are still turn-based, but rather than Pokémon each taking a turn, their respective stats and other facets such as items dictate the order of actions and how many each creature gets to take.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pokémon might take multiple turns in a row, so you might take the opportunity to dish out multiple attacks on the spin or take time to heal up in between. Each of your Pokémon&#39;s four moves has two styles: agile style and strong style. The former speeds up your action speed and might bump up your next turn in the queue, but the move will be weaker than unusual. You can unleash a more powerful attack if you opt for strong style, though you might need to wait longer to act again. It&#39;s clear you&#39;ll need to rethink your battle strategies to be successful here.</p><p>Not only can you sneak up on wild Pokémon through tall grass to hurl a wooden Poké Ball at them, you can use smoke bombs to conceal yourself. Wild Pokémon also might attack before you deploy a Pokémon of your own. Battles will start right away rather than moving to a battle-specific screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eed6e120-0031-11ec-bf6c-596552d3fd0d" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Pok&#xe9;mon Legends: Arceus" data-uuid="f3996ca3-f750-3db5-ba0f-c0bfefe89b04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Pokémon Company</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, the trailer featured another look at the game&#39;s gorgeous visuals and other gameplay. It has expansive vistas that feel a bit reminiscent of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>.

They&#39;re quickly becoming less intrusive, however. <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/eco-friendly-vehicles-offer-quieter-cleaner-safaris-kenyan-reserve-2021-08-17/">notes</a> that the Kenyan-Swedish firm Opibus is converting diesel and gas safari vehicles in Kenya&#39;s Maasai Mara National Reserve into electric models.&nbsp;</p><p>The converted EVs are not only quieter, but don&#39;t rumble or spew foul odors that might alarm animals. Many of the other benefits of electric cars apply here, too. Opibus&#39; conversions don&#39;t produce CO2 emissions, and the company claims that electric motors cut operating costs in half by ditching fuel (and, we&#39;d add, the quirks of combustion engines).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Opibus is the only company performing these conversions in Kenya, and it has only electrified 10 vehicles so far. There are also practical challenges to deploying safari EVs. African electrical grids aren&#39;t always reliable, and charging an EV in a nature reserve isn&#39;t as simple as finding a public station. There&#39;s also the simple matter of range — safari companies can&#39;t necessarily afford hours of downtime to recharge vehicles in between tours.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to imagine EVs finding widespread adoption in Kenya, South Africa and other countries where safari tourism is vital. The less intrusive the vehicles are, the more likely it is that wildlife will continue unimpeded. That&#39;s good for both the animals and the tourists hoping to spot elephants and lions that might otherwise stay away.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kenya-safari-ev-144021490.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eab85ad2-0346-4fb6-9374-d12656248533</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:40:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629299414</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T15:10:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/81b3ad80-002c-11ec-b6df-33e5002df133" width="2785" height="1838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/81b3ad80-002c-11ec-b6df-33e5002df133" width="2785" height="1838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Monicah Mwangi / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sylvester Mukenye, a tour guide at the Emboo River Camp drives an electric-powered safari vehicle during a game drive safari at the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, Kenya July 16, 2021.

Some players feel the detachable controllers are a bit small for their hands. Many players miss having a regular D-pad. Whatever your reasons for wanting to upgrade your Switch controller situation, know that there are alternatives — it’s just a matter of picking the one that fits your needs. We tested out a bunch of Switch controllers to see which are worth your money.</p><h2>For casual gaming: Joy-Cons</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/fedbf520-b70c-11ea-b5f7-4b676ea0ed7d" alt="Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, there’s a lot to like about the included Joy-Cons. They come right in the box and can be separated from the system so two people can play. The system also includes a special gamepad grip so you can hold them in your hand like any standard controller. So if you are in fact, happy with your Joy-Cons, there’s no need to switch them out. Just tweak them a little depending on your needs. Find them a tad too small? <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:FastSnail&#x002019;s matte rubber shells" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX">FastSnail’s matte rubber shells</a> can make them a little easier for large hands to hold, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s Analog Caps" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT">Hori’s Analog Caps</a> can make the thumb sticks grippier.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX" id="165bb9e542ee46e4929cbbc34f0817f5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy FastSnail grips at Amazon - $14</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT" id="24d8076612314c338cd949aeddf836b1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hori analog caps at Amazon - $9</a><p>There’s really no good way to replace the Joy-Cons entirely with a third-party copy. Some Joy-Con-like controllers won’t connect wirelessly, while others lack key features like vibration or an NFC reader. But there are some tradeoffs that are worth it. For example, if you like to play a lot of 2D platformers in handheld mode, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s D-pad controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-D-Pad-Controller-Mario-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AI0GLJK?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=2a04ce4ebec72336c640709fe326be7d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Hori’s D-pad controller</a> will restore the beloved cross-shaped directional button to your gameplay. If you’re looking for something that’s also more comfortable in your hand, the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Split Pad Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3ARNI2G">$50 Split Pad Pro</a> is also worth a look. It has a D-pad on the left side and a more ergonomic grip than your standard set of Joy-Cons. But it also makes the entire assembled Switch a lot chunkier.</p><p>If you like to play your Switch with groups (or you’ve experienced the dreaded “drift” issue), chances are you’ve picked up one or two extra pairs of Joy-Cons. Which means you’re going to need a place to charge the spares. PowerA makes an excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 charging station" href="https://amzn.to/3suORtL">$25 charging station</a> that can be plugged into your Switch dock (or any device with a USB port) and handles four Joy-Con-like controllers at once — that includes third-party gamepads as well as Nintendo’s own Switch-compatible NES controllers (see below).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-D-Pad-Controller-Mario-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AI0GLJK?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=2a04ce4ebec72336c640709fe326be7d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" id="7cf77477e01b453b9ec620fb662eb490" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hori D-pad controller at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ARNI2G" id="20f5a4b1ad6448d490f769dfe9d3f059" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Split Pad Pro at Amazon - $88</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3suORtL" id="552ad00a8dc84228bda55be515981e06" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA charging dock at Amazon - $25</a><h2>For action-packed games: Pro-level controllers</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/824ed110-b70e-11ea-a930-d4e643dbdacb" alt="Nintendo Switch Pro Controller" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes you just want a standard controller to play your favorite action titles — and standard in 2020 means something like you’d get packed in with an Xbox, with grips for the heels of your hands, shoulder buttons and triggers, two thumb sticks, a set of four buttons on the right and a D-pad on the left. Nintendo knows that, which is why it created the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pro Controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Pro Controller</a>. This first-party gamepad pairs easily with the Switch and features a D-pad on the left, while still maintaining features like the infrared sensor and vibration that might go missing on third-party alternatives. The only downside is the $70 price, but avid players of games like <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> will appreciate the refined controls and increased comfort.</p><p>While you can plug your Pro Controller directly into your Switch dock to charge, it’s not the most elegant solution. PowerA also makes an attractive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 dock" href="https://amzn.to/3xXI90w">$25 dock</a> that accommodates both Joy-Cons and the Pro Controller, which should keep your gaming area nice and tidy.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US" id="902971f09c77412e84713a600659796b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Pro Controller at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xXI90w" id="c53ee8e68e7643a8b0c42bad30e8d84d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA dock at Amazon - $25</a><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/a5dcfd50-b70e-11ea-beff-f17a637298b5" alt="PowerA Nintendo Switch Pro Controller" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>When the price of the Pro Controller is a bit rich for your blood or out of stock, PowerA makes its own version with the same arrangement of buttons. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Enhanced Wireless Controller" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9">Enhanced Wireless Controller</a> skips the rechargeable battery in favor of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:AAs" href="https://amzn.to/2YvqfUq">AAs</a>, which has its downsides, but at least when it runs low on juice you can just pop in a new pair of batteries and get right back to gaming. Unfortunately, there’s no USB-C port to connect with so you’ll have to pair the device wirelessly — which can be finicky and may take a few tries before your Switch recognizes the controller. It also lacks vibration, so you won’t get tactile feedback in games where it’s helpful. And the plus and minus buttons are placed a bit closer to the center, so those with smaller hands will have to reach a bit further to press them.</p><p>If you’d prefer not to have to recharge — or buy batteries for — your gamepad, PowerA also makes a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:wired version" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG">wired version</a> of the same controller that connects via USB. It’s got the same look and feel, but you won’t have to struggle as much with getting your console to recognize it, and there’s no potential for wireless lag, making it ideal for fast-paced shooters and fighting games. The included cord is 10 feet long so it should reach most couches just fine.</p><p>While most third-party controllers tend to mimic the Xbox style of gamepad, anyone more familiar with the PlayStation’s distinctive DualShock design will probably prefer the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ">$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo</a>. The retro-styled controller has the same general layout as the classic SNES gamepad, but adds twin thumb sticks, palm grips, back buttons, control remapping and even sensitivity adjustments. It’s truly the Swiss Army knife of Switch controllers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9" id="6d26d9c3bce64d42ab3b8b72a9ba8a85" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Enhanced Wireless controller at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG" id="fb8cbc19a5b34dc7a9df0e0c2d97183a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA wired controller at Amazon - $23</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ" id="64f0cd38ccb140dbacb3ebfe31fe788d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8bitdo Pro 2 at Amazon - $50</a><h2>For old school gaming: Niche and retro controllers</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/1064ad40-b70e-11ea-a37f-e099d7f62310" alt="PowerA GameCube-style controller for Switch" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Twenty years later and the preferred controller layout for Super Smash Bros. players is still the one made for the GameCube, which is why today it’s still possible to buy new gamepads straight from Nintendo.

The dog-bone shape of the <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-controller.html">$30 SNES model</a> is more hand friendly and can still be used with the NES games, so it’s a better use of your funds should you decide you want to recreate your childhood gaming experiences.</p><p>If you don’t need an exact copy of your beloved childhood gamepads it’s worth looking at 8BitDo instead: It makes a variety of classic-styled controllers that add just enough modern features to make them useful for a wider variety of games. Its models are almost all wireless, and there are some design changes to make the controllers more comfortable and easier to use. We’ve already recommended the DualShock-like Pro 2, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$45 SN30 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3k3QHhJ">$45 SN30 Pro</a> also offers features like dual thumb sticks and vibration in the dog-bone controller style.</p><p>If you’re looking for something more portable, however, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 8BitDo Lite" href="https://amzn.to/2XGUw4Z">$25 8BitDo Lite</a> is smaller and swaps out the thumb sticks for two D-pads, keeping the four button arrangement on each side. It’s great for 2D games and it even matches the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-8bitdos-latest-switch-controller-ditches-thumbsticks-for-dual-d.html">color scheme</a> of the Switch Lite.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you try any of the controllers listed in this guide, remember to update your Switch to the latest firmware — the 8BitDo controllers will run on any version, but the PowerA gamepads need your system to run at least version 6.0.0.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2VXl4yn" id="284687668bd1482e8b7e8a616f5e6f40" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nintendo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy NES controller pack at Nintendo - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2UqUywk" id="db9b92a9b1144a82ae6eaf32a423786f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nintendo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy SNES controller at Nintendo - $30</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3k3QHhJ" id="4b2445b09cdd4cc1ac927ad4ad74c257" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy SN30 Pro at Amazon - $45</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2XGUw4Z" id="7c823c795f2b4a8cb0b8433f53749841" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8bitdo Lite at Amazon - $25</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">061a64f7-f700-3ab7-bd52-51c3b52edbcd</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629295368</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T14:03:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[gaming]]></category><category><![CDATA[nintendo]]></category><category><![CDATA[8bitdo]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[nintendoswitch]]></category><category><![CDATA[gamepads]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[sn30]]></category><category><![CDATA[powera]]></category><category><![CDATA[hori]]></category><category><![CDATA[switch]]></category><category><![CDATA[splitpadpro]]></category><category><![CDATA[procontroller]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[controllers]]></category><category><![CDATA[joy-cons]]></category><category><![CDATA[sn30pro+]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e81da260-002c-11ec-86a7-3261231674cc" width="1600" height="899" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e81da260-002c-11ec-86a7-3261231674cc" width="1600" height="899" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The best Switch controllers for every player level]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Laser-powered fusion energy inches closer to reality]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have just edged closer to a fusion energy system that doesn&#39;t lean on magnetic field-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kstar-fusion-device-sets-record-210817623.html">tokamak reactors</a> or twisty <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-04-stellarator-fusion-reactor-online.html">stellarators</a>. <em>Science</em><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/explosive-new-result-laser-powered-fusion-effort-nears-ignition">reports</a> that a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-experiment-puts-researchers-threshold-fusion-ignition">achieved</a> a breakthrough in laser-powered fusion energy by coming much closer to &quot;ignition,&quot; or a blast that produces an excess of energy.</p><p>The researchers sparked the event with a 20-nanosecond burst from 192 laser beams aimed at a tiny sphere full of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, itself housed in a small gold cylinder. The laser shot vaporizes the gold, producing x-rays that implode the capsule and create fusion. The experiment produced 70 percent ignition, or 1.35 megajoules of the 1.9MJ from the laser. That&#39;s well short of what you&#39;d need from a fusion energy source, but eight times more powerful than the lab had managed before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will take a while for the research unit to further refine the process and achieve full ignition. There&#39;s also a large gap between achieving ignition and making a practical fusion power system — you&#39;d need to produce these fusion blasts a rate near 10 per second to collect energy from the resulting neutrons.</p><p>The test does show that laser-based fusion is a much more realistic prospect than first thought, however. If there&#39;s further progress, the technique could produce effectively &#39;unlimited&#39; energy that could solve the electrical grid&#39;s capacity issues while remaining clean and safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/laser-powered-fusion-energy-breakthrough-134058739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b23d0ea8-6bdd-4263-9228-d8240623b8f1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:40:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629313112</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T18:58:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Holoride’s in-car VR gaming system leaves the track for the real world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e5d3dcd837024cfbbe3d277e5427e3f7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWVmkAICPYw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Holoride’s VR gaming system for passengers caught our attention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html">a few years back at CES</a> when we were given a ride in an Audi on a track and had the game react to the movement of the vehicle while we played. Well, the company is back and this time they demoed two games and threw off the shackles of the track for the real world.</p><p>We took a ride in an Audi with the Holoride system and again enjoyed video games while someone else drove. The company is currently courting developers to build games via their recently announced SDK and are partnering with automakers to make sure that the data they need from the car to make their games a reality is available.

The visual discovery website has introduced hair pattern search, it said, with BIPOC users in mind. This new feature uses computer vision-powered object detection to enable users to refine their searches by six different hair patterns: protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight and shaved/bald.</p><p>Now, after users search for broader terms like &quot;summer hairstyles,&quot; &quot;glam hair&quot; or &quot;short hair,&quot; they&#39;ll find new hair pattern buttons that will narrow down the results. The feature is now live in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on desktop, as well as on iOS and Android. It will roll out to more locations over the coming months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, there are different types of curls, not to mention different hair textures and porosities, and Pinterest said its technology detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on its platform. Being able to refine results could help POC users find styling inspiration more easily instead of having to wade through pages and pages of hair images that wouldn&#39;t work for their hair types. That said, it remains to be seen how accurate the feature is and if it&#39;s truly effective in sifting through images on the website.</p><p>According to the company, this feature builds on its first inclusive product that allows users to search for images based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-skin-tone-search-updates-161657313.html">subjects&#39; skin tones</a>. It worked with BIPOC creators and popular Pinners like <a href="https://www.pinterest.ph/NaeemahLaFond/">Naeemah LaFond</a> to design the product.</p><p>Pinterest&#39;s Head of Inclusive Product Annie Ta said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our mission on the Inclusive Product team is to help everyone feel like Pinterest is a place for them. As a visual discovery platform, we have an opportunity and responsibility to do a better job of increasing representation in the products we build. That&#39;s why we built hair pattern search using computer vision technology to help identify hair patterns in images. By doing this, we hope we&#39;re able to use technology for good and make it easier for people, no matter who they are, to find hair inspiration for them on Pinterest.&quot;</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b4a75e60-001a-11ec-bfef-cb4e28508bdc" style="height:1000;width:750;" alt="Pinterest" data-uuid="25f15e7a-8cea-3a1b-843a-9fc7417350f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pinterest</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-hair-pattern-search-130002097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c2ac252-b8c3-48bd-85d3-1d9820f5bbe5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629288275</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T12:04:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hair Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Beauty]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's latest earbuds are for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of companies make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-14-assistive-hearing-wireless-earbuds-bragi-nuheara.html">&quot;hearing enhancement&quot; devices</a> that look more like a set of earbuds than a piece of clinical tech. Nuheara has been a staple at CES with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-nuheara-iqbuds2-max.html">IQbuds line</a> and companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-bragi-project-ears-hearing-aids-tinnitus.html">Bragi</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-olive-union-smart-ear-hands-on.html">Olive</a> and others have offered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-upgrade-your-hearing-with-technology.html">a mix of tech and hardware</a> to assist with hearing loss. Even Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-features-ios-15-180549807.html">plans to introduce a &quot;Converstaion Boost&quot;</a> for its AirPods Pro. Since the FDA allows companies to sell directly to consumers with mild-to-moderate hearing loss without the need for a prescription, the list of options is constantly growing. Another company that&#39;s specifically equipped to blur the line between hearing aid and true wireless earbuds is Jabra, thanks to the auditory assistance expertise of its parent company GN.&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra Enhance Plus" href="https://fave.co/2W6Pn53">Jabra Enhance Plus</a>, the company offers a more approachable device for people who may not need what all-day hearing aids offer just yet. Jabra describes these earbuds as &quot;a miniaturized true wireless form factor&quot; that&#39;s 50 percent smaller than its stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Elite 75t</a> model. Those are already some of the smallest buds I&#39;ve tested, so reducing the size even further makes the Enhance Plus more comfortable and more discreet. Plus, a design that resembles earbuds rather than a traditional hearing aid helps reduce the stigma around wearing something that helps your hear better.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, four separate sound processing features work to improve audio quality. The Enhance Plus analyzes sound to keep things as natural as possible while also reducing noise for speech clarity. The earbuds also ensure feedback doesn&#39;t hinder amplification and they isolate sounds coming from in front of you.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/505c8fb0-ffbc-11eb-9bfd-ec1ab9582668" alt="Jabra Enhance Plus" data-uuid="82a97309-19eb-3a9c-bf58-193ba002e456"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>In addition to providing hearing enhancement, the Jabra Enhance Plus can work just like a set of true wireless earbuds to play music and take calls. Similar to other earbuds, the Enhance Plus comes with multiple sizes of ear tips to help you find the best fit, on-board controls and water/dust resistance (IP52). Jabra says they&#39;ll last 10 hours on a charge with 30 hours total when you factor in the charging case. An app assists with setup and offers a degree of customization.&nbsp;</p><p>Jabra plans to launch the Enhance Plus at &quot;select hearing care clinics&quot; in the US &quot;towards the end of the year.&quot; A licensed professional will conduct a hearing test to make sure these earbuds are appropriate. There&#39;s no word on pricing just yet, but the company says it&#39;s applying for approval under the FDA&#39;s self-fitting category. If you&#39;re looking for more of a true hearing aid rather than these &quot;enhancers,&quot; Jabra also offers the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Enhance Pro" href="https://fave.co/37Vvvoc">Enhance Pro</a>. It carries the more traditional behind-the-ear hearing aid design along with a charging case. It&#39;s also pricey, starting at $1,800.&nbsp;</p><p>If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose SoundControl hearing aids</a> went on sale in May, and as of last week, are available in all 50 states. That device puts the company&#39;s audio expertise to use to help you hear better, and Bose said it was the first FDA-cleared hearing aids that could be sold directly to consumers. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re more affordable at $850, but they run on the typical zinc-air batteries for hearing aids rather than being rechargeable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1:13PM ET: </strong>Bose SoundControl hearing aids are now available in all 50 states after a limited rollout at launch.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Streambar" href="https://amzn.to/2VZw2Tw">Roku Streambar</a> is back down to $99, or 24 percent off its normal price, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Streaming Stick+" href="https://amzn.to/3APQgOG">Streaming Stick+</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Express 4K+" href="https://amzn.to/3srNvjy">Express 4K+</a> are down to $40 and $29, respectively.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2VZw2Tw" id="e621429abde647f1bf2edc7e12f50cb5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roku Streambar at Amazon - $99</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3APQgOG" id="82587845eb6f4ce395b01ed217e1dc24" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon - $40</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3srNvjy" id="76f4df8262ac473e865cac427ec3bd02" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roku Express 4K+ at Amazon - $29</a><p>If you have an older TV in your home or a smart TV with software that you&#39;re not a huge fan of, Roku&#39;s Streambar can revamp your system when it comes to audio as well as streaming. It earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-review-133013675.html">score of 86</a> from us thanks to its compact size — it&#39;ll easily fit into almost any setup — solid audio quality with Dolby Atmos support and its built-in 4K HDR streaming tech.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;re essentially getting a soundbar that doubles as a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Ultra" href="https://amzn.to/3gcfe34">Roku Ultra</a> (albeit without Dolby Vision support), so movies and TV shows will sound better and you&#39;ll have access to all of the streaming services on the Roku platform including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, HBO Max and more. It also works as a Bluetooth speaker as well, but we found the device sounded better when watching action movies than when playing our favorite pop playlists.</p><p>The other discounted Roku products are best for those aren&#39;t as interested in an audio upgrade as they are in streaming power that comes in a small package. The Streaming Stick+ has ended up in many of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-home-entertainment-streaming-devices-cheap-tvs-for-students-123020749.html">home entertainment guides</a> thanks to its affordability and relatively comprehensive feature set. It supports 4K HDR streaming, long-range wireless connectivity and voice commands with Alexa and the Google Assistant. The Express 4K+ is very similar, but it supports smooth wireless connectivity instead of long-range. Both dongles also come with Roku&#39;s voice remote as well.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-roku-streaming-stick-plus-express-4k-plus-sale-amazon-125053085.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e3afdd4-487d-41a8-83aa-c292c5183eee</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 12:50:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629290666</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T12:44:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9eebbc20-1794-11eb-bdf6-57147dff10c6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9eebbc20-1794-11eb-bdf6-57147dff10c6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Streambar soundbar on a white table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Streambar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is removing ads from its One UI Android apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s insistence on shoving ads into its stock apps has detracted from its otherwise stellar phones.
