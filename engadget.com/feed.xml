Apple’s newest base model iPad is now on sale, and we’ve got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html">detailed review</a> on what is an incremental upgrade on what is, at heart, the same design we’ve had for many years now.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/447a4be1-22a0-11ec-b6ef-0aa12ce3a674" style="height:427;width:640;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="c2abcdc2-7fc7-3952-9279-bffb9b7af08e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>If you’re looking for an iPad with a design twist — or at least a smaller footprint — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">there’s the iPad mini</a>, pulling some of the redesigned iPad Pro DNA into a smaller package. That includes something close to an “all-screen” design, with an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display and power button with TouchID on the edge that supplants the need for a home button.</p><p>Meanwhile, the OG iPad design, so very lightly refreshed for 2021, doesn’t put a foot wrong — and it’s the cheapest new iPad you can get. For that $330, as Nate Ingraham’s review lays out, the hardware is powerful and the battery life is outstanding.</p><p>It has Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which first appeared inside the iPhone 11, circa 2019, but still an upgrade from the last vanilla iPad iteration. But yes, it’s not as powerful as the newer chips in the iPad Air and just-updated iPad mini.</p><p>If we sidestep the Pro models, tablet shopping will boil down to the iPad mini, Air or this new standard model. You could say this is some degree of choice — I just wish there was more tablet competition that didn’t run an Apple OS. Android tablets are still, typically, cheaper options that always leave me wanting.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-employees-working-condition-criticisms-090134228.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Amazon settles with employees allegedly fired for criticizing work conditions</a></h2><h3>The former employees were outspoken critics of many Amazon policies.</h3><h3></h3><p>Amazon was supposed to defend its decision in court to let Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa go last year.

Now, the Federal Communications Commission is <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-rules-prevent-sim-swapping-and-port-out-fraud">seeking</a> to create new rules that would help prevent SIM swapping scams and port-out fraud, both of which are techniques designed to hijack people&#39;s phone numbers and identities.&nbsp;</p><p>The commission said it has received numerous complaints from consumers &quot;who have suffered significant distress, inconvenience and financial harm&quot; as a result of both hijacking methods. SIM swapping is a technique wherein a bad actor convinces a wireless carrier to transfer a victim&#39;s service to a phone they control. When a bad actor successfully transfers the victim&#39;s service and number to another carrier, that&#39;s called port-out fraud.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make it harder for scammers to gain control of potential victims&#39; phone numbers, the FCC wants to amend the Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) and Local Number Portability rules. In particular, it wants to require providers to adopt more secure methods in authenticating a person&#39;s identity before agreeing to transfer their service to a new phone or to another carrier. The commission also proposes a rule that would require providers to notify customers whenever a SIM switch or a port-out request is made on their accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the FCC&#39;s rulemaking process, the public can now comment on these proposals. The commission still has to read those proposals and offer the public another chance to make their voice heard before it can decide whether to amend the aforementioned rules.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fcc-proposes-new-rules-sim-swapping-scams-093840753.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b22c7fc1-7239-413a-9bc0-2d629135ddd3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 09:38:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633081160</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T09:39:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Financial Fraud Prevention]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec6b0f70-229a-11ec-9fc3-751afcc2590d" width="5053" height="3600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec6b0f70-229a-11ec-9fc3-751afcc2590d" width="5053" height="3600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PHILIPPE HUGUEN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture taken on Februrary 27 ,2015 in Lille, northern France, shows cellphone sim cards.

Now, the company has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-expects-renewable-energy-powered-us-sites-by-2025-ahead-plan-2021-09-30/">announced</a> that it will be well ahead schedule on the &quot;how&quot; part, using 100 percent renewable energy across its US operations by 2025 — five years ahead of schedule.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve the goal, GM said it would increase energy efficiency and source renewables for its facilities. It also plans to create technology to store renewable energy over the medium and long term and &quot;create microgrids that help deploy renewable energy.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>“We know climate action is a priority and every company must push itself to decarbonize further and faster,” said GM Chief Sustainability Officer Kristen Siemen. “That’s what we are doing by aiming to achieve 100 percent renewable energy five years earlier in the US.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>It also detailed plans to work with a company called PJM Interconnection to track energy usage based on carbon output of the grid at any given time. &quot;When the power being supplied consists mostly of fossil fuels, GM can make informed decisions about tapping into stored renewable energy or reduce the amount of power being consumed,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the vehicles it produces, GM plans to have 30 EVs globally by 2025, and still plans to &quot;eliminate tailpipe emissions for new light-duty vehicles (i.e., cars, SUVs and pickups) by 2035.&quot; The wording suggests that could include hydrogen-powered cars, though GM appears to be focusing mostly on EVs.&nbsp;</p><p>GM&#39;s plans to reduce pollution have drifted with the political winds, however. It was one of several automakers that backed the Trump administration&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-trump-administration-national-emissions-standards.html">plan</a> to bar California and other states from setting their own pollution and zero-emission requirements. That would have allowed manufacturers to raise fuel efficiency by just 1.5 percent per year, well below the previous administration&#39;s five percent requirement. GM withdrew from the litigation shortly after Joe Biden was elected President.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-us-factories-will-switch-to-renewable-energy-five-years-ahead-of-schedule-085010165.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">217141ac-471b-4798-af2a-0697e5ed49a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 08:50:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633078215</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T08:50:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08c8d550-228f-11ec-bcfd-a54d0ce9bcf8" width="3500" height="2317" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/08c8d550-228f-11ec-bcfd-a54d0ce9bcf8" width="3500" height="2317" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rebecca Cook / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Chevrolet Bolt EV vehicle is seen on the assembly line at General Motors Orion Assembly in Lake Orion, Michigan, U.S., March 19, 2018.

The parties have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/30/business/scarlett-johansson-disney-black-widow.html">reached</a> a settlement for the lawsuit Johansson filed over the hybrid release strategy used for<em> Black Widow</em>. If you&#39;ll recall, the actor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">sued Disney</a> over the company&#39;s decision to release her movie in theaters and on Disney+ at the same time, accusing the entertainment giant of breach of contract.&nbsp;</p><p>Johansson&#39;s camp argued that <em>Black Widow</em> was supposed to be released in theaters exclusively under her deal with Marvel. According to the lawsuit she filed, she could lose as much as $50 million due to the hybrid release, seeing as her compensation is tied directly with the movie&#39;s box office success and doesn&#39;t include a cut from what Disney would make from streaming. People have had to pay $30 for a Premier Access pass to watch the movie on Disney+, and the company said <em>Black Widow</em> earned $60 million from streaming during its opening weekend.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Her lawsuit also said that her camp tried to contact Disney and Marvel to re-negotiate their deal, but they were allegedly unresponsive. Neither party disclosed the terms of their agreement, but both issued a statement mentioning future collaborations. Alan Bergman, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, said he looks &quot;forward to working together on a number of upcoming projects, including Disney&#39;s <em>Tower of Terror</em>.&quot;</p><p>Meanwhile, entertainment workers are gearing up for a strike because studios like Disney are rapidly producing content after pandemic-related restrictions had lifted. The situation led to poor working conditions with long hours and no breaks for production crew. Entertainment unions are hoping to convince studios to make changes, including ending the lower pay scale for smaller streaming services. Under the current rules, streaming services with fewer than 20 million subscribers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-showbiz-union-tv-service-20-million-subscribers-124041017.html">Apple TV+</a> does can pay their workers lower wages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f6d2323-df8f-43df-89b6-84fb696b8c63</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 02:48:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633056555</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T02:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/7ec51aa0-fdc6-11ea-bef6-c4c819b17fd3" width="5340" height="3772" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/7ec51aa0-fdc6-11ea-bef6-c4c819b17fd3" width="5340" height="3772" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alberto E.

The first of those new is Clips, a tool people can use to share previews of public rooms. When creators and hosts enable the feature, you’ll see a new icon that looks like a pair of scissors. Tap it and Clubhouse will capture the last 30 seconds of audio, which you can then share on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, iMessage or WhatsApp. Clubhouse says it’s rolling out Clips in beta to select creators today. In most public and open rooms, you should see the scissors icon there unless the host has gone out of their way to disable the feature.</p><p>Sometime in the next few weeks, Clubhouse also plans to introduce a way for people to share archives of past live rooms. The feature is called Replays. As with Clips, it’s something that people will be able to disable if they want. When active, however, it will make past rooms discoverable for as long as a host or creator wants people to find that conversation. Clubhouse says it plans to start rolling out Replays sometime in October.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rounding things out, Clubhouse is introducing a search tool that allows you to look for specific people, clubs, live rooms and future events. Initially, that functionality will live in the Explore tab for about a week or two before Clubhouse moves it to the hallway sidebar. Last but not least, Android users can look forward to Clubhouse rolling out support for spatial audio. In many ways, the updates Clubhouse announced today address shortcomings that have been in the app for a while. The absence of a way to share audio was a particularly notable omission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-clips-update-224758709.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebe711f3-781e-4865-bed4-2b0d42337ed8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 22:47:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633040291</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T22:18:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/cf8a81c0-983d-11eb-bea7-3cb591324653" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/cf8a81c0-983d-11eb-bea7-3cb591324653" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Clubhouse Drop-in audio chat app logo on the App Store is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 6, 2021.

The system was never implemented in part due to security concerns that came up when the FCC and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) started looking into the feasibility of the idea. Specifically, there was a worry that a bad actor could use the registry to flood a call center with automated calls and thereby prevent them from helping people in need.</p><p>Fast forward to the present and the FCC says it has a better idea on how to accomplish the goal assigned to it by Congress. On Thursday, the agency <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-376195A1.pdf"><ins>proposed new rules</ins></a> that would require telephone companies to block robocalls made to those facilities. As Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-376195A2.pdf"><ins>points out</ins></a>, the advantage of this approach is that it would limit access to the do-not-call registry to a select group of verified telephone companies and carriers. And by limiting access to that list, the FCC and FTC can put in place better safeguards to protect it. With today’s decision, the FCC isn’t ready yet to implement that system, but what it does plan to do is collect feedback before moving forward. “We believe this is a promising approach, but we want to get this right,” Rosenworcel said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fcc-911-robocall-rulemaking-215014128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d56f069-4bf0-4590-a533-2c396b9c48f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:50:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633034664</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T20:44:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/de00d930-833e-11ea-bff3-4db48f8abfc0" width="2919" height="1945" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/de00d930-833e-11ea-bff3-4db48f8abfc0" width="2919" height="1945" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nick Oxford / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[REACT EMS paramedics wearing protective gear load a potential coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patient for transport in Shawnee, Oklahoma, U.S. April 2, 2020.

And once again, the Facebook executive — today it was Head of Safety Antigone Davis —  seemed to do her best to dodge the most difficult questions.</p><p>But the latest hearing on teen <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms">mental health</a>, which came in response to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667">reporting</a> from <em>The WSJ</em>, was different from past hearings. That’s because, thanks to a whistleblower, members of the Senate Commerce Committee now have access to thousands of internal documents written by the company’s own researchers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The documents, some of which have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html">made public</a>, paint a very different picture of Facebook and Instagram’s understanding of how their services impact teens’ mental health than what they’ve publicly portrayed. Those documents are in the hands of lawmakers, making the findings that much harder for Facebook to spin. The disclosures have already forced Facebook to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html">&quot;pause&quot; work</a> on an Instagram Kids app.</p><p>“We now have a deep insight into Facebook&#39;s relentless campaign to recruit and exploit young users,” Senator Richard Blumenthal said at the start of the hearing. “We now know, while Facebook publicly denies that Instagram is deeply harmful for teens, privately, Facebook, researchers and experts have been ringing the alarm for years.”</p><p>This has forced Facebook into the uncomfortable position of trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html"><ins>downplay</ins></a> the significance of its own research. “This is not bombshell research,” Davis repeated multiple times during the hearing. One day earlier, Facebook released <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">heavily annotated</a> versions of two of the documents, with notes that also tried to explain away its own findings. Those documents, which were just two of the “thousands” Blumenthal said he now has access to, used words like “myopic” and “sensationalizing” to try to minimize findings like the fact that Instagram makes “body images worse for 1 in 3 teen girls.”</p><p>The tactic didn’t go over well in the Senate on Thursday. “This research is a bombshell,” Blumenthal said. “It is powerful, gripping, riveting evidence that Facebook knows the harmful effects of its site on children, and that it has concealed those facts and findings.”</p><p>As with past hearings, there were some cringey moments. At one point, Blumenthal demanded to know if Facebook would “commit to ending finsta” — a reference to the secondary accounts often used by teens to stay anonymous. That forced Davis to awkwardly explain that so-called “finstas” are not an official Instagram feature. At another point, Sen. Ted Cruz demanded Davis explain why she wasn’t appearing at the hearing in person (she cited COVID-19 protocols).</p><div id="23b579854166480db1ebba0c0b6c6ea6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the full exchange. Unlike Sen. Orrin Hatch in 2018 (who was mocked based on a clip that was taken out of context to suggest he didn&#39;t know Facebook runs ads), the longer clip in this case doesn&#39;t really get any less awkward for Sen. Blumenthal. <a href="https://t.co/dn0LCmdiQ4">https://t.co/dn0LCmdiQ4</a></p>— Will Oremus (@WillOremus) <a href="https://twitter.com/WillOremus/status/1443653437028188164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>But even with those moments, it was difficult to ignore the significance of these issues. It may seem obvious, but kids and teens are incredibly important to the company, which is consistently behind rivals like TikTok and Snapchat for that demographic. So much so that a former employee who worked on Messenger Kids<a href="https://twitter.com/srsaliba/status/1442928661796032514"><ins> recently said</ins></a> that “losing the Teen audience was considered an &#39;existential threat,&#39;” for Facebook.</p><p>Worse for Facebook, there are very likely more bombshells coming. The whistleblower who provided the documents to <em>The Journal</em> and lawmakers, is appearing on <em>60 Minutes</em><a href="https://twitter.com/60Minutes/status/1443398981690793989">Sunday night</a>. And she is testifying at a separate Commerce Committee hearing <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/10/protecting%20kids%20online:%20testimony%20from%20a%20facebook%20whistleblower"><ins>next week</ins></a>. So while Facebook executives may be able to dodge questions and insist that their researchers’ conclusions have been mischaracterized, it will be much harder to rebut someone who was closely involved with that work.</p><p>Some senators hinted that there would be more to come at the next hearing. Senator Ray Luján asked Davis whether “Facebook ever tested whether a change to its platform increases an individual&#39;s or a group of users&#39; propensity to post a violent or hateful language.” Davis said that it wasn’t her “area of expertise.”</p><p>“We might get more responses to that one next week,” he said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">102bd54b-63ba-4383-a522-f3a498eba47d</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 21:03:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633035798</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T21:03:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-05/b7601350-6d7c-11e9-b65c-02babef6dcaf" width="5025" height="3350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-05/b7601350-6d7c-11e9-b65c-02babef6dcaf" width="5025" height="3350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Attendees walk past a Facebook logo during Facebook Inc's F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 30, 2019.

Financial terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed. Rumors that Sony was buying Bluepoint started to spread online right around the time the company acquired <em>Returnal</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">Housemarque</a> in late June. Sony didn’t say whether Bluepoint will continue to focus its efforts on remastering past titles or if it will work on an entirely new IP now that it’s part of the PlayStation Studios family.</p><div id="50cbecb658d9469aa3924b5948e53102"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing the next member of the PlayStation Studios family… <a href="https://t.co/mRDLD5KwDM">pic.twitter.com/mRDLD5KwDM</a></p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1443591628606689280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>“PlayStation has such an iconic gaming catalog and for us there’s been nothing better than to bring some of gaming’s masterpieces to new players,” said Marco Thrush, the president of Bluepoint Games. “Becoming a part of PlayStation Studios empowers our team to raise the quality-bar even further and create even more impactful experiences for the PlayStation community.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the announcement of today’s deal, Sony has acquired three studios in the past year. That number increases to four over more than two years if you include its 2019 purchase of <em>Spider-Man</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html">Insomniac Games</a>. That’s a significant change of pace for a company that was previously much slower to buy up external developers to bolster its first-party lineup. But then a lot has changed in just the last year. Microsoft’s recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">$7.5 billion deal</a> to buy Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media means many highly anticipated games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html"><em>Starfield</em></a> aren’t coming to PlayStation anymore.

The retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:original Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/VyNzXA">original Nest Hub</a> smart display for $40, or $50 off its normal price. This gadget came out in 2018 and has since been replaced by the sleep-tracking, second-generation Nest Hub — but if you&#39;re willing to skip a few new features, you can get a largely similar device for one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/VyNzXA" id="86404e31a7164d79b608e77778bae8cf" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub (1st-gen) at Best Buy - $40</a><p>We gave the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-google-home-hub-review.html">original Nest Hub</a>, formerly known as the Google Home Hub, a score of 87 when it first came out for its lovely 7-inch display, charming minimalist design and extra privacy thanks to a lack of a camera. It makes a good smart alarm clock, even if it is slightly larger than something like the Echo Show 5, but it also won&#39;t look out of place on your kitchen countertop. It can even act as a digital photo frame if you use Google&#39;s Live Albums feature. Plus, you can control smart home devices from its touchscreen, and it&#39;ll show feeds from Nest security cameras so you can check in on any area of your home more easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So what will you miss out on if you opt for the previous-generation device instead of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:new Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/b3V4d9">new, $100 Nest Hub</a>? It comes down to three main things: the Soli motion sensor, improved audio and a speedier Google Assistant. The Soli sensor enables gesture controls as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html#sleeptrackingbyradar">sleep tracking</a>, so you could position the new Nest Hub on your nightstand and it will track things like time asleep, sleep quality and snoring. We weren&#39;t super impressed by the device&#39;s nighttime tracking abilities, but we expect improvements to be made in future software updates.</p><p>As for sound and the Assistant, the new Nest Hub has the same audio system as the Nest Audio speaker, so it&#39;s a big improvement over the original. Plus, the onboard machine-learning chip allows the Assistant to respond more quickly to queries and commands. Overall, the latest Nest Hub is an improvement on the original, but the first-generation device remains a solid option if you&#39;re on a strict budget or if you feel you can safely skip the latest upgrades.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-first-generation-40-deal-best-buy-151238609.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d33a959a-2e73-450e-8da4-fe7f6a41cc56</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 15:12:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633014762</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T15:12:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2018-10%2Fd6676b10-d572-11e8-adfe-dadc329587f2&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=0ff8302bc589704cb41bf76038633c057f3ea7b2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2018-10%2Fd6676b10-d572-11e8-adfe-dadc329587f2&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=0ff8302bc589704cb41bf76038633c057f3ea7b2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google&#39;s original Nest Hub drops to $40 at Best Buy]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's quiz will help you find a new podcast based on your listening habits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last year alone, almost 1.5 million <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/podcast"><ins>podcasts</ins></a> have been added to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/spotify"><ins>Spotify</ins></a>.

And why not? Back in 2017, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-06-apple-ipad-2017-review.html">introduced its cheapest-ever iPad</a> as a budget option for schools or people who don&#39;t need top-of-the-line specs. This device has always used hardware that’s a few years old — but Apple’s chips are so powerful that this hasn’t been an issue. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-a13-bionic-171718680.html">Now in its ninth generation</a>, though, the form factor is starting to feel stale; it&#39;s virtually unchanged from the iPad Air that Apple released back in 2013. Then again, at this price who cares?</p><p>It’s not a tablet meant for early adopters like me. It’s for those who want a fast, lightweight tablet with a nice display and tons of apps, without having to spend too much or consider whether a device like the iPad Pro is the future of computing. As such, there are just a few basic questions I want to answer with this review. If you have an old iPad, what’s new and better about this one? And if you don’t have an iPad, is this the one to buy?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>What’s new</h2><h2></h2><p>To make that evaluation, let’s recap what’s new about the ninth-gen iPad. The processor powering it is Apple’s A13 Bionic chip, which first appeared in inside the iPhone 11 from 2019. It’s one year newer than the A12, which powered last year’s iPad, and it’s faster and more efficient than its predecessor. Naturally, it’s slower than the newer chips powering the iPad Air and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">just-updated iPad mini</a>, but it still delivers more than enough horsepower for a $330 tablet.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f9eb7241-4fbb-45c7-8f15-b1f8ed53e69f"/><p>I didn&#39;t experience any noticeable slowdowns, whether I was multitasking between Slack, writing this review in Google Docs, juggling various tabs in Safari or playing Apple Arcade games. Since this iPad has less RAM than the iPad Pro I use as my daily driver, I noticed that apps needed to refresh their content more frequently when I was heavily multitasking. But everything was quick to load up and I was back on my way again in no time.</p><p>For most people’s “standard iPad” use cases — browsing the web, editing photos, playing games, watching movies, messaging, drawing or taking notes with the Apple Pencil, writing emails or working on documents with the Smart Keyboard folio — the A13 Bionic is more than powerful enough. In fact, in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-2020-ipados-14-review-170023713.html">our review of last year’s iPad</a>, we found the device capable of easily transcoding and exporting 4K video into 1080p clips. It wasn’t as fast as the iPad Pro, but it was still faster than we anticipated. The A13 will only help if you’re the kind of person who likes to push their hardware.</p><p>Another new thing about the 2021 iPad is you get double the storage for the same amount of money. That means the $329 iPad has 64GB of storage this year, while the $479 comes with a healthy 256GB. As usual, you can also add LTE connectivity to these devices for an additional $130. (I reviewed the 256GB model with LTE, which costs $609.) This change is easy to evaluate: More storage is better, and it was sorely needed, particularly on the base model. 64GB should be enough for most people, but if you want to load up the iPad with games and save a lot of movies and photos to local storage, spring for the 256GB model.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/320077e1-21ed-11ec-85bd-323f05a14aff" alt="Apple iPad (2021) review photos" data-uuid="ec14b536-9a89-329b-948d-deded16d5197"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPad’s display is essentially unchanged from the prior two models. It’s a 10.2-inch touchscreen with 2,160-by-1,620 pixel resolution. There is one change to the screen, though: It has Apple’s True Tone technology for the first time, which automatically adjusts the color temperature based on the ambient light in the room around you. Apple has offered this feature on more expensive iPads and all of its iPhones for years now, so it’s nice to see it finally in use at the lower end.</p><p>The display otherwise looks good whether you’re watching videos, playing games or browsing the web. It’s not nearly as good as the screens on the other iPads that Apple sells, though. I’m used to my iPad Pro screen, which is laminated directly to the front glass and has a 120Hz refresh rate with support for the wide P3 color gamut. But, after just sitting down and using the new iPad, I mostly didn’t think about these things. For a $330 device, it’s perfectly usable; pleasant, even. I did notice the “air gap” on the new iPad that comes from not having its display bonded to the glass, but I can accept that as a cost-cutting measure.</p><p>Finally, Apple put a new front-facing camera on the new iPad. In a somewhat surprising move, it’s the same one used on the iPad Pro (minus all the depth sensors and extra hardware needed for Face ID). It’s also identical to the one inside the new iPad mini. It’s a 12-megapixel shooter with an extremely wide field of view. That wide angle enables a feature Apple calls “Center Stage.” When you’re on a FaceTime call, the camera automatically crops in around you, rather than show the full 122-degree field of view. But since the camera has all that space to work with, it can follow you as you move around the frame. It’s an interesting feature, though usually I’m stationary during video calls. It does do a decent job of making up for the fact that the iPad’s front camera is off-center when you’re using the iPad in landscape mode, though.</p><p>I imagine Center Stage is something that will feel handy once you start to use it regularly, and I’m generally glad to see that Apple seems to have recognized that the iPad needed a better front camera. The 1.2-megapixel FaceTime camera on older iPads just doesn’t cut it in this current moment where we&#39;re all constantly on video calls.</p><h2>What’s old</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/31fe7c10-21ed-11ec-a13e-2f885eaefa79" alt="Apple iPad (2021) review photos" data-uuid="a6ca9bc3-54db-312b-8592-9b5c2da4e66d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Everything else about the new iPad remains unchanged. It’s the same size and weight as the last two models and features the same size screen. It has the same sizable bezels, 8-megapixel back camera, Lightning port for charging (not USB-C) and a home button with Touch ID built in. It works with the first-generation Apple Pencil (sold separately for $99), which Apple has offered since late 2015, plus the Smart Keyboard folio ($159) that Apple built for the 10.5-inch iPad Pro back in 2017. There are still two speakers at the bottom when you’re holding it in portrait orientation, which means audio still comes at you from one off-center spot when you’re watching a video. But, there’s a headphone jack!</p><p>This means it’s not the most exciting device for someone like me, but there are otherwise a lot of benefits to Apple keeping things unchanged. For one, someone replacing an iPad they bought a few years ago will be able to use the same chargers and accessories as before — something that’s particularly important for education programs and other institutions that bought  iPads in bulk.</p><p>As always, Apple says the iPad’s battery lasts for 10 hours of browsing the web or watching videos over WiFi. I got a little less than that when using the iPad and its keyboard for a full day of work, but the iPad far surpassed that estimate when I was watching videos. I got closer to 14 hours before the battery finally kicked it. Naturally, you’ll enjoy less runtime when doing more intensive tasks like gaming.</p><h2>Living with iPadOS 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/31ffdba0-21ed-11ec-b8bc-7c1c48ea2247" alt="Apple iPad (2021) review photos" data-uuid="f6bb960f-9f78-3fbb-b55b-396ac0c6af35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Despite the ho-hum design, the user experience felt fresh, thanks largely to iPadOS 15. I’ve been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html">using the updated software in beta</a> since the summer, and I’m glad to say that the final release is solid. Apple addressed the biggest problems I had with iPadOS 15 (some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fix-safari-tab-bar-design-third-ios-15-mac-os-monterey-beta-180648751.html">illogical design changes to Safari</a>), and many of the changes make the iPad experience significantly better.</p><p>Quick Notes is a great feature for Apple Pencil users and makes the iPad a much better note-taking device. Obviously, it’s handy to be able to quickly summon a new space to scribble in, but the fact that Notes recognizes when you’re on a website or specific Map location and lets you save them to the note is particularly useful.</p><p>Now that Safari has restored a traditional tab view instead of the cramped compact view from iPadOS 15 betas, I can appreciate some of the other changes this year to the browser. Tab Groups are a convenient way to organize things when you want to separate out what you’re browsing by category; I often use it to keep research for stories all in one place. And being able to find links that were shared with me through the Messages app is handy, too.</p><p>The variety of new multitasking gestures took a little getting used to, but they make it easier to set up various spaces with the right combination of apps for what you’re trying to do. The iPad’s 10.2-inch screen is almost too small for doing much in multitasking mode, but it’s still useful to have a bunch of my most-used apps a swipe aways in Slide Over. And the new “shelf” that appears when you launch an app to show you other spaces the app is running in is another smart addition I’ve been using a lot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/31ff8d80-21ed-11ec-97fe-c1f73612a952" alt="Apple iPad (2021) review photos" data-uuid="efbe0d2c-25d0-357e-b78a-4ac6150af4e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Other new changes are taking me longer to set up the way I’d like. The notification summary feature, which lets you set up a time for notifications from specific apps to be delivered, is a clever idea in theory. But I haven’t yet figured out which apps I want to relegate to the summary and which ones I&#39;d rather show up immediately. Similarly, the new Focus features let you set up multiple do not disturb scenarios, each of which can have its own schedule, apps or people allowed or blocked and home screens that are hidden or active. It’s extremely flexible, but I haven’t yet figured out how to make the most of it.</p><p>The learning curve aside, iPadOS 15 is a solid release, and it runs well on the new iPad. If you buy this tablet now, it should receive similar updates for years to come, which will go a long way toward keeping it fresh even though it was never a cutting-edge device.</p><h2></h2><h2>Wrap-up</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/320077e0-21ed-11ec-b3fe-c1e8b8a08ae2" alt="Apple iPad (2021) review photos" data-uuid="ea5a4de0-9dc3-32d0-8d1b-13f0bad09a4e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Coming from the iPad Pro, I was pleasantly surprised at how capable the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad" href="https://amzn.to/2Y3tCUM">iPad</a> is. I’ve gotten used to using the Magic Keyboard and its trackpad for work, so I found the new iPad’s $159 Smart Keyboard folio lacking. Between that and the smaller screen, it’s not my first choice for tasks that require me to keep an eye on multiple things simultaneously.</p><p>But it was a great device for drafting this review plus all the “iPad things” I want to do when I’m not working. I found myself using the iPad handheld, with its keyboard tucked away, more often than I expected. Being able to quickly flip back the keyboard t and use the iPad with two hands and then switch to typing when I wanted to bang out an email or reply to a message became a pretty common couch workflow.</p><p>Overall, I could do just about everything I can with my iPad Pro on the new iPad. There are a few slight changes and compromises here — but for the consumers Apple is targeting, those things might be moot. The iPad remains a very good tablet at a fair price. If you want something more modern, I don’t blame you, and would instead point you toward the iPad Air, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html">hits a sweet spot of performance, features and price.</a></p><p>If you’ve bought an iPad in the last two years, there’s no need to upgrade — but people with one older than the fall 2019 iPad will find some significant improvements here. If you’ve never bought one before, the new iPad delivers a surprisingly deep experience, despite its aging design.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-9th-generation-review-143045685.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb02f4a7-152d-49bc-9f00-03a54c5d2d36</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 14:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633014615</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T15:10:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/31ffdba1-21ed-11ec-bd7b-62669876f802" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/31ffdba1-21ed-11ec-bd7b-62669876f802" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad (2021) review photos]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad (2021) ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox Cloud Gaming goes live in Australia, Japan, Brazil and Mexico]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the same week it began public tests <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-console-cloud-gaming-test-insiders-190628810.html"><ins>of Xbox Cloud Gaming on consoles</ins></a>, Microsoft is expanding the project formerly known as xCloud in other ways.

Marvel’s <em>What If…?</em> is a show that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-doctor-strange-episode-four-173005535.html">plays around</a> but still mostly adheres to it, while <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/QObrBP"><em>Star Wars Visions</em></a> disregards it almost completely. Meanwhile, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> is a humorous show that wasn’t expected to follow canon and yet, the writers seem to have made it their mission to fill out the gaps in Star Trek continuity. And this might be the cartoon’s greatest strength.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/93475ba0-216a-11ec-b72b-849b10837b5b" data-uuid="5bf4db09-28a9-3257-ba96-b61505f2be0d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>The show’s willingness to reference past adventures is on full display this week, as the <em>USS Cerritos</em> is tasked with running drills to test crew efficiency. Seeing a Starfleet crew put through its paces is something we’ve seen many times before, though this time around it’s for a particularly non-Starfleet-like reason: Captain Freeman accidentally leaves our core four cast members behind when jetting off on a rescue mission. To be fair, the quartet of ensigns did forget to sign their magnet boots out, which would have let their senior officers know they weren’t on the ship. But still, it’s a screw-up we don’t often see on Star Trek.</p><p>In response, the entire crew is gathered in a cargo bay to be tested by a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Pandronian">Pandronian</a> instructor — a species never seen in any live-action Star Trek productions, but familiar to anyone who’s watched the 1973 animated series. Pandronians are colony creatures that can split into three pieces, something that was harder to create when special effects were far less sophisticated. Animation has fewer limitations, and <em>Lower Decks</em> has taken advantage of that plenty in its two seasons to showcase species like the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Caitian">Caitians</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ariolo">Ariolo</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Kzinti">Kzinti</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/afe8ead0-216a-11ec-bd6b-c19a6f10727f" data-uuid="987f9590-9bdc-3a5a-bb24-9b9992438cd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Though it utilized many of the cast and crew of the original series, the canonized status of the animated Star Trek was always a nebulous thing, with some writers saying that episodes like “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Yesteryear_(episode)">Yesteryear</a>” were in continuity, but no real on-screen confirmation of the show’s place in the timeline. One of show creator Mike McMahan’s stipulations for <em>Lower Decks</em> was that it take place in-canon, and he’s used that status to cement the 1973 cartoon in as well.</p><p>However, <em>Lower Decks</em> also has plenty to offer live-action fans, and this week’s episode is heavy on the references, with the Cerritos crew taking on simulations with names like “Natural Selection,” “Chain of Command&#39;&#39; and “Naked Time.” These aren’t just generic descriptions but also the names of episodes, and long-time fans will delight in seeing Mariner take on the Mirror Universe or Boimler face off against the Borg. We might be familiar with the scenarios, but seeing how these particular characters handle them adds a new twist.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ca710fe0-216a-11ec-a5f7-5a0878ef41af" data-uuid="d77d9fba-823c-3560-b808-e31cb7e4f19a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>While the whole drill plot might seem like a cheap way to pander to old-school fans, it’s also similar to how the military works in real life, with students often asked to study historical tactics and run tests based on real events. We’ve seen the holosuites used to recreate battles at the Alamo, Thermopylae and the Battle of Britain on <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, while Riker even used the holodeck to observe the <em>Enterprise NX-01</em>’s final mission. (And let’s not forget the time Troi had to kill Geordi to earn a promotion to commander.) From the beginning, <em>Lower Decks</em> has been a show that embraces Starfleet’s naval trappings more fully than we’ve ever seen, and putting the crew to the test here seems to be the logical endpoint of that.</p><p>But where <em>Lower Decks</em> shines brightest of all is when it chooses to glue the disparate parts of the Star Trek franchise together. The Star Trek universe is extremely weird and complex but, instead of rebooting the entire franchise (DC Comics) or throwing out huge swathes of past story (Star Wars), Star Trek has embraced the mess. The universe is weird, so it’s okay if everything doesn’t neatly fit together. It’s just funnier this way.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-eight-132048849.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7382818-d579-4ac1-ab07-190b5d126afa</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:20:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633007229</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T13:07:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cb266810-2168-11ec-a737-7d56b48e91bb" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cb266810-2168-11ec-a737-7d56b48e91bb" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["I, Excretus" Epi#208 -- Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

Nreal released its first model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-mixed-reality-glasses-vr-cover-consumer-market-021228380.html">Light</a> mixed reality glasses, to consumers a year ago after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-court-rejects-magic-leap-claims-nreal-founder-stole-mixedreality-secrets-120537120.html">fending off</a> Magic Leap&#39;s accusation that its founder stole trade secrets to build his own company. Air still needs to be tethered to a phone like the Light, but it it&#39;s a lot lighter (77 grams to Light&#39;s 106 grams) and looks more like an ordinary pair of sunglasses than its predecessor does. Nreal says it also has a better display, which has the capability to project a massive virtual screen up to 201 inches in size.</p><p>The device&#39;s display has a 46-degree Field of View and is powered by a micro-OLED chip for AR devices. It has a high density of colors, with up to 49 Pixels Per Degree, and a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. In comparison, the Light has a 52-degree FOV and a 60Hz refresh rate. One significant feature the Light has and the Air doesn&#39;t is inside-out tracking. The new model has no motion tracking at all, and a company spokesperson told us that based on Light&#39;s usage, Nreal expects most owners to use the Air simply to watch shows on Youtube. They said:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;People we know will use Nreal Air (a large number of them) for simply watching shows on YouTube, streaming content on local streaming platforms (like Magenta by Deutsche Telekom) based on Nreal Light&#39;s usage, which is why the tradeoff makes sense. The other bulk of users are using it for actual development. With that said, one of the biggest demands we saw was for using Nreal Light for a longer period of time (meaning lighter weight), and a more brilliant display. Those two would be the key features that were of paramount importance and the basis for how Nreal decided to strike a balance.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>A feature the Light doesn&#39;t have, however, is Air&#39;s &quot;Adjustable 3-Step Rake System&quot; that allows users to adjust the viewing angle by tilting the lens and the elastic temples. In addition, the Nreal Air can pair with Apple&#39;s iPhones and iPads and not just with Android devices. That could increase the possibility of users finding others with the model, so they could take advantage of its new shared digital space that allows multiple people to watch shows at the same time on a single AR screen.&nbsp;</p><p>Nreal Air will initially be available in Japan, China and South Korea in December 2021 in partnership with leading carriers. It will roll out to other markets in 2022, though the company didn&#39;t specify the additional regions where the device will be available. The firm recently <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/23/chinese-ar-glasses-firm-nreal-raises-100-million-in-new-funding.html">raised</a> $100 million to fund its international expansion, though, so the new model will likely be easier to purchase than the Light, which is only shipping in a handful of countries. Those interested will have to wait for the company to reveal how much the device will cost, though it did say that the Air will &quot;retail at a fraction of the price of Nreal Light.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e936a200-21e2-11ec-bb77-a90b4e5bfd2c" alt="Nreal" data-uuid="854ff94f-128c-31ff-bba1-1f0858e1421e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nreal</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nreal-air-augmented-reality-glasses-130059945.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">658ffcab-9e51-47e9-9da8-a1c72e7ec942</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633008257</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T13:24:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8bdd16c0-21f1-11ec-8edf-c80ad4356abb" width="1418" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/53324d50-21dc-11ec-afef-d4b4841fd9da" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nreal]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nreal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nreal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify brings polls and Q&A to all Anchor-hosted podcasts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify&#39;s quest to make podcasts more interactive is expanding.

It has the same exact speaker components as the original, a device <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html">we already loved</a>. The main difference is that the new Beam <em>also </em>has more processing power to handle Dolby Atmos surround sound. I tend to want more in a sequel, especially since in this case <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Gen 2 costs $50 more" href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8">Gen 2 costs $50 more</a> at $450. But even though it&#39;s more of a revision, the new Beam still manages to deliver a wider, more immersive soundscape than before. It proves that having a dollop of Dolby Atmos can go a long way.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="a0d39173-0019-4225-b31a-28b62593e1a1"/><p>The original Sonos Beam was a predictable hit. Consumers were hungry for soundbars to beef up their flatscreen TVs, and it turned out that many people also wanted a cheaper alternative to Sonos&#39;s two TV solutions at the time , the aging Playbar and the awkwardly shaped PlayBase, both priced at $699. Enter the $400 Beam: it was compact enough to fit in small living rooms; featured Amazon Alexa built in; and, most importantly, it sounded great. It was an accessible entry point into Sonos&#39;s family of connected speakers, pluss an easy upgrade for existing customers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Beam looks almost the same as before; the only difference is that it has a perforated plastic grille around its curved exterior, a departure from the thin cloth covering on the previous-gen model. It&#39;s still surprisingly small, measuring just 25.6 inches wide and weighing a mere six pounds. It has the same rear ports, too: Ethernet, HDMI and power. You&#39;ll need to plug it into an HDMI ARC/eARC socket on your TV to tap into the power of Dolby Atmos and TrueHD. (But if you&#39;ve got an older set, you can get basic Dolby Digital decoding with the bundled HDMI to optical adapter.)</p><p>Speaking of Atmos, that was a major deficiency on the earlier Beam. When that speaker was released in 2018,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-vizio-dolby-atmos-home-theater-systems.html"> soundbar makers like Vizio</a> were already exploring what was possible with Dolby&#39;s new technology. Typically, that involved using upward-firing speakers to bounce sound off of your ceiling. And, despite seeming like a bit of an audio hack, in my experience those speakers do a decent job of replicating what you get from Atmos-equipped cinemas, which have dedicated hardware built into their ceilings. There are limits, though: Upward-firing Atmos speakers tend to max out with 15-foot ceilings, and they work best with flat surfaces.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89957f10-21a1-11ec-badd-027b81af7e11" alt="Sonos Beam (Gen 2)" data-uuid="34a2fef9-56ff-3663-84b4-5e3e03cffb20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Given the additional hardware and room requirements, why go through the trouble of getting Atmos hardware at all? Simply put, it makes for more room-filling surround sound than traditional 5.1 solutions like Dolby Digital and DTS. Those earlier technologies sent sound to specific channels — left, right, center, two rears and a subwoofer. Atmos is different: It&#39;s object based, allowing engineers to map sounds in 3D (XYZ) space coordinates. That lets an Atmos mix automatically scale up anywhere from two speakers (or basic stereo support) to 64 in cinemas.</p><p>Sonos is no stranger to Atmos soundbars: It&#39;s the defining feature on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">$899 Arc</a>. But what makes the second-generation Beam unique is that it doesn&#39;t even have upward-firing speakers. It has the same basic hardware as before: a center tweeter, four mid-woofers for mid-range sound, and three passive radiators to handle the low-end. Instead, it&#39;s relying entirely on audio processing to simulate the Dolby Atmos experience. The additional CPU speed allows it to power two additional channels: height and surround for both the left and right speakers.</p><p>When Sonos first announced the second-gen Beam, I immediately wondered how the heck it could provide <em>any</em> height channels without adding more speakers. It turns out, the company leaned even more heavily into psychoacoustics, or the science of how we perceive sound. According to Scott Fink, the product manager behind all of Sonos&#39;s home theater gear, the company can tweak the audio timing and frequency to make it seem as if sound is coming from the side, or slightly above you. It&#39;s no replacement for having actual speakers dedicated to blasting height channels, but it worked surprisingly well in my testing.</p><section data-eng-breakout="134679b7670844008ecf242cfe28b41a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89961b50-21a1-11ec-befd-65aeb90f35ae" alt="Sonos Beam (Gen 2)"></section><p>During the opening chase in <em>Baby Driver</em>, for example, I could hear cars whizzing by my ears, the roar of powerful engines and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion&#39;s &quot;Bellbottoms&quot; filling my family room. That same scene on the original Beam sounded fine, but there was no sense of enveloping surround sound. The second-generation model just sounded like a richer experience, as if cotton balls were removed from my ears.</p><p>The same was true while revisiting 2015&#39;s (seriously underrated) <em>The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</em>, or the epic car-turned-motorcycle chase in <em>MIssion Impossible: Rogue Nation</em>. The new Beam is a tiny speaker meant to make a meal of bombastic action sequences, and it does so without distorting or breaking a sweat. Sonos also focused on making dialog clearer too, something I appreciated when conversations were happening amid those huge set pieces.</p><p>Mostly, though, I was impressed by what Sonos was able to do with such a small device. You can find soundbars and wireless surround sound systems for less than $450, and many will deliver bigger sound. But Sonos offers things other systems don&#39;t. For one, it&#39;s easy to set up: You just plug it into the appropriate ports and step through the process on Sonos&#39;s app. With competing products, you may also have to find spots to hold rear speakers, which still need to plug into power. As great as the new Beam sounds, though, it&#39;s no match for the Atmos capabilities of the Arc. But for half the price, I wouldn&#39;t expect it to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8995cd32-21a1-11ec-b7ff-982ef2140daf" alt="Sonos Beam (Gen 2)" data-uuid="65655810-2195-39ad-a24c-ba7898a32f4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to synchronized audio throughout your home, Sonos is still the connected speaker company to beat. There&#39;s no easier way to program music for house parties (and outdoor shindigs with the portable Roam and Move speakers). The second-gen Beam is a solid addition to the family when it comes to music, though it&#39;s less of an immediate upgrade compared to movies. It&#39;ll support Dolby Atmos on Amazon Music later this year, but that service currently doesn&#39;t have a huge number of Atmos tracks. Sonos isn&#39;t saying when it&#39;ll support Atmos on Apple Music, but there&#39;s technically nothing stopping that from happening down the line.</p><p>The new Beam sounded fine while playing back some of my favorite albums, like Bjork&#39;s <em>Homogenic</em> and Janelle Monae&#39;s <em>The Electric Lady</em>, with a decent sense of presence and some thumping low-end. But it didn&#39;t sound dramatically different like it did with action movies. Amazon Music&#39;s Ultra HD mix of Marvin Gayes&#39; &quot;What&#39;s Going On&quot; sounded very crisp and clear, but I&#39;ll be more interested in hearing what the Atmos version of that song sounds like eventually. On my Echo Studio, that Atmos mix almost sounds like Gaye is performing a live concert right in front of you.</p><p>And speaking of Echo devices, the Beam’s Alexa integration still works well. Its far-field microphones can hear me from the other side of my large family room, and it supports all of the same commands as Amazon’s own devices. It could easily replace an Echo in the same room, but you can also just mute the microphone and keep your Amazon account unlinked if you don’t want to have it listening in.</p><p>The Sonos Beam excels at being a simple and compact soundbar that&#39;ll give you a large soundstage for movies. But I&#39;d recommend sitting back and thinking about what&#39;s really important to you. Do you care more about having a clean TV setup without many wires? Or do you want a soundbar system with more realistic surround sound? (Actual rears, a subwoofer and upward-firing Atmos speakers.) If so, you&#39;ve also got great options like<a href="https://www.amazon.com/VIZIO-5-1-2-Theater-Sound-Dolby/dp/B08TV6GJF7"> Vizio&#39;s M-series 5.1.2</a> for around $500.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8995a621-21a1-11ec-afab-b5aaceff7af4" alt="Sonos Beam (Gen 2)" data-uuid="7764e60e-4296-352d-902c-09d2a48be917"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>You could eventually build a Sonos surround sound system around the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Beam" href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8">Beam</a> by adding two One speakers as rears, as well as the company&#39;s wireless subwoofer. But those two pieces of hardware alone would run you another $1,150 (or you could buy them <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:all bundled together for $1,499" href="https://fave.co/3zYnMkZ">all bundled together for $1,499</a>). If you&#39;re going that route, you might as well jump straight to the $899 Arc to have the best possible Sonos system.</p><p>The second-generation Sonos Beam isn’t a huge leap ahead of the original, but it’s still a better soundbar overall thanks to the addition of Atmos. If you already own a Beam, you don’t need to run out and grab one. But it’s a solid sub-$500 soundbar if you want to take your movie watching up a notch.</p><p><em>Note: Sonos is a former sponsor of my movie podcast, The Filmcast, but that hasn&#39;t stopped me from</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-30-sonos-smart-device-die.html"><em> being critical of the company</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99c71e63-3b69-48aa-9b68-12b43fcc63b5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633007990</ingested><modified>2021-09-30T13:20:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89941f80-21a1-11ec-b16f-f0c9f30ee644" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89941f80-21a1-11ec-b16f-f0c9f30ee644" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sonos Beam (Gen 2)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Beam (Gen 2)]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
