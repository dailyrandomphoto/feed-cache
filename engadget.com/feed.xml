In a blog post spotted by <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/117751/opensea-confirms-executive-used-insider-knowledge-when-buying-nfts"><em><ins>The Block</ins></em></a>, OpenSea <a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"><ins>admitted</ins></a> on Wednesday that one of its employees, Nate Chastain, had purchased NFTs he knew the company had planned to feature predominantly on its platform.</p><div id="6a8e16515026498bbcfdf275fd3239ef"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/opensea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@opensea</a> why does it appear <a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@natechastain</a> has a few secret wallets that appears to buy your front page drops before they are listed, then sells them shortly after the front-page-hype spike for profits, and then tumbles them back to his main wallet with his punk on it?</p>— Zuwu🟩 👻🎃🦇 (@ZuwuTV) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The admission came after a Twitter user named Zuwu <a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584?s=20"><ins>accused Chastain</ins></a> this week of using secret Ethereum wallets to buy front-page NFT drops before they were available for the public to purchase, and then later selling them at a profit following the inevitable spike in interest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OpenSea called the incident “incredibly disappointing,” and said it’s investigating what happened. “We want to be clear that this behavior does not represent our values as a team,” the company stated. “We are taking this very seriously and are conducting an immediate and thorough review of this incident so that we have a full understanding of the facts and additional steps we need to take.”</p><div id="2869e2642ccd45818ecb35344bd58107"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just wanted to secure one of these before they all disappeared tbh</p>— Nate Chastain (natec.eth) (@natechastain) <a href="https://twitter.com/natechastain/status/1422368341717573633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The company notes it has already implemented two new policies to prevent incidents like this from happening in the future. Moving forward, OpenSea employees aren’t allowed to buy or sell from collections and creators while they’re being promoted. They’re also prohibited from using confidential information to buy and sell NFTs on OpenSea and elsewhere.</p><p>Understandably, the incident has caused quite a stir among the company&#39;s customers, with some <a href="https://twitter.com/ghosthasie/status/1437932973714812936?s=20"><ins>likening Chastain’s behavior to insider trading</ins></a>. More than anything, the episode highlights just how much of a wild west the NFT market is at the moment. According to an <a href="https://mcmillan.ca/insights/nfts-and-implications-under-canadian-securities-law/">analysis</a> by business law firm McMillan, there are currently no laws in either the US or Canada that regulate the sales of NFTs. This incident may push the Securities and Exchange Commission to change that.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nate-chastain-nft-buying-incident-163044364.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b1ef26fc-ca47-48bc-8fcf-38adaf9f3ac9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631723081</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T16:24:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a1939570-163e-11ec-bdfa-50277a3ce501" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a1939570-163e-11ec-bdfa-50277a3ce501" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OpenSea]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OpenSea]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Boston Dynamics' Spot robot has learned to replan its routes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Boston Dynamics&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boston-dynamics-spot-enterprise-self-charging-spot-arm-153956229.html">Spot dog</a> is learning some new behaviors that will help the robot adapt to the real world. The company has <a href="https://blog.bostondynamics.com/spot-release-3.0-flexible-autonomy-and-repeatable-data-capture">delivered</a> a Release 3.0 update that helps Spot do its jobs without human intervention. Most notably, it can dynamically replan routes — the robot&#39;s inspection will go smoothly even if someone inadvertently left a forklift in the way.</p><p>The upgraded Spot can also handle human-free scheduled missions, and it&#39;s smart enough to automatically plan routes when you choose the actions you want to perform. The robot will help you notice when something&#39;s amiss, too. It uses scene recognition to capture photos at the same angle every time, and human inspectors can conduct live reviews of changes Spot notices with computer vision, such as gauge readings and heat changes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These updates won&#39;t mean much if you don&#39;t have the $74,500-plus to spend on a Spot of your own.

The cord-cutter service has added three Spanish-language channels from Univision at &quot;no extra cost,&quot; including Univision proper as well as the youth-oriented UniMás network and the general entertainment of Galavisión. All three are included at &quot;no extra cost,&quot; so you shouldn&#39;t have to brace for another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-price-increase-more-channels-175322450.html">rate hike</a>.</p><p>You&#39;ll have more options in the near future. YouTube TV is promising on-demand movies and originals from Pantaya as a $6 per month add-on in the weeks ahead. If you&#39;re more interested in variety, an upcoming add-on bundle will provide channels like Cinelatino, CNN Español, Discovery en Español, Estrella TV, Fox Deportes and Sony Cine for an added fee. The launch date and price are due in the &quot;coming months.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expansion represents a logical move. YouTube TV has some fierce competition, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sling-tv-2021-price-increase-232116955.html">Sling TV</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-live-tv-viacomcbs-showtime-cbs-mtv-comedy-central-152258748.html">Hulu Plus Live TV</a>. This could help YouTube keep up with and claim an edge over rivals by courting Latinx viewers that don&#39;t always get a healthy selection from streaming TV services. It&#39;s just as well — at $65 per month, YouTube&#39;s offering is expensive enough that it has to rely more on selection than raw value to attract subscribers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-spanish-channels-univision-145814394.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e7e0d62-9988-4c28-ba68-6bedb4632ea0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 14:58:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631717897</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T14:58:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e451f360-1630-11ec-bbdf-45054502345b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e451f360-1630-11ec-bbdf-45054502345b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube TV Spanish channels Galavision, Univision and UniMas]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube TV Spanish channels Galavision, Univision and UniMas]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TP-Link's latest WiFi 6 router includes a dedicated band for gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TP-Link knows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nitehawk-pro-gaming-xr1000-123031339.html">WiFi gaming routers</a> are as hot as ever, and it&#39;s determined to keep up by offering a string of high-end features without going completely over the top. The company has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210915005142/en/TP-Link-Reveals-Flagship-Archer-AX6600-Tri-Band-Wi-Fi-6-Gaming-Router-for-just-249.99/">unveiled</a> an <a href="https://www.tp-link.com/en/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-gx90/v1/">Archer GX90</a> router that offers not just WiFi 6 speeds (virtually required at this stage), but a dedicated 4.8Gbps &quot;Game Band&quot; to keep your play sessions free of interference from other local network transfers. An accelerator also spots and fine-tunes streams for games it recognizes, such as the Call of Duty series or <em>League of Legends</em>, while a dashboard provides stats on your playtime to help pinpoint problems.</p><p>You can expect some of the other familiar tricks to improve gaming performance. Improved OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) modulation is meant to reduce lag, and a 1.5GHz quad-core processor (TP-Link doesn&#39;t name it) helps juggle heavy traffic. This also happens to be a solid router for general use with a 2.5Gbps Ethernet jack (plus four 1Gbps jacks), two USB ports and support for mesh networking through TP-Link&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-tp-link-wifi-6-routers-ces-2019.html">OneMesh-capable</a> devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Archer GX90 will be available through Amazon (not as of this writing) and other outlets for $250. It&#39;s definitely more expensive than a typical home WiFi router, but that&#39;s decidedly less expensive than some tri-band WiFi 6 routers. So long as you don&#39;t mind the alien looks, this might strike a healthy balance between raw speed and a reasonable price.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-archer-gx90-wifi-6-gaming-router-141417158.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e32a1335-fb68-4293-839a-bb2d3fea6cde</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 14:14:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631714424</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T14:00:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/64bcf210-1628-11ec-bf24-be1ec9925545" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/64bcf210-1628-11ec-bf24-be1ec9925545" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TP-Link]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TP-Link Archer GX90 WiFi 6 gaming router]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TP-Link Archer GX90 WiFi 6 gaming router]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marshall unveils its first true wireless earbuds with ANC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Less than a year after introducing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marshall-true-wireless-earbuds-mode-ii-150019635.html">Mode II</a>, its first pair of true wireless earbuds, Marshall is expanding its lineup of Bluetooth headphones to include two new true wireless models: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Motif ANC" href="https://fave.co/3kcQCcP">Motif ANC</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Minor III" href="https://fave.co/3nClTIa">Minor III</a>.

There are three presets: Standard, Bass Boost and Shooter. The latter puts more emphasis on shots being fired and footsteps. You can craft your own presets and save up to three for easy access. You&#39;ll be able to change the equalizer settings through the Control Center, so you don&#39;t need to access the console&#39;s main menu system to switch things up.</p><p>Meanwhile, the latest PS5 system software adds support for 3D audio through built-in TV speakers. So, if you prefer to play without headphones and don&#39;t have a surround sound audio system, you may still get some of the effects of spatial audio.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-puls3-3d-headset-ps5-midnight-black-134526209.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40783512-ba10-4688-b721-1517af3618a6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:45:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631713528</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T13:45:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f02ac30-1629-11ec-9cf9-cd730851e505" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f02ac30-1629-11ec-9cf9-cd730851e505" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Pulse 3D headset in Midnight Black]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Pulse 3D headset in Midnight Black]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fitbit smartwatches now detect snoring and other loud noises]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your Fitbit smartwatch might just let you know if you or your partner is snoring too loudly. <em>9to5Google</em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/14/fitbit-snore-noise-detect/">notes</a> Fitbit is rolling out a promised &quot;Snore &amp; Noise Detect&quot; feature that uses the microphone on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">Sense</a> or Versa 3 smartwatch to detect both &quot;snore-specific&quot; sounds as well as the overall noise level.

The marquee device is the Xiaomi 11T Pro, the first smartphone to use the company&#39;s proprietary 120W <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-fully-charge-phone-eight-minutes-124528179.html">HyperCharge technology</a>. That lets you charge the 11T Pro&#39;s 5,000 mAh battery in just 17 minutes with 34 safety features including real-time temperature monitoring. It also uses technologies like dual charge pumps, a dual-cell battery structure and graphene tech.</p><p>That&#39;s just the start of the impressive laundry list of features, though. It comes with a triple-camera setup including a 108-megapixel wide angle, 2x tele-macro and 120 degree ultra-wide angle lens. Around the front, there&#39;s a 16-megapixel, f/2.45 in-display (pinhole) selfie camera. For video, it can record 8K using Samsung&#39;s HDR10+ system with AI cinema modes that allow for one-click recording.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/534739a0-160f-11ec-bef7-463ca993f20f" style="height:1344;width:2000;" alt="Xiaomi&#39;s 11T Pro smartphone supports Dolby Vision video and charges in 17 minutes" data-uuid="5630b8e5-e19d-3c09-801d-76949fb836d0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The 6.67-inch, FHD+ (2,400 x 1,080) AMOLED flat display is a technological <em>tour de force</em>, with features like a 120Hz refresh rate, TrueColor, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, 1,000 nits of peak brightness and Corning&#39;s tough <a href="https://www.engadget.com/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-152221345.html">Gorilla Glass Victus</a>. Sound-wise, you get Dolby Atmos audio with dual Harman Kardon speakers. Watching movies at those settings might eat the battery pretty quickly, but again, you can fully recharge the thing in just 17 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Inside, there&#39;s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and max 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, along with 5G, Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 6 and dual SIM slots. It will launch soon in gray, white and blue, with prices in Europe starting at €649 and going up to €749 for the 12GB/256GB model — but don&#39;t expect to see it in the US.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0183deb0-1610-11ec-be7f-a5a050a28df4" style="height:1217;width:2000;" alt="Xiaomi&#39;s 11T Pro smartphone supports Dolby Vision video and charges in 17 minutes" data-uuid="26927119-b724-3a03-a51e-f374b2442e6c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Next up, the 11T model shares many of the 11T Pro&#39;s features, including the camera setup and 6.67-inch 120 Hz flat AMOLED display with HDR10+. However, it lacks Dolby Vision and a few other display features. The biggest difference is the processor: It uses a MediaTek Dimensity 1200-Ultra 6-nanometer chip rather than the 5-nanometer Snapdragon 888. It also &quot;only&quot; offers Xiaomi&#39;s 67W wired turbo charging, rather than the 120W HyperCharge system and is limited to 8GB of LPDDR5 RAM and 256GB of storage. The 11T will also come in gray, white and blue and start at €599 when it arrives in Europe from &quot;official Xiaomi channels.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The last device is the Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G NE, a smaller but still well-spec&#39;d phone. It achieves a relatively tiny size with a thickness of 6.81mm and weight of 158 grams, or 5.57 ounces. At the same time, it still comes with a 6.55-inch AMOLED display with 10-bit TrueColor and Dolby Vision support. You get a triple-camera 64-megapixel main camera, 8-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera and a 5-megapixel tele-macro camera. Inside, there&#39;s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform and 4,250mAh battery with 33W fast charging. The Xiaomi 11 Lite 5G comes with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and starts at €369.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xiaomis-11-t-pro-smartphone-can-record-dolby-vision-video-and-charge-in-17-minutes-130051058.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0281f858-8eca-4978-898b-02fd31b2cfc9</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631702792</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T10:46:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c4233e40-160e-11ec-bf77-d7c65a33238d" width="2000" height="1129" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c4233e40-160e-11ec-bf77-d7c65a33238d" width="2000" height="1129" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Xiaomi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xiaomi's 11T Pro smartphone supports Dolby Vision video and charges in 17 minutes]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xiaomi's 11T Pro smartphone supports Dolby Vision video and charges in 17 minutes]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xiaomi unveils Pad 5 productivity tablet and Mi Smart Band 6 with NFC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Xiaomi has also launched a new tablet, the Pad 5, and an NFC version of the Mi Smart Band 6 today, in addition to its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomis-11-t-pro-smartphone-can-record-dolby-vision-video-and-charge-in-17-minutes-130051058.html">Xiaomi 11 smartphones</a>. The Pad 5 was designed with productivity in mind, specifically as a tool meant for people working or studying from home. It comes with the company&#39;s Smart Pen, which can be used to take notes or to quickly take screenshots with its function keys. The tablet has an 8-megapixel front camera that supports 1080p video for meetings and classes. It also has built-in capability to scan documents for later use or for sharing using its 13-megapixel rear camera.</p><p>Since the manufacturer wants the tablet to double as an entertainment center, it equipped the device with an 11-inch WQHD+ display that has a 120Hz refresh rate and added support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. The Xiaomi Pad 5 is powered by a 7nm Qualcomm Snapdragon 860 processor announced earlier this year, which <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-860-launch/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a> previously described as a revised version of the Snapdragon 855 that powered most flagships in 2019. It&#39;ll be available in Gray and Pearl White and in two configurations: One with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and another with 6GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, with prices that begin at EUR349 (US$412) and EUR399 (US$472), respectively. Release dates vary per region, and those interested will have to check availability in their location.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Xiaomi has also launched a new version of the Mi Smart Band 6 that was originally introduced in March 2020. The new band still has the health-focused features of the old one, including an SpO2 function, but it now also comes with the ability to make contactless payments via NFC. Xiaomi says it teamed up with Mastercard to add the feature to the wearable, which now also comes with built-in access to Amazon&#39;s Alexa voice assistant.

You can get a free SmartTag when you buy the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://amzn.to/398nKvN">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2</a> from the online retailer, with the final cost being $150. That&#39;s $30 off the normal price of the bundle, so those looking to add a few new accessories to their setup can do so for a bit less.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/398nKvN" id="abd771ae7f584a4e84b8773b1a265e1a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Buds 2 + SmartTag bundle at Amazon - $150</a><p>Samsung only just came out with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Galaxy Buds 2</a> in August, and they act as the company&#39;s affordable option in its wireless earbud lineup. We gave them a score of 84 because they pack a lot of value for $150. They have good sound quality with active noise-cancellation and an adjustable ambient sound mode. Unsurprisingly, the ANC isn&#39;t as powerful here as it is on pricier earbuds, but that&#39;s to be expected. However, the Buds 2 will do a decent job blocking out environmental noise around you. They also support wireless charging with their included case, and you should get five hours of use with ANC turned on before they need more juice.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-smart-things-app-can-now-detect-if-someone-is-tracking-you-103551450.html">SmartTag</a>, it&#39;s Samsung&#39;s answer to Tile trackers and Apple&#39;s AirTags. You probably won&#39;t use it to keep track of the Galaxy Buds 2, as it&#39;s better suited as a keychain attachment or something you slip into your wallet or backpack. You can then monitor the location of your things from your smartphone and force the SmartTag to chime whenever you need to find a misplaced item.</p><p>It goes without saying that this bundle is best for Android users, particularly those with Samsung smartphones. SmartTags aren&#39;t compatible with iOS devices, and while you could use the Galaxy Buds 2 with an iPhone, you won&#39;t get all of the customizable features in the companion app that you get when using them with an Android device.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-throws-in-a-free-smarttag-when-you-buy-samsungs-galaxy-buds-2-123901145.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e388c5db-7640-496c-97f9-f63abe01b129</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 12:39:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631709544</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T12:39:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a2-faa6-11eb-beb7-56bc5471380c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a2-faa6-11eb-beb7-56bc5471380c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

It’s claiming hours more runtime, depending on the model, which will be a notable improvement, and it’s one of the (admittedly dry) improvements I am always begging to see in new iPhones.</p><p>The decision remains: Do I want the mini (now Apple has upgraded the battery) or all the camera marvels of the Pro Max?

Left unsaid, however, is that level 4 and higher autonomous driving is still a distant dream, even after many years of development.

Just look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-syntrx-review-synthi-aks-synthesizer-140015009.html">SYNTRX</a> — it&#39;s one of the most amazing and also impractical synths I&#39;ve ever played. And the company&#39;s latest, Pērkons, continues that tradition. It chassis actually appears to be very similar to the SYNTRX, a metal rectangle with slightly rounded edges at the top and bottom, and wooden cheeks on the side. Of course the interface is completely different, which isn&#39;t surprising since Pērkons isn&#39;t an homage to the Synthi AKS, but a drum machine.&nbsp;</p><p>The core of Pērkons is a hybrid of four digital sound sources with an analog multimode filter and overdrive. The goal is big, thunderous percussion (hence being named after a Baltic god of thunder) — if you&#39;re going in thinking about a simple kick, snare, hat combo, you might be disappointed. Unfortunately Erica Synths is being really cagey about the drum machine right now, so I don&#39;t have a ton of impressions to share. Though, the company says that it &quot;tears down the borders between drum machine, synthesizer and drone instrument.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What I can say though is that is has a rather interesting collection of features. There are only four voices / sequencer tracks, but each voice has extensive controls and can be saved as &quot;kits&quot; for easy recall later. You can also record automation to a pattern (there&#39;s room for 64 on the Pērkons but you can expand the storage with an SD card), or modulate parameters with the LFO.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eecad0a0-15d1-11ec-8f9f-fcd2782439c3" alt="Erica Synths P&#x000113;rkons" data-uuid="0f1e8765-81ed-3020-afaa-5aa2afcae49c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Erica Synths</div></figure><p>Patterns can be up to 64 steps, with chance and ratchet controls for each step and there are four separate shuffle algorithms to keep things interesting. Plus an analog delay for getting your dub on and an optical compressor for punch.</p><p>Pērkons is obviously meant for the serious musician, though, not the casual knob twiddler. The size and €1,650 / $1,999 price make that pretty clear. But it&#39;s even more obvious when you look around back. There are separate outputs for each of the four voices, plus send and returns for each voice, so you could (if you wanted) add a distortion pedal to your bass drum and some flanger to the hats and... ring modulation to the snare, why not?</p><p>There&#39;s no firm release date yet, but Erica Synths says Pērkons will be out by the end of the year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/perkons-is-erica-synths-thunderous-new-drum-machine-superbooth-090024240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d015d55-eb98-4760-8cc7-8f900b8fe868</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Sep 2021 09:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631710592</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T12:56:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eeca8280-15d1-11ec-b3ac-c937c627ecd4" width="2000" height="1130" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eeca8280-15d1-11ec-b3ac-c937c627ecd4" width="2000" height="1130" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Erica Synths]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Erica Synths Pērkons]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Erica Synths Pērkons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft issues patch for zero-day exploit that uses malicious Office files]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has just <a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2021/09/14/cve-2021-40444-fix/">rolled out</a> an update <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability">fixing</a> 66 security vulnerabilities as part of this month&#39;s Patch Tuesday. One of them addresses a critical zero-day vulnerability that&#39;s being actively exploited by hackers using Office files containing malicious ActiveX controls. A few days ago, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-vulnerability-malicious-office-files-105010735.html">issued a warning</a> about the flaw after being notified by security researchers who discovered that bad actors are exploiting it by tricking potential victims into opening malicious Office files.

Both programs can detect attempts to exploit the vulnerability. It also advised users to disable all ActiveX controls on Internet Explorer.  The vulnerability known as CVE-2021-40444 affects Windows Servers from version 2008 and Windows 7 through 10. Security researchers proved that the exploit is 100 percent reliable, and all it would take to infect a computer is to open the file a hacker sends. Now, the new update will make sure the flaw can&#39;t be exploited anymore.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to patching CVE-2021-40444, the update also fixes two other critical flaws.

The state has <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-york-gas-vehicle-sales-ban-2035/">passed</a> a new law that bans the sale of gas vehicles starting in 2035, requiring all new cars to be zero emission. New York&#39;s Senate and Assembly passed the bill and Governor Kathy Hochul signed it into law last week. The move will help reduce the state&#39;s greenhouse gas emissions by 35 percent and help it achieve its <a href="https://climate.ny.gov/">climate targets</a>, including an 85 reduction in GHG emissions by 2050.</p><p>As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/landmark-new-york-law-passed-banning-new-fossil-fuel-vehicle-sales-from-2035/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, though, the state has a lot of work ahead of it, considering only around one percent of new vehicles sold in New York at the moment is fully electric. That&#39;s why, under the new law, several state agencies are required to work together to conjure a zero-emissions vehicle market development strategy by the end of next year. They&#39;ll have to find a feasible way to make sure that even off-road vehicles and equipment sold in the state are emissions-free by 2035. The law also requires all medium- and heavy-duty vehicles sold in New York to be emissions-free by 2045.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to having to convince people to buy electric within the next 14 years, New York will also have install an extensive charging network across the state.

Some carriers aren&#39;t fond of eSIMs and might limit your ability to switch carriers. Others might not support eSIMs or even disable them in versions sold by the network. In the right circumstances, though, it could be ideal for international travel, business lines or prepaid service. You might never need to visit a carrier store or wait for a SIM in the mail.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-pro-dual-esim-support-210232686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">633b4480-4364-4df7-8ed0-ffb2ea882bac</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 21:02:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631653355</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T21:02:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7561960-1599-11ec-83e4-5f41f96e5d89" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7561960-1599-11ec-83e4-5f41f96e5d89" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro color options]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro color options]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here’s everything Apple announced at its iPhone 13 event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="b7d22de0375745588aa0d76d2737351a"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YcFyafNFNjs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Apple kicked off its fall hardware release slate with “California Streaming,” an event dedicated to its newest iPhone and Apple Watch models. And while those devices obviously headlined the event, the company also announced a new iPad and iPad mini. Here’s everything the company showed off on Tuesday.</p><h2></h2><h2><strong>iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/22cec560-1586-11ec-bf4a-9fa5ff6216b9" style="height:1200;width:2000;" alt="Apple iPhone 13 Pro" data-uuid="3dbc0a79-711a-3d3a-8c1e-5d93cecadb08"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html"><ins>iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</ins></a> include a host of improvements aimed at content creators, including a more capable camera system and a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-cinematic-mode-rack-focus-181710157.html"><ins>Cinematic mode</ins></a> that can blur the background of your videos while keeping the subject in focus. However, the enhancement that’s most likely to get current iPhone owners to upgrade is the addition of Apple’s ProMotion display technology. The feature allows the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max to adjust the refresh rates of their displays up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling. The Pro lineup starts at $999, with pre-orders scheduled to open on September 17th and general availability to follow on September 24th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/58093a80-158b-11ec-bf78-96d540e8cd14" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="iPhone 13 mini" data-uuid="3b48e195-b164-3652-8c00-2ae92ee476f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple’s more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-174459983.html"><ins>affordable pair of iPhones</ins></a> didn’t get as many upgrades as their Pro siblings, but the ones they did receive are still notable. Internally, the devices feature the company’s new A15 Bionic chips and bigger batteries. Apple also redesigned its TrueDepth camera array to make it smaller, leading to a less prominent but still noticeable notch on both devices. The iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini will start at $799 and $699 when they go up for pre-order on Friday and then go on sale on September 24th.</p><h2><strong>Apple Watch 7</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a49aeed0-158a-11ec-b53f-96cfcec3a3a7" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Apple Watch Series 7 in steel" data-uuid="502b8219-ca2d-3f05-bc98-a8e6d9c737cf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The Apple Watch is about to get bigger yes, but perhaps the more important story with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-release-date-price-172920553.html"><ins>Series 7</ins></a> is that Apple has made the wearable more durable. The Series 7 is the first Apple Watch to include dust resistance. The screen is also more crack-resistant thanks to the refreshed design. When it arrives sometime this fall, the Series 7 will start at $399.</p><h2><strong>iPad mini</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bb59b0d0-157f-11ec-bf7d-29b4998fe117" style="height:1200;width:2000;" alt="Apple iPad mini 6th-gen" data-uuid="003714d4-c819-3d3d-970c-f9644a8e251e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>After two and a half years without a refresh, Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-mini-6th-gen-apple-event-home-button-171740845.html">iPad mini</a> got a substantial update on Tuesday. In short, the company took essentially everything that made the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html"><ins>4th-generation iPad Air</ins></a> so compelling and gave it to its smallest iPad. We’re talking about an updated design, USB-C connectivity, support for the company’s second-generation Apple Pencil and a brighter and more colorful display, among various other upgrades.

The most important of those is a new 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ultra-wide lens that comes with the iPad Pro’s Center Stage feature. The inclusion of Center Stage allows the camera to crop into the subject intelligently so that they’re always at the center of the frame. The 9th-generation iPad will start at $329 when it becomes available on September 24th.</p><h2><strong>Everything else</strong></h2><p>Outside of new hardware, Apple announced it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-will-be-available-to-download-on-september-20th-182701197.html"><ins>release iOS 15 on September 20th</ins></a>.

The approach typically favors businesses as arbitrations are often quicker than lawsuits, deny access to class actions and, most importantly, keep matters private.

mini]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple kicked off its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021">hardware event</a> today by revealing two updated iPads that improve upon existing models. The base, 10.2-inch iPad may look the same as the previous version, but it packs better performance and a more advanced camera. The new iPad mini, on the other hand, has been completely redesigned to look like a smaller iPad Pro. Here&#39;s how you can pre-order both the new 10.2-inch iPad and the new iPad mini.</p><h2>10.2-inch iPad</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fce1ae0-157f-11ec-bebd-f36a5a79a927" alt="Apple 10.2-inch iPad" data-uuid="2c6cf36e-9db1-3211-aa99-3a19989f03b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The updated <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:10.2-inch iPad" href="https://amzn.to/3Envjgs">10.2-inch iPad</a> is available to pre-order today from <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2">Apple</a> and Amazon starting at $329 and will be widely available on September 24.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Envjgs" id="3f73d569cedf44abba9b01a5a62047eb" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy iPad at Amazon starting at $329</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2" id="93bd38a7997c4a72b449f1be1cba3d33" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy iPad at Apple starting at $329</a><p>Similarly to last year, Apple focused on updating the internals of this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-a13-bionic-171718680.html">iPad</a> rather than its design. Inside is a A13 Bionic chipset with neural engine, which the company claims will provide 20 percent better performance than the previous tablet. The other major update is the new 12MP ultra wide, front-facing camera that supports Apple&#39;s Center Stage feature. This allows the camera to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in focus during video calls even as you move around. Apple debuted this feature on the latest iPad Pros and now even those opting for the most budget-friendly iPad can get that advanced feature.</p><p>The base iPad still has 10.2-inch Retina display but it now supports TrueTone, which will make it easier on the eyes. It still has a physical Home button on its bottom edge and it still supports the first-generation Apple Pencil for those that want to doodle and take notes with the tablet. Notably, the base configuration comes with double the storage than the previous model — 64GB instead of 32GB — which was a much-needed update.</p><h2>iPad mini</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70e5a0d0-158a-11ec-bfbb-2cb219e8ad36" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="b7f9dc47-3cae-39df-8507-86cc9596b314"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The updated <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad mini" href="https://amzn.to/3Cbdhw8">iPad mini</a> is available to pre-order today from <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini">Apple</a> and Amazon starting at $499 and will be widely available on September 24.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Cbdhw8" id="5d923af33f5b4d3fb8ded19f9150cf86" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy iPad mini at Amazon starting at $499</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini" id="4e6e42f62caf466e98db4c25f6e00172" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy iPad mini at Apple starting at $499</a><p>Apple needed to give the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-mini-6th-gen-apple-event-home-button-171740845.html">iPad mini</a> some love. The company&#39;s smallest tablet received a minor update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-ipad-mini-review-2019.html">two years ago</a>, and hadn&#39;t received a big update for three years before that. So the 2021 iPad mini represents the biggest change for the compact tablet in roughly five years, and Apple essentially made it look like a tiny version of its iPad Pros. It has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that extends almost edge-to-edge, and that means the physical Home button is gone. Apple move its TouchID technology to the top button on this tablet, which makes it similar to the iPad Air. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil and the accessory can magnetically attach to the mini&#39;s side, just as it does with the iPad Pros.</p><p>The new iPad mini also has the 12MP ultra wide, front-facing camera found on the base iPad, which means Center Stage calls will be available on this device, too. The rear camera is a new 12MP shooter with Focus Pixels, True Tone flash and the ability to take Smart HDR photos.</p><p>Inside the iPad mini is the A15 Bionic chip, which has a six-core CPU and a five-core GPU, and Apple promises 40 percent better performance out of this slab than the previous version. It also has the neural engine which makes for more efficient machine-learning experiences. It&#39;ll come in WiFi and WiFi + Cellular versions and it now supports WiFi 6 and 5G connectivity. Another small yet important change is in the iPad mini&#39;s charging method — gone is the old Lightning port, as it&#39;s been replaced with a USB-C port for faster, more efficient charging.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-new-apple-ipad-and-ipad-mini-2021-184818462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd73ecd0-5eb9-455d-9455-890f504803f1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631707175</ingested><modified>2021-09-15T11:59:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a541dd30-158a-11ec-b3bf-fb9f74697eed" width="1960" height="1260" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a541dd30-158a-11ec-b3bf-fb9f74697eed" width="1960" height="1260" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 10.2-inch iPad 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 10.2-inch iPad 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 vs. the competition: Battle of the batteries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By this time most kids have gone back to school and, here at Engadget, it’s time to get back to the phone grind.
