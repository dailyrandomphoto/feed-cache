It has scooped up warrants for at least a dozen publicly traded companies and more than 75 private businesses, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-demands-one-more-thing-from-some-vendors-a-piece-of-their-company-11624968099"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>. Amazon&#39;s stakes and potential stakes in those organizations is worth billions of dollars.</p><p>Warrants work in a similar way to stock options. Holders of warrants can buy shares at a fixed price during a certain period. If the share price rises during that time, the warrant holder can swoop in and buy a stake in the company at a below-market rate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon is <a href="https://twitter.com/DanaMattioli/status/1409849896950243334"><ins>said to have</ins></a> warrant deals with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-23-amazon-returns-at-kohls.html"><ins>Kohl&#39;s</ins></a>, aircraft-leasing companies, call center businesses and hydrogen fuel cell suppliers, among others. Some of the deals have made Amazon one of the top shareholders in the respective companies, according to the report. In several cases, the ecommerce giant has the right to board seats and an option to outbid any acquisition offers.</p><p>Leaders at some of the companies suggested they couldn&#39;t turn down Amazon&#39;s proposals, else they could risk losing a big contract to a competitor. Some chalked up Amazon&#39;s demands as the price of doing business.</p><p>Amazon told the <em>WSJ </em>that warrant agreements are part of less than one percent of the deals it agrees with suppliers. In some cases, the warrants are connected to certain thresholds. They often don&#39;t come into effect until Amazon purchases a certain level of goods or services.</p><p>We&#39;ve seen some other evidence of this strategy in action. Last week, Amazon <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-talks-buy-stake-ai-115612141.html"><ins>ordered</ins></a> 1,000 autonomous driving systems from Plus, a company that develops such tech for self-driving trucks. It also has the option to buy up to a 20 percent stake in the startup.</p><p>Amazon has reportedly been engaging in this practice over the last decade or so, and it&#39;s said to have ramped up its efforts to secure warrants over the past few years. However, with Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-five-antitrust-bills-apple-google-facebook-amazon-205114170.html"><ins>facing deepening antitrust scrutiny</ins></a>, regulators may not look favorably on a report that suggests Amazon is pressuring companies into accepting terms that could require them to sell stakes at below-market rates.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-supplier-stake-warrant-below-market-value-145545027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">390586dd-735a-4f32-9600-a38dcb33f9a3</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:55:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624978746</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T14:59:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5d134100-d8e7-11eb-8ffd-a1658ea76643" width="5315" height="3543" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5d134100-d8e7-11eb-8ffd-a1658ea76643" width="5315" height="3543" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ivan Romano via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NAPLES, ITALY - MARCH 22: A worker inside the Ariete 1 warehouse, during the first Amazon workers strike on March 22, 2021 in Arzano, Italy. The first strike of Amazon workers organized by the CGIL, Cisl and Uil unions at the Arzano headquarters was totally deserted by the workers who did not join the presidium to which, in addition to the unions, some formations of the extra-parliamentary left joined. The unions had called the strike day to ask for a review of many aspects of staff contracts: workloads, shifts, meal vouchers, bonuses, travel allowances and reduced working hours, and a general stabilization of drivers, the logistics sector and the administered employees. For some trade unionists, the absence of workers from the garrison should be read as "fear that their contracts will not be renewed".

It just rolled out a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-sphere-171103558.html">long-teased</a> Reading Sidekick feature that uses an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-dot-clock-2020-review-143052099.html">Echo</a> Kids device to help your kids read aloud on their own time. Children just have to tell Alexa &quot;let&#39;s read&quot; to take turns reading supported books, whether they&#39;re digital or physical. Your young ones won&#39;t always have to wait for you, in other words.</p><p>You&#39;ll need a Kids+ subscription to use the Sidekick, although you&#39;ll at least have your choice of books. Over 700 titles will be available for kids aged 6 to 9, and Amazon is promising &quot;hundreds more&quot; every month.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Appropriately, Amazon is simultaneously rolling out Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids. Set them up for your children (as many as four) and they&#39;ll get parental controls, kid-appropriate responses as well personalized Alexa skills, games and media. Not everyone will have Voice Profiles for Kids right away, but they should be available to everyone by July 2nd.</p><p>Before you ask: yes, Amazon is aware that parents and teachers should be involved in reading whenever possible. It&#39;s not suggesting that you use a smart speaker as a substitute for reading at bedtime. Reading Sidekick is meant to fill in the gaps and encourage kids to read aloud more often — you don&#39;t have to worry quite so much if a business trip keeps you away from home.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-reading-sidekick-140006613.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c50525e8-9a46-4891-b83c-5336dcdec5be</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624972638</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T13:17:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Parenting]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e5a4480-d8dc-11eb-a6ff-2492753b53b7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e5a4480-d8dc-11eb-a6ff-2492753b53b7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Alexa Reading Sidekick with Echo Dot speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Alexa Reading Sidekick with Echo Dot speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP's Pavilion Aero is its lightest consumer laptop yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP" href="https://fave.co/3dqqC9P">HP</a> has unveiled the Pavilion Aero 13, which is the company&#39;s lightest consumer laptop yet.

At the end of the clip, there&#39;s a snippet of the frenetic, industrial shooter gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Contra Returns</em> originally launched in China back in 2017.

No-go areas include stadiums and sporting events; airports; security sensitive locations such as military airbases, national landmarks and critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants; and even temporarily restricted sites that may be out of bounds because of an emergency (such as a wildfire). Having an app in your pocket that gives you that info in real-time is obviously an important resource.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With a green light from the FAA, Wing says you can also use OpenSky to quickly request authorization to fly in controlled airspace, including areas surrounding US airports.

Now, LG has <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/">announced</a> that it&#39;s rolling out a firmware update that unlocks Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on its latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:2021 C1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Jrq7Be">2021 C1</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:G1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjD7E6">G1</a> series OLED models.&nbsp;</p><p>We knew that LG&#39;s high-end G1 and mainstream C1 series should be capable of 120 Hz 4K gaming with Dolby Vision, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdqCY9PEmKk">HDTV Test&#39;s Vincent Teoh</a> pointed out recently. However, Xbox Series X owners have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/mxt38a/dolby_vision_gaming_at_4k_120hz/">reporting</a> that those models weren&#39;t working, with an error message that &quot;your TV setup doesn&#39;t support Dolby Vision at 4K 120 Hz.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG told Teoh at the time that it was testing the functionality and working to bring it to market, and now it has done so with the firmware version 03.15.27. That makes the C1 and G1 series OLED TV models &quot;the first in the world capable of supporting Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on compatible platforms,&quot; the company said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/36f71d10-d8ca-11eb-86df-e5acac4e3a20" alt="LG&#39;s latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming" data-uuid="88c530f2-247a-39d4-bb97-ecbaebe1e2e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>In addition, it&#39;s testing the feature on other 2021 models including the OLED Z1 series, QNED Mini LED QNED99 series and NanoCell NANO99 series, all slated to receive the update in July. &quot;Additional 2021 and 2020 TV models are also being tested for Dolby Vision gaming in either 60Hz or 120Hz,&quot; the company added. There&#39;s no word on whether its 2019 OLED models, some of which also support both 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision, will be updated.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if you have an Xbox Series X or S console and 2021 LG G1 or S1 series TV, you&#39;ll be able to make the error message go away. However, you still won&#39;t be able to play any 4K 120Hz Dolby Vision games, because none exist at the moment. When they do eventually arrive, you should see not only more fluid playback, but brighter images, improved contrast and more vibrant, saturated colors — much as you do on Dolby Vision-encoded films and TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with that feature, the new firmware also introduces the Game Dashboard (shown above), a floating menu that helps LG owners optimize settings. It works on any any 2021 LG TV with Game Optimizer, letting users switch between genres (standard, FPS, RPG or RTS). You&#39;ll also be able to see the status of modes like black stabilizer, low latency and variable refresh rate. The new update is now rolling out, so if you own a supported set, you should gain access to all of those features soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-tvs-120-hz-dolby-vision-gaming-114549499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23007136-5514-4a09-821a-d30da0093388</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969324</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:22:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon launches a vinyl of the month club]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How can Samsung make its smartwatches as successful as the Apple Watch?

With the new Wear OS inside, the One UI Watch will offer Google Play Store access, including apps from Adidas, Calm and MyFitnessPal, as well as core Google services, from Maps to Messages to YouTube Music. This will be crucial in helping Samsung turn a corner with its smartwatches. According to the latest figures from IDC, it remains a contender, but the Apple Watch still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-watch-and-air-pods-are-dominating-the-wearable-market-123044790.html https://www.engadget.com/...">dominates</a> the wrists of smartwatch buyers.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html">YouTube TV now supports 4K streaming, but it comes at a price</a></h2><h3>A new 4K Plus plan adds at least $10 to your YouTube TV subscription.</h3><p></p><p>Finally, starting today, YouTube TV will have a new add-on called 4K Plus.

The 4K Plus add-on costs $19.99 per month, on top of whatever your existing YouTube TV plan costs. (Right now, the basic YouTube TV plan starts at $64.99 a month.) That said, if you act quickly, you can get a price deal on 4K Plus — YouTube is offering a one-month free trial to new users, after which you can sign up for $9.99 per month, a pretty good deal over the standard price.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html"><strong> Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html">&#39;Dune&#39; release gets pushed back again</a></h2><h3>Warner Bros. plans to release it simultaneously on HBO Max and theaters.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0b043a11-d8c7-11eb-bbf7-41345ab912d9" style="height:404;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="56b600e0-e088-39a2-ba59-8833ec4968ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure></a><p>If you&#39;ve been waiting impatiently to see Denis Villeneuve&#39;s much-anticipated take on<em> Dune</em>, you&#39;ll have to keep on waiting.

We can’t wait to bring PlayStation fans more fresh, new experiences.”</p><p>The deal also makes sense based on Sony&#39;s long-standing collaborative relationship with Housemarque. Several of the studio&#39;s biggest games were PlayStation console exclusives, including <em>Resogun</em>, <em>Alienation</em>, <em>Nex Machina</em> and <em>Matterfall</em>. It will now be tasked with repeating that success under the PlayStation Studios banner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3bdefe4b-6e6a-4327-831c-28d93a55c929</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:41:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624964977</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T11:09:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's new support website will help you locate local US food banks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has launched a new website called <a href="https://findfoodsupport.withgoogle.com/">Find Food Support</a>, which puts important resources on how to locate free and affordable food in the US in one place. Perhaps the most useful feature the website can offer is a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-rolling-out-maps-improvements-to-the-benefit-of-drivers-and-pedestrians-alike-183243714.html">Google Maps</a> tool that can point you to the nearest food bank, food pantry or school lunch program pickup site.&nbsp;</p><p>As the tech giant explains, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated hunger for people around the world. According to <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/National%20Projections%20Brief_3.9.2021_0.pdf">Feeding America</a> (PDF), 45 million people in the US alone had no reliable access to affordable food last year, including children who lost access to school lunches. That&#39;s a 30 percent increase from 2019. The non-profit has a slightly better forecast for 2021, but it still believes 42 million people in the country — 13 million of which are children, and 1 in 5 of which are Black individuals — may experience food insecurity this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google worked with No Kid Hungry, FoodFinder and the US Department of Agriculture to add 90,000 places with free food support across 50 states on Maps. The company said it will add more locations in the future. To use the tool, you only have to go to the website, whether on a PC or on mobile, and type in your location. It will then show you the nearest food banks and pantries with their addresses, phone numbers, and the days and hours they&#39;re operational.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/83b06a80-d8b1-11eb-bbff-ddda03c058a4" style="height:942;width:733;" alt="Google" data-uuid="be40e211-db15-3f4f-b44f-c3070fda7281"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Find Food Support also houses YouTube videos showing how food insecurity affects people from all walks of life. The hope is to destigmatize food insecurity, since the stigma associated with getting help prevents people from seeking groups and organizations that can assist them in their time of need. In addition, the website contains links to food support hotlines, benefit guides per state and information for specific demographics and communities, such as seniors, families and children and military families. And in case you don&#39;t need food aid and want to help out, you can also find information on how you can donate food, time or money on the website.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-find-food-support-website-100012251.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74e55bef-4088-4b88-96f3-7a416cf57f35</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624957565</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T09:06:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nikon's Z FC mirrorless camera recalls the glory days of 35mm film]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nikon is taking a trip back to its glory days of 35mm film photography with its second Z-series APS-C (DX) mirrorless camera, <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/0629_mirrorless_01.htm">the Z FC</a>. Designed to evoke the company&#39;s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM2">FM2 SLR</a> from the &#39;80s, it offers generous manual controls, including dedicated dials for shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. The decidedly retro look might also appeal to folks looking at stylish models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-fujifilm-x-t30-review.html">Fujifilm</a> and others.</p><p>Unlike Fujifilm&#39;s models, however, the Z FC has a standalone mode dial, so you won&#39;t set modes by combining settings from the ISO, shutter or aperture dials. It has a d-pad type control at the back, but (like the Z50) lacks a dedicated joystick.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/25d82640-d8a8-11eb-bded-16faa5b5abf9" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="47e357d0-369a-3f79-bf76-9504adf3147c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>The Z FC (presumably the FC stands for film camera?) isn&#39;t just about the looks and handling, though. It uses Nikon&#39;s Z mount system and shares the 20.9-megapixel sensor, Expeed 6 processor and other features with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-nikon-z50-camera-review.html">Nikon&#39;s Z50</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it adds a fully-articulating OLED (rather than LCD) display, and a significantly faster USB-C socket for transfers, charging and director power. Other physical features include a 2.36 million-dot electronic viewfinder, single SD card slot, microphone port (no headphone port) and an EN-EL25 battery that delivers up to 300 shots on a charge.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/368d0910-d8a8-11eb-bcfe-0641aab8ed2e" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="d1010e81-9968-31ac-b8d0-218d4ecd0ead"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Like the Z50, it can shoot at 11 fps with autofocus and auto-exposure enabled, with object, face and eye-tracking. However, it now lets you combine face and eye-tracking with a wide focus mode, expanding where the camera looks for a subject.&nbsp;</p><p>You can shoot oversampled 4K video using the full sensor width, and the Z FC introduces full-time eye autofocus mode while shooting video. That, combined with the fully-articulating sensor, will make the Z FC much more useful for vlogging and shooting selfies than the Z50.&nbsp;</p><p>To best take advantage of the small size and retro looks, Nikon also introduced the Nikkor Z 28mm f/2.8 (SE). It&#39;s relatively small and has a good field of view for tourist or street photography, and also offers a pleasantly retro look.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z FC arrives in late July at $960 for the body only, $1,100 with the DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR kit lens or $1,200 with the new 28mm F.2.8 (SE) lens. The latter will also be sold separately for $300, but it won&#39;t arrive until the fall.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fd9f9a0-d8a8-11eb-a757-81896a2e75e8" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="17f1e74b-66ba-36a6-b200-df935c7828cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-fc-apsc-camera-retro-chic-071315225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d5d72b3-5c8e-41e2-810e-89126d0b4736</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:13:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969476</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Nikon Z FC camera seen from head on.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nikon Z FC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is reportedly using algorithms to fire Flex delivery drivers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s contract Flex delivery driver fleet already has to deal with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apologizes-for-tweets-attacking-work-conditions-192622311.html">various indignities</a>, and you can now add the fact that they can be hired — and fired — by algorithms, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-28/fired-by-bot-amazon-turns-to-machine-managers-and-workers-are-losing-out"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure same-day and other deliveries arrive on time, Amazon uses millions of subcontracted drivers for its Flex delivery program, started in 2015. Drivers sign up via a smartphone app via which they can choose shifts, coordinate deliveries and report problems. The reliance on technology doesn&#39;t end there, though, as they&#39;re also monitored for performance and fired by algorithms with little human intervention.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the system can often fire workers seemingly without good cause, according to the report. One worker said her rating (ranging from Fantastic, Great, Fair, or At Risk) fell after she was forced to halt deliveries due to a nail in her tire. She succeeded in boosting it to Great over the next several weeks, but her account was eventually terminated for violating Amazon&#39;s terms of service. She contested the firing, but the company wouldn&#39;t reinstate her.</p><blockquote><p>Whenever there’s an issue, there’s no support. It’s you against the machine, so you don’t even try.</p></blockquote><p>Another driver was unable to deliver packages to an apartment complex because it was closed with the gate locked, and the residents wouldn&#39;t answer their phones. In another building, an Amazon locker failed to open. His rating also dropped and he spent six weeks trying to raise it, only to be fired for falling below a prescribed level.</p><p>If a driver feels they&#39;re wrongly terminated, many feel there&#39;s not much recourse, either. Drivers must pay $200 to dispute any termination, and many have said it&#39;s not worth the effort. “Whenever there’s an issue, there’s no support,” said Cope, who is 29. “It’s you against the machine, so you don’t even try.”</p><p>Inside Amazon, however, the program has been chalked up as a success, a former engineer who worked on the program told Amazon. And that bears out in the numbers. Around 4 million drivers have downloaded the&nbsp;app worldwide including 2.9 million in the US, according to the report. More than 660,000 people in the US have downloaded the app in the last five months alone.</p><p>Amazon said drivers’ claims of poor treatment and unfair termination were anecdotal and don’t represent the experience of the vast majority of Flex drivers. “We have invested heavily in technology and resources to provide drivers visibility into their standing and eligibility to continue delivering, and investigate all driver appeals,” Spokesperson&nbsp;Kate Kudrna told <em>Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-algorithms-fire-flex-delivery-drivers-055959081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">487b9b68-38bc-42ae-8dc5-925cff33ed7a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 05:59:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624946410</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T06:00:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cb21860-d89e-11eb-bf5e-343ec43c4eca" width="4970" height="3437" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cb21860-d89e-11eb-bf5e-343ec43c4eca" width="4970" height="3437" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[picture alliance via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[28 April 2021, Brandenburg, Kiekebusch: The logo of Amazon, (Amazon.com, Inc., listed US online mail order company), at the shipping warehouse in Kiekebusch, a district of the municipality of Schönefeld in the district of Dahme-Spreewald.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the Japanese conglomerate has stopped the robot&#39;s production last year and is slashing jobs across robotics-related businesses in several countries.

Pepper was built as a social robot that can recognize faces and basic human emotions, so it can interact with people. Most of the units SoftBank produced are leased to corporate clients, and the company also placed the robot in its mobile phone stores in Japan.</p><p>With a price of over $1,600, though, Pepper a bit too expensive for most developers and small businesses. <em>Reuters</em>&#39; sources said its sales suffered from limited functionality and unreliability. Further, SoftBank wasn&#39;t able to give the robot more features, because culture clashes between its French business in charge of robotics projects and its Tokyo management reportedly affected Pepper&#39;s development.&nbsp;</p><p>After SoftBank shifted its focus to the cleaning robot Whiz, Pepper was sidelined. The company plans to cut about half of its 330 staff positions in France in September, <em>Reuters</em> said, and half of the sales staff positions in the US and Britain had already been cut.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/softbank-stopped-production-pepper-robots-032616568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">606f21aa-980f-4020-80de-f19d1e2ab266</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 03:26:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624937164</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T03:26:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tatiana Dyuvbanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prague, Czech republic - February 1, 2019: The Robot consultant with digital tablet in Prague airport in Czech republic.

As far as recent computer advances go, it&#39;s one of the more noticeable upgrades you can get since they help make every interaction, including scrolling, look and feel significantly smoother. But turning up the refresh rate on your laptop&#39;s display is also a major battery drain. You can get the best of both worlds by manually switching between different refresh rates, but that&#39;s time-consuming to do and so Microsoft is introducing a new feature called&nbsp;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic refresh rate</a>&nbsp;(DRR) with the first Windows 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-insider-preview-170004505.html">Insider preview</a></p><p>As the name suggests, DRR will lower your laptop&#39;s refresh rate to 60Hz when you&#39;re doing things like writing emails and documents and then increase it to 120Hz when inking and scrolling so that those interactions feel more instantaneous. As of today, support for the feature is mainly limited to a handful of apps from Microsoft and Adobe. For instance, your computer&#39;s refresh rate will increase to a faster refresh rate when you&#39;re inking and scrolling in Office. However, Microsoft says more apps will support the feature over time. One thing to note is DDR won&#39;t turn on while you&#39;re playing a game, so no need to worry about putting you at a disadvantage in a competitve multiplayer match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To try out DRR, you&#39;ll need a laptop that features a display with support for a variable refresh rate of at least 120Hz. You&#39;ll also need a graphics driver that supports the feature. As such, even if you have a laptop that meets the above requirements, you may not be able to enable DRR after installing the first Windows 11 Insider build. That&#39;s something Microsoft says it&#39;s working with manufacturers to address. But if your laptop has the necessary driver support, you&#39;ll find the option to turn on DRR in the Systems menu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-191145232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc44ecd2-b1aa-47b9-af52-64d6161ef461</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:11:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624907510</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T19:12:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senator proposes law to safeguard journalists’ data from the government]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, Sen.

One of the problems with prior attempts at this legislation had to do with how a journalist is defined plus what kind of activities should be protected. A federal law, for example, would have to figure out how to safeguard journalist’s privacy while also protecting national security interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyden’s bill proposes that journalists be shielded from court-ordered disclosures of sources, but allows for exceptions if the information would prevent terrorism, identify terrorists, or if it would prevent violence or death.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senator-proposes-federal-shield-law-183325202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd69b229-e20d-4895-80ea-f3c6dfd0b72b</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 18:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624970138</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:35:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6eb771a0-d83e-11eb-bfe7-51d157de54f0" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get up to 25 courses on how to code in different languages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to program isn’t a straightforward process, and it certainly can’t be mastered overnight.

A ghost named Mama is there to help the girl and narrate the story as it unfolds. As with past Nier titles, it looks like the gameplay in&nbsp;<em>Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>will sometimes shift between different perspectives. While developed by Applibot, a Japanese developer best known for mobile games like&nbsp;<em>Grimoire A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>features contributions from those most closely associated with the series, including Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe. You can hear one of the new songs Okabe composed for the game in the trailer <em>IGN</em> shared.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Reincarnation</em>&nbsp;will be free to download when it comes out on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.nierspww">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1506553488">iOS</a>. If you pre-register for the game, you&#39;ll get a welcome package that comes with its in-game Gems currency. Square Enix told <em>IGN</em> it would increase the number of Gems it gives out for every 100,000 players that pre-register.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nier-reincarnation-july-28-173420921.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd4a183b-e671-4960-8984-84b8453f44a2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:34:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624901751</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T17:36:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2fddc9f0-d836-11eb-bdbf-e76413615f63" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2fddc9f0-d836-11eb-bdbf-e76413615f63" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nier Reincarnation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nier Reincarnation]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
