Previously, not only did LG not list the price of the OLED R in the US, you had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"><ins>call a sales representative to buy one</ins></a>. Now all that’s in between you and the company&#39;s futuristic TV is an “Add to Cart” button and about the cost of a down payment on a house in the Bay Area.</p><p>For that amount of money, you get a 65-inch 4K TV that can take on different viewing positions. In its signature “Line View” mode, only part of the OLED R is visible to display the time, weather and other bits of information. It’s also possible to lower the display to do away with letterboxing when watching a movie. Other features include support for Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and HomeKit. And while the panel doesn’t get as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html"><ins>bright as LG’s latest G1 sets</ins></a>, it can still output gaming content at 4K and 120Hz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’re looking for a more affordable entry into LG’s OLED TV ecosystem, the company’s 2021 lineup starts at a much more approachable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2021-oled-tv-pricing-c1-g1-a1-151137971.html"><ins>$1,299</ins></a>.

The experiment won’t change the icon you’ll see when you connect to a website over HTTP. It will continue to say “Not Secure” in the address bar.</p><p>Despite all that it’s doing to make HTTPS as ubiquitous as possible, Google says it will continue to support HTTP for the time being.

The company announced that it&#39;s pushing out the third beta of Android 12 today, and it brings features like scrolling screenshots, enhanced auto-rotate and more. For developers, Google said this is the &quot;last beta release before the Platform Stability milestone,&quot; which means they can begin to test their apps for the next platform. Beta 3 will also include the final Android 12 APIs and official SDK.&nbsp;</p><p>Those may not seem obviously impactful for the average user. What will feel more immediately useful are  scrolling screenshots, which Google said will work &quot;out-of-the-box for most apps.&quot; With Beta 3, when you snap an image of your screen, you&#39;ll see a new &quot;Capture more&quot; button. Tap that, and you&#39;ll extend the boundaries of your screenshot to get all the content available, after which you can adjust the crop. Google said it&#39;s &quot;continuing to iterate on scrolling screenshots&quot; and &quot;also working to provide support for a wider variety of content (such as web content),&quot; so it&#39;s possible this version isn&#39;t what you&#39;ll see when Android 12 officially launches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e49b8330-e422-11eb-bbff-c0081a18321d" alt="Two screenshots showing how the scrolling screenshot feature in the third Android 12 beta will work.

As opposed to relying only on accelerometers/gyroscopes to detect the orientation of your phone, this can make auto-rotate more responsive. It&#39;s &quot;especially helpful for people who are using their devices while lying down on a couch or in bed, for example,&quot; Google said. If you don&#39;t like the idea of your camera being used to see how you&#39;re holding up your phone, it may help to know that the company said the feature lives in its Private Compute Core and the &quot;images are never stored or sent off the device.&quot; Enhanced auto-rotate will be available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">the Pixel 4</a> and newer Pixel devices.</p><p>If you&#39;re on an older or non-Pixel phone, you&#39;ll also see some improvements. Google said it &quot;optimized the animation and redrawing and added an ML-driven gesture-detection algorithm&quot; that&#39;s reduced the base auto-rotate feature&#39;s latency by 25 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature on Beta 3 is platform support for Google&#39;s on-device search engine called AppSearch. It&#39;ll allow developers to offer better search tools in their apps, and also offer them the option of participating in a central index &quot;that&#39;s maintained for the entire system in Android 12 (and later releases).&quot; Those who opt-in to the central index will enable Google to show data from their apps in overall system searches. Developers can also choose to &quot;securely share data with other apps, allowing them to search your app&#39;s data as well as their own.&quot; That means one day, if they decide to enable it, apps like Tinder and Spotify could search data within your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram apps, for example.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/542d42a0-e424-11eb-bfae-276b7526579b" alt="An animation showing how Game Modes will work in Android 12 when the upcoming game dashboard arrives later this year.

Many other features on Beta 3 are also behind-the-scenes, like the new ability for enterprises to set camera and mic restrictions on devices they manage. Android 12&#39;s Game Mode APIs will let developers respond appropriately to different profiles selected by the player, &quot;like better battery life for a long commute, or performance mode to get peak frame rates,&quot; for example. These will be part of an &quot;upcoming game dashboard which provides an overlay experience with quick access to key utilities during gameplay&quot; that will be available on select devices later this year.</p><p>We&#39;re still eagerly awaiting the addition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">the Material You design</a> scheme that Google unveiled at I/O earlier this year, but as Android 12 approaches platform stability and a final release, it looks like most of the features we were expecting are here. If you&#39;re eager to test out this preview and can&#39;t wait for the official launch, you can enroll in Google&#39;s beta program. As always, we must caution that preview software is not guaranteed to be stable and you should back up your data before installing the beta. Whether you check out this early build or wait for a little longer, it does seem like a meaty update is coming for Android users that could be worth the anticipation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-3-update-available-today-scrolling-screenshot-170040876.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bdc0305-7527-486f-8bc7-70304612166a</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626275837</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T15:17:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" width="1000" height="563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12 Beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12 Beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Vive Focus 3 is the best standalone VR headset and no, you should not buy it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><p>After the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-28-oculus-rift-review.html">Oculus Rift</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-05-htc-vive-review.html">HTC Vive</a> launched in 2016, bringing virtual reality into homes for the first time, the two companies have gone in very different directions. While Oculus leaned more toward mainstream consumers, especially with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">last year’s Quest 2</a>, the Vive targeted businesses and the tech savvy. That strategy hasn&#39;t always worked out in Vive&#39;s favor — the long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-htc-vive-cosmos-review.html">Cosmos headset was a disappointment </a>— but it probably makes more sense than competing with Facebook&#39;s practically limitless resources head-on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="73158178-a34e-45b4-b58b-679f8dfba9d2"/><p>Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">Vive Focus 3</a>, a $1,300 standalone headset that&#39;s really only meant for businesses. Because it costs $1,000 more than the Oculus Quest 2, the Focus 3 unsurprisingly offers better hardware, ergonomics and build quality than Oculus&#39;s headset. It&#39;s the difference between building a device that&#39;s meant to be used throughout the day in professional settings, and something you may use once in a while for gaming. The Vive Focus 3 is meant to get shit done.</p><p>At first glance, the Focus 3 certainly looks more like a premium VR workhorse than the Quest 2. While the Oculus headset has flimsy cloth straps and a minimalist goggle design, the Focus 3 looks like an expensive pair of ski goggles fashioned into a VR device. Its magnesium alloy frame is still technically plastic, but it feels sturdier than the Quest&#39;s flimsy case (HTC Vive claims it’s 20 percent lighter and five times stronger than traditional plastic). As much as I liked the Quest 2, you can instantly feel how much Oculus skimped on its materials to reach that low $299 price.</p><p>While Oculus leaned into the sleek and curvy Apple gadget aesthetic, HTC Vive went for sharper lines and a more elaborate design. The Focus 3&#39;s headstrap, for example, looks far more involved with a plastic frame, tons of cushioning and a rear dial to tighten everything up. It&#39;s also angled around the sides so it never touches your ears, which goes a long way toward making the VR experience feel more comfortable. The rear part of the strap may look chunky, but that&#39;s because it also houses the Focus 3&#39;s battery pack. Putting a bit more junk in the trunk helps to balance its weight, so it&#39;s not leaning down on your nose uncomfortably like some earlier VR headsets. (The Quest 2&#39;s Elite Strap and rear battery pack offers a similarly balanced feel, so the Focus 3&#39;s design isn&#39;t completely innovative.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/287a07d0-e4bd-11eb-b5bf-6bb30a5c0665" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="438d8813-5011-3c22-a7bf-034ac2c5d1c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Focus 3&#39;s battery pack is removable, which allows businesses to keep a single headset running continuously throughout the day. One downside to this unique battery design is that the Focus 3 charges via a proprietary AC adapter, despite having a USB-C port. As a concession, the company includes a dual USB-C cable that connects to the headset and can charge both controllers simultaneously. Your desk may end up looking like a sea of cables, but at least you can make sure all your VR gear is charged.</p><p>While its design shows just how much HTC Vive has learned over the years, it&#39;s what&#39;s under the hood that  makes the Focus 3 special. It&#39;s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR 2 chip, similar to the Quest 2, but it&#39;s also running at a higher clock speed. (To get faster and more consistent performance, HTC Vive also squeezed in a heat pipe and cooling fan at the front of the headset.) The Focus 3&#39;s displays offer  5K resolution (4,896 by 2,448 pixels), a smooth 90Hz refresh rate and a wide 120-degree field of view. In comparison, the Quest 2&#39;s screen is close to 4K and has an estimated 90- to 100-degree field of view (depending on where you position the lenses). Both headsets offer LCDs with RGB sub-pixels, which offers a boost in sharpness and clarity compared to PenTile OLED screens from earlier models.</p><section data-eng-breakout="51c9a03763514f32af2d865c6712fcc8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf51-e4bd-11eb-a7f7-6ee800969b6e" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3"></section><p>As far as VR technology goes, the Focus 3 has just about everything you&#39;d want in a modern headset. But there are simple, less technical upgrades that I appreciated too, like its support for large 150mm-wide glasses. It usually takes a bit of effort for me to squeeze a headset over my frames, and they inevitably get yanked out whenever I step out of VR. But I never had to deal with that on the Focus 3, thanks to its roomy interior. There&#39;s also an IPD adjustment dial to help you fine-tune exactly how its lenses hit your eyes; the Quest 2 only gives you a few options to adjust IPD. The elaborate padding around the front and rear also goes a long way toward making you forget you&#39;re even wearing a VR headset.</p><p>Even the Focus 3&#39;s controllers are better than anything we&#39;ve seen from HTC Vive before. They look similar to Oculus&#39;s, with a round tracking ring, face buttons, as well as the standard grip and trigger buttons. Clearly, they&#39;re light years beyond the enormous controllers that the original HTC Vive came with. Still, Oculus has the edge when it comes to overall ergonomics. The Quest 2&#39;s gamepads are contoured to better fit your hands, especially during fast-paced games. Holding the Focus 3&#39;s controllers, meanwhile, feels more awkward during lengthy VR sessions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2877bde0-e4bd-11eb-9b55-e06a17df7af6" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="c1d6ea36-a10d-30ce-bf0a-020b519c5977"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thankfully, though, the headset itself is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and it delivers the most immersive standalone virtual reality experiences I&#39;ve seen yet. I wandered the Louvre in <em>Mona Lisa Beyond the Glass</em>, which let me get inches away from several classic da Vinci paintings. If I tried to do that in real life, I&#39;m sure some security guards would swiftly kick me out. But in VR, I could admire the detail in every work of art. I was also surprised just how great everything looked in the Focus 3. There was more detail than in any Quest 2 experience I&#39;ve seen, and the large field of view genuinely made me feel like I was walking through the Louvre&#39;s ornate halls, instead of just peering in through a pair of VR binoculars.</p><p>Similarly, I had a genuine sense of walking through meadows and tropical beaches in the Nature Treks VR experience. The Focus 3&#39;s sharp display once again shined when I peered at statues and wildlife up close, but the detail was limited by its mobile hardware. 360-degree YouTube videos also looked fantastic when I fired them up in Firefox VR, but the experience can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the source. And even though the headset doesn&#39;t have beefy near-field speakers like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-reverb-g2-review-vr-windows-mixed-reality-130012057.html">HP Reverb G2</a> .</p><p>I was surprised that the Focus 3 didn&#39;t include any sort of built-in multimedia app for watching VR videos, but that really underscores one of its biggest problems: The Focus 3 has a far more limited software library than the Quest. While Oculus has pushed for high-profile exclusives and popular games, like <em>Vader Immortal </em>and <em>Beat Saber</em>, the HTC VivePort store feel practically anemic. There are a handful of shared titles across both platforms, like <em>Last Labyrinth </em>and <em>Tokyo Chronos</em>, but it&#39;s clear they aren&#39;t a big focus for HTC Vive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf50-e4bd-11eb-aff7-e549ecbc5902" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="e1dc6f3a-73d9-3135-bf39-46d874ce91a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>At this point, even installing new experiences is more of a pain on the Focus 3, since you need to take off the headset to purchase apps and games from your web browser. Meanwhile, the Quest and Quest 2 let you buy things from within the headset and a mobile app. But I suppose that&#39;s not a huge problem for HTC Vive, since the Focus 3 isn&#39;t meant for consumers at all. Instead, IT departments will likely preload the software their workers actually need. (There&#39;s also going to be a Vive Business App Store eventually, though it&#39;s unclear if that will offer a better purchasing experience.)</p><p>That&#39;s one reason why we&#39;re not scoring this review. This $1,300 headset isn&#39;t meant to be consumer friendly. And honestly, I couldn&#39;t even test some of the more popular business apps, like Vive Sync&#39;s virtual collaboration tool and Engage&#39;s event app. HTC Vive&#39;s previous Focus headsets also gained a reputation for being easy ways to train employees using apps like Virti. And while that app certainly looks cool in the Focus 3, I can&#39;t exactly tell if it&#39;s offering effective training or not.</p><p>There are also features I haven&#39;t been able to effectively test out. The Focus 3 offers Vive Business Streaming, which lets you connect the headset to a VR PC over a USB 3.2 cable or Wi-Fi. But it&#39;s apparently very picky, as none of the USB cables I used were even recognized by the software (and some would just throw an error saying they weren&#39;t USB 3.0 capable, even though I <em>knew</em> they were). You can also stream PC VR over Wi-Fi, but that only works if your computer is connected directly to your router over Ethernet, and if you have a strong wireless connection with the headset. That just wasn&#39;t possible in my basement office. I&#39;m hoping HTC Vive works out its connection requirements, especially since Oculus Link on the Quest is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-link-widens-usb-support-214755370.html">far less demanding when it comes to cables</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf52-e4bd-11eb-9f1e-95f11c8315bd" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="4cc1f931-735c-36f0-aef4-ac30ca6bb200"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>No matter how you cut it, the Quest 2 is still the standalone VR headset most consumers should buy. But the Focus 3 is perfect for businesses looking for something a bit more sturdy and powerful. For them, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,300 device" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">$1,300 device</a> makes more sense than investing tens of thousands on more elaborate training tools.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3f0095e-5d29-4018-a4be-5a62774d660e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626280765</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T16:52:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook wants the FTC's tech-critic chair to step back from antitrust decisions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon isn&#39;t the only one asking for Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">step away from cases</a>.

It also launched the more mild-mannered, but much cheaper and still pretty well-equipped Blade 15 Base, also equipped with Intel&#39;s latest 11th-generation CPUs.</p><p>The Blade 17 is certainly the star of this show,  as it comes with Intel&#39;s 8-core 11th-generation Core i9-11900H, the same we saw in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razers-new-blade-15-laptop-features-intels-latest-11-th-gen-h-series-chips-110051482.html">Blade 15 laptop</a> earlier this year. As Intel&#39;s first 10-nanometer gaming PC chips, it delivers a 19 percent speed bump over equivalent last-gen CPUs, Intel claims. You can also clock the chip up to 4.9 GHz while seeing a stock PL1 power draw of 65 watts. All of that means you should see more performance and power efficiency at the same time, according to Razer and Intel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/49603170-e4b0-11eb-b7d5-12f42a6ae620" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs" data-uuid="27ba197d-88a1-370c-a2d2-983c85abee8a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>To compliment that CPU, you can get the Blade 17 with up to an RTX 3080 GPU in either 8GB or 16GB configurations, depending on the display. And there are three display choices: you can get it with a 120Hz 4K HDR 400 nit touch display for content creation (with the 16GB VRAM RTX 3080 configuration), a 360Hz 1080p display for the fastest gaming possible, or a 240Hz 2,560 x 1,440 display for a blend of the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other specs include 32GB of 3,200 MHz Dual-Channel DDR4 RAM (upgradeable to 64GB), up to a 4TB NVMe SSD (with an open M.2 slot) and numerous ports: Two Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB-C 3.2 Gen2), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, HDMI 2.1 and a UHS-III SD card reader. It also comes with WiFi6, a 1080p webcam with Windows Hello IR, THX spatial audio support, a 4-mic array and a 70.5 WHr battery.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68cdb1e0-e4b0-11eb-b5eb-c0b1c228fdb8" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs" data-uuid="0d3a0f96-5ca0-356a-9631-1896e8f68a13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>All of that fits in a 6.06 pound squarish body with typical Razer styling that&#39;s relatively slim at 19.9 mm. The Blade 17 is now available for pre-order at $2,400, but you&#39;ll pay up to $3,700 for the 4K display-equipped model with 32GB of RAM and an RTX 3080 with 16GB of DDR6 VRAM.&nbsp;</p><p>The Blade 15 Base (below) is more modestly equipped than either that model or the Blade 15 we saw in May. However, it still has respectable components including Intel&#39;s 8-core i7-11800H processor and up to RTX 3070 8GB graphics. It also comes with either a 144Hz 1080p IPS, THX certified display or a 165Hz QHD display with up to 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a71ec240-e4b0-11eb-be6f-90a7c832e7d9" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs" data-uuid="61499674-178e-3ebd-ae70-9dbc64c8680f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Other features on the Blade 15 Base include a single Thunderbolt 4 port (USB-C), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, HDMI 2.1 and Gigabit ethernet. That&#39;s a bit of a letdown from the Blade 15 advanced, which has an extra Thunderbolt port and an SD UHS III card reader. However, you&#39;ll also pay considerably less, as the Blade 15 Base starts at $1,800, compared to the $2,300 starting price of the Blade Advanced.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-17-11th-gen-intel-core-i9-cpu-150043505.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5945142-c5e0-4ff3-ae2c-0faefad60571</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626274822</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T15:00:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17d3a920-e4ab-11eb-a1ff-2b89988e1d9c" width="1266" height="827" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17d3a920-e4ab-11eb-a1ff-2b89988e1d9c" width="1266" height="827" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft unveils Windows 365, a Windows 10 PC in the cloud]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Windows 365, a new service announced today at the Microsoft Inspire conference, is basically an unintentional riff on the Yo Dawg meme: Microsoft put Windows in the cloud so you can run a Windows computer while you&#39;re running your computer. You can just <a href="https://microsoft.com/Windows-365">call it a Cloud PC</a>, as Microsoft does. It&#39;s basically an easy-to-use virtual machine that lets you hop into your own Windows 10 (and eventually Windows 11) installation on any device, be it a Mac, iPad, Linux device or Android tablet. Xzibit would be proud.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547ab00-e4a6-11eb-95dd-74878b12b284" alt="Windows 365" data-uuid="487b70ae-02f6-32ac-b74d-55ce57dcace3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>While Windows 365 doesn&#39;t come completely out of nowhere — rumors about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-cloud-pc-service-release-date-report-181551713.html">some kind of Microsoft cloud PC effort </a>have been swirling for months — its full scope is still surprising. It builds on Microsoft&#39;s Azure Virtual Desktop service, which lets tech-savvy folks also spin up their own virtual PCs, but it makes the entire process of managing a Windows installation in a far-off server far simpler. You just need to head to <a href="http://windows365.com/">Windows365.com</a> when it launches on August 2nd, choose a virtual machine configuration, and you&#39;ll be up and running. (Unfortunately, we don&#39;t yet know how much the service is going to cost, but Microsoft says it will reveal final pricing on August 1st.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Windows 365 likely isn&#39;t going to mean much for most consumers, but it could be life-changing for IT departments and small businesses. Now, instead of managing local Windows installations on pricey notebooks, IT folks can get by with simpler hardware that taps into a scalable cloud. Windows 365 installations will be configurable with up to eight virtual CPUs, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage at the time of launch. Microsoft is also exploring ways to bring in dedicated GPU power for more demanding users, Scott Manchester, the director of Program Management for Windows 365, tells us.</p><p>Smaller businesses, meanwhile, could set up Windows 365 instances for their handful of employees to use on shared devices. And instead of lugging a work device home, every Windows 365 user can securely hop back into their virtual desktops from their home PCs or tablets via the web or Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop app. During a brief demo of Windows 365, running apps and browsing the web didn&#39;t seem that different than a local PC. It&#39;s also fast enough to stream video without any noticeable artifacts, Manchester says. (Microsoft is also using technology that can render streaming video on a local machine, which it eventually passes over to your Cloud PC.) You&#39;ll also be able to roll back your Cloud PC to previous states, which should be helpful if you ever accidentally delete important files.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d552ce90-e4a6-11eb-bf69-abc54a65a501" alt="Windows 365" data-uuid="45ae57cc-2679-3d37-90f0-f0a13cb947d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>While the idea for Windows 365 came long before the pandemic, Microsoft workers spent the last year learning first-hand how useful a Cloud PC could be. They used a tool meant for hybrid work — where you can easily switch between working in an office or remotely — while stuck at home during the pandemic.</p><p>But why develop Windows 365 when Azure Virtual Desktop already exists? Manchester tells us that Microsoft noticed a whopping 80 percent of AVD customers were relying on third-party vendors to help manage their installations. &quot;Ultimately, they were looking for Microsoft to be a one-stop-shop for them to get all the services they need to,&quot; he said said.</p><p>That statistic isn&#39;t very surprising. Virtualizing operating systems has been a useful local tool for developers over the last few decades, but it&#39;s typically been a bit too difficult for mainstream users to manage on their own. And even though a tool like Azure Virtual Desktop brought it to the cloud (Manchester assures us that&#39;s not going anywhere either), it&#39;s even more difficult to manage.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Windows 365 doesn&#39;t mean, at least at this point, is the end of traditional computers. &quot;I think we&#39;ll still continue to have great client PC experiences,&quot; said Melissa Grant, director of Product Marketing for Windows 365, in an interview. &quot;You know we have a relationship with our laptops. It is our sort of home and hub for our computing experience. What we want to offer with Windows 365 is the ability to have that same familiar and consistent Windows experience across other devices.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-365-cloud-virtual-pc-150022333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce821c63-d2a7-4c2f-a812-7e93dcc091df</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626273922</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T14:45:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547d210-e4a6-11eb-affc-b75be7d25631" width="960" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547d210-e4a6-11eb-affc-b75be7d25631" width="960" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 365]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 365]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox family app now lets parents set spending limits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to worry about your kids going on a game shopping spree, at least if you&#39;re part of a Windows or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Xbox household</a>.

That depends on who you ask. PUIG’s perfumiers, who produce scents for Paco Rabanne, believe that the future smells sexy, confident and energetic. That’s how they’re choosing to market Phantom, the fashion house’s latest fragrance-cum-piece of retro-futurist art. Phantom comes in a robot-shaped bottle that, when you tap your phone on the NFC tag embedded into its head, welcomes you into its own digital world. Digital trinkets on offer will include interactive filters, personalized playlists, augmented reality filters and more.</p><p>Paco Rabanne is the nom de guerre of Spanish designer Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo, who in the ‘60s was a pioneering figure in the fashion world. Both he, and the house that bears his name, has had an appreciation for the absurdity of science fiction. Rabanne began producing dresses with metal and plastic, glued, or stitched together with wire, rather than sewing. His couture work graces pretty much every retrospective of ‘60s fashion and, far more than his contemporaries, embodies the “space age” fashion of the era.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Phantom is intended as a love letter to that history, with retro-futurist design that wouldn’t have looked out of place in <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/ffc/2016/00000005/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=xupeous88n0h.x-ic-live-02"><em>Barbarella</em></a>. The bottle is heavy, with the traditional lower-case “pr” logo in its torso, with the outline of the “p” made out of glass. That lets you watch the water line fall as you spritz yourself every morning with the scent. It comes in two sizes: 100ml (which I’ve seen and used) and 150ml, only the latter of which is refillable.</p><p>Of course, Phantom isn’t just a fancy bottle, but the key to a whole online world of digital goodies. The top of its bottle houses an NFC chip that, when tapped, welcomes the owner’s smartphone to a list of digital trinkets as a reward for buying the bottle. At the time of writing, only two items are available, but the company says that the list of items will grow over time, as outlined above.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/10afed80-d8d9-11eb-bbfb-7f2ad7fda973" alt="Image of the NFC tag at the top of the Paco Rabanne Phantom bottle." data-uuid="7e5205d9-f01d-362a-b937-1331aabf5e91"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>First up, Boombot lets you pick a date to get a Spotify “playlist of bangers that were number one on that day.” Upon closer analysis, it looks like it’s limited to the US charts, but you’ll be able to open the playlist in Spotify and groove to half a century of tunes. It’s a feature that you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever used a website like <a href="https://mybirthdayhits.com/">MyBirthdayHits</a>, which looks a little less beautiful but does a very similar job.</p><p>Second and for now last, is an exclusive Instagram filter called Paco Rabanne’s Phantom Philter. This sees a tiny AR version of the bottle sit on your shoulder, fly around your head or tell someone that it loves them, its eyes and head motion are synched to yours, too. And it’s fun, fun enough for at least one selfie with the little cartoon.</p><p>But the sci-fi isn’t just in the clothes that Phantom is wearing, but in how the fragrance was created in the first place. Perfumiers worked in collaboration with an AI that helped them explore new possibilities in crafting the scent. According to the company, the team conceived of a new smell, and then programmed the formula into an AI, which ran through a series of as-yet untried combinations to make reactions to the smell more intense.</p><p>In Phantom’s case, perfumier Loc Dong wanted to try and “over-dose” a molecule called styrallyl acetate. When he suggested this to the computer, it recommended that Dong use “ten times the usual amount,” compared to a modern perfume. Similarly, the lavender used in the fragrance was sourced through “molecular distillation” which produces a “very modern lavender note.”</p><p>In a statement, Paco Rabane added that the fragrance was tested on men aged 18-35, to determine how it made them feel. They said that Phantom made them feel “sexiness,” “alertness” and “energy,” although the specifics on that testing is a little loose.</p><p>Now, I’m no perfume reviewer, a job that I’ll leave to the vastly more qualified people over at Fragrantica. (Who knew that people could sniff a scent and wish that the designers had added more Bergamot?) I would describe Phantom as a sweet musk, one that even hours after applying, felt strong and persistent. It’s certainly a more energetic smell than the one I’m used to — my aftershave of choice is Chanel Allure Homme Sport — and felt more productive as a consequence. In fact, Phantom is a strong scent but not an unpleasant or overpowering one, and everyone who, in these COVID-sensitive times, I’ve invited to sniff me seemed to agree.</p><p>All in all, it smells pretty good.</p><p>I don’t know if the digital goodies on offer will be a compelling draw here, at least not on current evidence. Maybe this is for those menswear influencers I see all the damn time on Instagram, even if they’re more commonly repping YSL and Celine. Perhaps a little AR robot, sitting on their shoulder while they smoke and drink coffee, reclining on a Paris park bench, is what they need to bolster their effortful laid back cool. But, fundamentally, you’re going to buy this thing because it smells nice, not because you get a free Instagram filter… right?</p><p>Phantom by Paco Rabanne is launching on August 1st, 2021, and will be available in the US at Macy’s, Nordstrom’s, Dillard’s and Sephora.

In 2020, necessitated by the pandemic, Apple started offering those tutorials online, hosting the sessions over Cisco Webex. Starting today, the company is making Today at Apple tutorials available on YouTube.</p><div id="caf099fe87e64df58f527c3537ba8115"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The first one will teach you how to draw yourself as a Peanuts character in Pages.

Starting today, subscribers will see a new top 10 list on kids and family profiles that ranks the streamer&#39;s most popular children&#39;s shows and movies. Netflix says the leaderboard will be updated daily to reflect what its 208 million customers are watching in 93 countries across the globe. Viewers can access the top 10 in the kids homepage or in the ‘New &amp; Popular’ section in the menu bar across devices, barring Apple TV.</p><p>To help parents keep track of what their children are watching, Netflix is also sending out a biweekly email newsletter crammed with recommendations based on kids&#39; viewing habits, including the their thematic preferences (like science or friendship shows), and tips on the streamer&#39;s parental controls. That will land in the inbox of parents who have a kids profile set up starting July 16th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The features arrive as Netflix ramps up its kids&#39; content in the face of stiff competition from streaming rivals. On Tuesday, the company extended its US licensing deal for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Universal&#39;s animated film slate</a>, giving it access to Illumination and Dreamworks movies such as <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>. In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/netflix-and-cocomelon-are-teaming-up-for-more-youtube-style-programming"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>revealed that the streamer had struck a partnership with Moonbug Entertainment for new shows based on its popular YouTube properties CoComelon, Blippi and Little Baby Bum.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix&#39;s recent high-profile kids releases include a cooking show starring Michelle Obama titled <em>Waffles + Mochi </em>and the Lord and Miller produced animated movie <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-animated-comedy-arrives-april-30th-110511249.html"><em>The Mitchells vs the Machines</em></a>. In the past, the streaming service has used<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-20-netflix-interactive-shows.html">interactive shows</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-netflix-acquires-storybots.html">IP acquisitions</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-netflix-unveils-new-shows-aimed-at-preschoolers.html">series aimed at preschoolers</a> to keep families coming back.</p><p>The competition has also seized upon kids content as a means of attracting subscribers. Earlier this year, HBO Max <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/ca/media-release/hbo-max/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new">ordered</a> a raft of new Cartoon Network shows, bumping up its slate to 300 hours of children&#39;s originals and 3,000 hours of library programming. Disney, meanwhile, has unloaded its vault of cherished family classics onto Disney+, along with Pixar exclusives and spinoffs such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-pixar-luca-review-160036700.html"><em>Luca</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-monsters-inc-series-disney-plus.html"><em>Monsters at Work</em></a><em>. </em>Paramount+ also just announced a <a href="https://www.avclub.com/paramount-plus-is-making-a-new-live-action-fairly-oddpa-1847277976"><em>Fairly OddParents</em></a> live-action reboot to add to its Nickelodeon line-up.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-parents-kids-emails-130039358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e4badaa-080d-46b3-b494-d3d040fd589c</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626271290</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T14:01:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f33d8f50-e495-11eb-bedf-4212278b42f4" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f33d8f50-e495-11eb-bedf-4212278b42f4" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is crowdfunding Echo Dots designed by Diane von Furstenberg]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest set of crowdfunded Echo devices aim for luxury over eccentricity.

It’s tempting to turn to Apple’s own accessories — and in some cases, you should — but there’s a slew of alternatives that work just as well and are often more affordable. We tested out a bunch of cases, keyboards, styli and other miscellany to see which iPad accessories are worth buying.</p><h2>Cases and stands</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/31915420-c607-11ea-96b7-f977684d3a6f" alt="Otterbox Symmetry Case for iPad Pro"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve always been that person who takes her new smartphone or tablet out of the box and immediately puts it in a case. While some detest hiding the true form of their new gear, it’s undeniable that cases provide protection for probably the most expensive tech you own. Apple’s Smart Covers for its various iPads are fine, but they’re overpriced and most of them don’t give your iPad any edge protection. Similar alternatives abound, some of which do surround the edges of an iPad. I’ve found <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:ProCase" href="https://amzn.to/3xpBI71">ProCase</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MoKo" href="https://amzn.to/2Vlwds9">MoKo</a> make some of the best — even better, they cost a fraction of what Apple’s Smart Cover costs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’re willing to spend a bit more on a case, get something that combines protection and style. Otterbox is an expert when it comes to protection, but its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Symmetry Series 360" href="https://amzn.to/3jTjtD8">Symmetry Series 360</a> series shows that it also has the design chops. Symmetry cases look similar to the Smart Cover, but the clear, scratch-resistant back is sturdy without adding a lot of weight to the iPad and the edge protection is substantial. I also like the extra flap Otterbox added that keeps the screen cover closed and holds the second-generation Apple Pencil to the side of the iPad Pros. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Symmetry Series 360 cases" href="https://fave.co/3yCh3wZ">Symmetry Series 360 cases</a> are available for most new iPads, and while they’re expensive at $90, they’re worth it if you want a great balance of protection and style.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Otterbox Symmetry 360 case at Amazon - $55" href="https://amzn.to/3jTjtD8">Buy Otterbox Symmetry 360 case at Amazon - $55</a></p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/918f7f40-c608-11ea-bbeb-8746127fcb08" alt="ProCase Leather Folio case for iPad Pro"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>A more affordable alternative is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:ProCase&#x002019;s Leather Folio" href="https://amzn.to/3qVRYui">ProCase’s Leather Folio</a>. While ProCase isn’t as well known for protection as Otterbox is, this model has a flexible plastic interior that wraps around most of the iPad’s edges to keep it secure. The lining also surrounds the second-gen Apple Pencil while it magnetically charges against the new iPad Pros, making it one of the more secure cases for those that have the Pencil.</p><p>Leather folios will appeal to a certain type of person. I didn’t think I was that person — until I tried this case. Not only is it attractive, but it’s practical. It has a pocket on the front flap, three notches on which to prop up the iPad at different viewing angles and an elastic strap that can either keep the folio closed or hold the front flap against the back of the iPad while you’re using it. It’s definitely worth its $18 list price for those that want a case that’s just as practical as it is professional.</p><p>All of the cases we like prop up your iPad in some way, but they aren’t the best if you want the device at a comfortable eye level. You’ll want a dedicated tablet stand for that, and there are several out there that let you adjust height, angle and more. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anozer&#x002019;s foldable tablet stand" href="https://amzn.to/3hlalFv">Anozer’s foldable tablet stand</a> is a good option if you’re often on the go. It’s heavier than other stands at one pound and it can be folded (mostly) flat so you can easily throw it in your backpack. While it’s best suited for 7- to 13-inch tablets, it can support certain smartphones, too (or you could get the company’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3jS3WU0">dedicated smartphone stand</a> instead).</p><p>If you’re willing to sacrifice flexibility for something more elegant, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elago&#x002019;s P2 stand" href="https://amzn.to/3qS4pad">Elago’s P2 stand</a> for iPad may be a good fit. It’s made of a single piece of aluminum with a ledge for your iPad and a few well-placed cutouts that you can snake a charging cable through. The ledge is also wide enough to accommodate most iPad cases.

If you’re part of the first crowd, there are tons of inexpensive Bluetooth keyboards that will do the trick.</p><p>I’m partial to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Keys to Go" href="https://amzn.to/3hlaDw5">Logitech’s Keys to Go</a>, an ultra-slim keyboard that almost disappears in your bag. It’s without a doubt one of the most portable Bluetooth keyboards you’ll find and it’s fairly comfortable to type on. Yes, the keys have little travel and a bubbly feel to them, but they’ll let you compose a quick email or respond to a message on Facebook much more easily than you could with the touchscreen. I also like that its wipeable fabric prevents spills and dirt from getting inside the keyboard. Plus, at around $60-$70, it won’t break the bank.</p><p>If you fall into that second category of shopper, there are even more options for you. The most luxurious comes from Apple itself in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Magic Keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/3ABZOxC">Magic Keyboard</a>. The $300 case magnetically attaches to the new iPad Pros and keeps them “floating” above the keyboard and trackpad. We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-magic-keyboard-review-ipad-pro-299-349-130015291.html">praised the Magic Keyboard</a> for its typing comfort and precise trackpad, but docked it for its limited range of motion. It’s easily the fanciest keyboard available for the iPad Pros and it’s one to consider if money is no object — or if you want the most stylish (and arguably most comfortable) keyboard money can buy.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Keys to Go at Amazon - $70" href="https://amzn.to/3hlaDw5">Buy Keys to Go at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Magic Keyboard at Amazon - $290" href="https://amzn.to/3ABZOxC">Buy Magic Keyboard at Amazon - $290</a></p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/52b5ac50-c607-11ea-adf3-12a0fab2524b" alt="Logitech Slim Folio Pro for iPad Pro"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>But as far as protection goes, the Magic Keyboard provides basically as much as Apple’s Smart Cover (which isn’t much). If you need something a bit more durable (and don’t want to spend $300), <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Zagg&#x002019;s $30 Slim Book Go" href="https://amzn.to/3yA0aCL">Zagg’s $30 Slim Book Go</a> could do the trick.

The latter case may be on the thick side, but it has a well laid-out keyboard and a secure flap that holds the Apple Pencil against your tablet.</p><p>If you want something that combines durability with style, we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s $160 Folio Touch" href="https://amzn.to/3yazpox">Logitech’s $160 Folio Touch</a> keyboard case.

It’s also fairly slim and has a similar Apple Pencil-friendly flap that closes the whole thing shut. Plus, the keyboard is joined by a small yet useful trackpad, so you can truly use your iPad as if it were a laptop.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Zagg Slim Book Go at Amazon - $30" href="https://amzn.to/3yA0aCL">Buy Zagg Slim Book Go at Amazon - $30</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Logitech Slim Folio Pro at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3AAnJ0j">Buy Logitech Slim Folio Pro at Amazon - $130</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Logitech Folio Touch at Amazon - $160" href="https://amzn.to/3yazpox">Buy Logitech Folio Touch at Amazon - $160</a></p><h2>Stylus and screen protectors</h2><section data-eng-breakout="5f0e074bd13422fac2fdc11c" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/1557e020-c608-11ea-9e7e-db158d5192d4" alt="Apple Pencil 2nd generation"></section><p>This likely won’t come as a surprise, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Pencil" href="https://amzn.to/3dNUY6s">Apple Pencil</a> is the best stylus you can get for the iPad. Both the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:first-" href="https://amzn.to/3qTimoD">first-</a> and second-generation Pencils are designed to work specifically with iPads and it shows in their seamless writing performance. The second-gen stylus has a double-tap feature that you can customize to a certain degree, and pressure-sensitivity allows you to add as much or as little detail as you want to digital artwork. I highly recommend shelling out $100 or $130 for the Apple Pencil if you’re an artist — you won’t be disappointed.</p><p>But there are other options, too. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Crayon" href="https://amzn.to/36j0vhf">Logitech’s Crayon</a> is more affordable at $70 and it has arguably a better grip than either Apple Pencil.

Aside from that, the other biggest annoyance is that you have to use a Lightning or USB-C cable to charge it (even the newest model for the iPad Pros doesn’t magnetically attach to the tablet for charging). While I wouldn’t recommend the Crayon for serious artists, I would recommend it for anyone who’s on a strict budget, especially digital journal-keepers, hardcore note-takers and the like.</p><p>If you’re a heavy user of the Apple Pencil or some other stylus, you should consider getting a screen protector for your iPad. They pull double-duty: not only do they act as a first line of defense if your iPad goes careening onto the concrete, but they can also enhance the digital drawing and writing experience. Using a stylus on an iPad is strange at first because gliding the stylus nib over a glass surface feels nothing like “normal” writing. Matte screen protectors can get closer to replicating the pen-on-paper experience, and they also prevent the stylus nib from wearing down so quickly. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Paperlike" href="https://fave.co/36gFaVG">Paperlike</a> is the most popular in this space, but <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Bersem&#x002019;s screen protectors" href="https://amzn.to/3hjJ2vw">Bersem’s screen protectors</a> are a great value at $14 for a pack of two.

Apple has provided little guidance to which USB-C hubs and adapters work best with the iPad Pros — there’s no MFi certification for accessories like this yet. Some hubs specifically advertise that they work with the newest iPad Pros, and if you want to be extra safe, I recommend buying one of those that comes from a reputable brand.</p><p>A newcomer in this space is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Satechi&#x002019;s $100 aluminum stand and hub" href="https://amzn.to/3y5VaFS">Satechi’s $100 aluminum stand and hub</a>, a foldable rectangle that cradles your iPad and provides a bunch of useful ports and charging capabilities. The holder itself rotates outward, revealing a hidden, attached USB-C cable and a rubber bumper that keeps the stand in place in your desk. On the back edge are a 4K HDMI socket, one USB-A port, a headphone jack, both SD and microSD card slots and a 60W USB-C connection for charging.</p><p>I liked the versatility of Satechi’s hub. I could easily use it when I needed to prop my iPad up to watch a YouTube video, and by just plugging in the attached cable, I could switch to using my iPad as more of a work device with all of the necessary connectors in place. It’s also surprisingly light at 10 ounces. Combine that with its foldable design and you have a full-featured hub that can easily be stuffed in a bag.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Satechi stand and hub at Amazon - $100" href="https://amzn.to/3y5VaFS">Buy Satechi stand and hub at Amazon - $100</a></p><section data-eng-breakout="5f0e077fd13422fac2fdc127" data-eng-breakout-type="image"><img class="image-url" src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/3464ca00-c608-11ea-af77-dc6cc7382a44" alt="HyperDrive USB-C adapter for iPad Pro"></section><p>Another popular option is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HyperDrive&#x002019;s USB-C adapter" href="https://fave.co/3AEZvSm">HyperDrive’s USB-C adapter</a>. I’ll admit I was skeptical about this one, mostly because so many Amazon reviewers and YouTube personalities have raved about it (and I have a hard time believing a six-port adapter the size of a lighter should cost $90). However, after testing it out, I can say it delivers on its promises: t’s a neat little adapter that’s just large enough to fit an HDMI socket, a USB-C port, a USB-A connection, micro- and regular SD card slots and a headphone jack on its edges. That should cover most things you’d need an adapter for, save for hardwired internet.</p><p>However, what sets the HyperDrive USB-C adapter apart is that it comes with a tool kit that gives you more flexibility in how you use it. The default plate that surrounds the USB-C plug fits iPads without screen protectors, but there’s an included plate that accommodates screen protectors. HyperDrive even included a third plate with a dongle-like attachment so the adapter doesn’t have to sit right up against the iPad. All you need to do is use the tiny screwdriver that’s in the box to switch out the plates.</p><p>I think that somewhat justifies its $90 asking price. So many adapters that hug the iPad Pro’s edges are slick but they become basically unusable if you have a case, skin or screen protector.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy USB-C adapter at HyperDrive - $90" href="https://fave.co/3AEZvSm">Buy USB-C adapter at HyperDrive - $90</a></p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/74486140-c608-11ea-bf7f-b1edc2fc686d" alt="Anker USB-C hub"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>But $90 for an adapter is still a lot of money and I’d only recommend spending that much if you plan on using the iPad Pro as your daily driver.

However, Facebook has now essentially thrown in the towel in that business, selling its internet satellite team to Amazon, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-acquires-facebooks-satellite-internet-group?"><em>The Information</em></a> has reported. For Amazon, it&#39;s a significant step in its effort to develop its Project Kuiper satellite network and catch up with SpaceX&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">Starlink</a> broadband constellation.</p><p>Like Starlink, Project Kuiper is designed to provide low-latency, high-speed broadband connectivity to users around the world. Amazon aims to have a 3,236-satellite constellation in orbit by 2029, with half of it launched by 2026. It also plans to build 12 ground stations around the world to transmit data to and from the satellites.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has said it will spend more than $10 billion to make all that happen and recently received <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-065621687.html">FAA approval</a> for the project. It also announced <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/amazons-project-kuiper-will-seek-multiple-launch-providers-to-carry-its-satellites-to-space/">last year</a> that it would use United Launch Alliance&#39;s ultra-reliable Atlas V rocket for the initial satellite launches.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon has significantly ramped up hiring efforts for Project Kuiper at its Redmond headquarters, with 500 employees currently aboard and 200 open positions. The employees coming from Facebook are reportedly based in the Los Angeles area and include physicists as well as optical, prototyping, mechanical and software engineers.

The reality, as Engadget’s Mat Smith found out, is a lot less romantic than you might have imagined. Before you’re even allowed to strap on Gravity Industries’ real-world jet suit, you’ve got to make sure you’re not over the weight limit of 210 pounds. Then there’s the ban on sportswear fabrics, which are flammable, and you can’t wear sneakers or jewelry while in flight.</p><p>Mat did, however, get through those hurdles and was wired up and ready to float like a real-world Tony Stark. As well as the terror of being hoisted into the air with nothing more than several enormous engines strapped to your body, the heat these things kicked out was immense. Plus, it seemed that for every foot or so you actually lift from the ground, you felt as if you’ve rocketed over a tall building. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gravity-industries-jet-suit-test-impressions-future-lab-festival-of-speed-160009551.html"><strong>Continue Reading</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cuba-blocks-internet-access-220656055.html">Cuba blocks access to Facebook and Telegram</a></h2><h3>It’s in response to protests over the handling of the pandemic.</h3><h3></h3><p>Protests in Cuba, which began Sunday, have led to the Cuban government restricting access to social media and messaging platforms through its state-run internet provider.

This time, Universal has struck a deal with Netflix, specifically for its animated films. The companies have <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-universal-extend-animated-film-license-deal">signed</a> a multi-year licensing agreement that gives the streaming service exclusive access to animated movies from Universal-owned Illumination, such as <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>, which comes out in 2022. They&#39;ve also expanded their partnership to include films from DreamWorks Animation, including the upcoming <em>The Bad Guys</em> and <em>Puss In Boots: The Last Wish</em>.</p><p>Similar to Universal&#39;s pact with Amazon, though, the Netflix deal is a bit complex. Yes, Netflix will have exclusive rights to animated films from Illumination and Dreamworks in the US, but only for a chunk of the 18-month period after the movies&#39; theatrical run. Within the first four months, all Universal films will only be available for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">streaming on Peacock</a>, the streaming service also owned by its parent company Comcast. Netflix will then have exclusive streaming rights for 10 months after that before the movies go back to Peacock for another four months.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once that 18-month period is done, Universal&#39;s animated films will also be available on Amazon Prime Video. Meanwhile, under their new deal, Netflix will license Universal&#39;s full animated and live-action slate four years after their release and will also secure streaming rights to select titles from the studio&#39;s library. While the deal can be a bit confusing, it all boils down to the fact that Netflix will continue having exclusive access to some of what could become the most-watched films on the platform. As <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/netflix-universal-dreamworks-animation-minions-1235018397/"><em>Variety</em></a> noted, Illumination&#39;s <em>The Secret Life of Pets 2</em> is the most-watch Netflix movie in 2021 so far, according to a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2021/07/03/netflix-might-have-just-lost-its-most-popular-movie-ever/?sh=2c1d49701a16">Forbes analysis</a>. Last year, that distinction belonged to another film by Illumination: <em>Despicable Me</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b91694d-ee89-4a7a-93ac-e7b8279b1d33</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 10:54:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626260125</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T10:55:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68012f60-e48a-11eb-97cc-338f49e335e3" width="1600" height="955" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68012f60-e48a-11eb-97cc-338f49e335e3" width="1600" height="955" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Universal/Illumination]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Minions: The Rise of Gru]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Minions: The Rise of Gru]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Loki' will return for a second season on Disney+]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The God of Mischief will chase his glorious purpose in another season.

On Tuesday, Microsoft said that a group operating out of China was using a zero-day remote code execution to attack SolarWinds software. If successfully exploited, the flaw in the IT company&#39;s Serv-U software allows hackers to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads or view and change data, Microsoft noted in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/">blog post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its investigation, Microsoft said it had observed the hacking group targeting organizations in the US military research and development and software sectors. The company has designated the actor as DEV-0322 in reference to its status as an unidentified &quot;development group.&quot; Microsoft explained that it uses the label prior to reaching high confidence about the origin or identity of a hacker. The group operating out of China is using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers to carry out their attacks, Microsoft said.

US intelligence released a joint statement in January naming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-intelligence-agencies-fbi-nsa-cisa-solarwinds-hack-russia-111518166.html">Russia</a> as the most likely source of the hack. The following month, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/exclusive-suspected-chinese-hackers-used-184211352.html"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported that suspected Chinese hackers had exploited a separate flaw in SolarWinds&#39; software to to help breach US government computers last year. The latest vulnerability is not related to the so-called Sunburst supply chain attack, SolarWinds said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-solarwinds-exploit-china-hack-092547713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cef1d67c-9743-4789-92a1-da0e390dd252</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 09:25:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626254340</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T09:19:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/411043d0-9fa4-11eb-9ffd-9cadaeb403e2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/411043d0-9fa4-11eb-9ffd-9cadaeb403e2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SUZANNE CORDEIRO via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The SolarWinds Corp. logo is seen on a sign at the headquarters in Austin, Texas on April 15, 2021 in Austin, Texas. - The United States announced sanctions against Russia  and the expulsion of 10 diplomats in retaliation for what Washington says is the Kremlin's US election interference, a massive cyber attack and other hostile activity. The White House said the sanctions likewise respond to "malicious cyber activities against the United States and its allies and partners," referring to the massive so-called SolarWinds hack of US government computer systems last year.

The new platform is a way for readers to discover new fiction and a new way for authors to generate revenue from the Kindle Direct Publishing service.&nbsp;</p><p>While the name might suggest otherwise, Kindle Vella isn&#39;t available on Amazon&#39;s Kindle e-readers. Rather, you&#39;ll only find it on Amazon.com or the Kindle iOS app (no Android for now). To start with, the service will be limited to US-based authors who publish stories in English.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The serialized stories will run from 600 to 5,000 words per episode, with the first three offered for free. To see subsequent episodes, you&#39;ll need to pay for &quot;tokens,&quot; with prices ranging from $2 for 200 tokens up to $15 for 1,700 tokens. The latter will give you about 34 episodes, though prices per episode depend on the word count — the more words, the more you&#39;ll have to spend.&nbsp;</p><div id="9ecbe83039b54315bc01663af8a3de80"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjBoQrFgOms?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Authors, meanwhile, will receive 50 percent of the revenue along with bonuses based on engagement with the app&#39;s social media-style features. To that end, readers can follow stories to be notified of new episodes, leave a thumbs up for episodes they like, apply a &quot;Fave&quot; for their favorite story of the week (provided they purchase tokens), and share on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. To boost engagement, authors can speak directly to readers at the end of episodes to &quot;share story insights and behind-the-scenes content,&quot; Amazon wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Amazon opened Vella to authors three months ago, &quot;thousands of authors&quot; have published &quot;tens of thousands of Kindle Vella episodes across dozens of genres and microgenre,&quot; Amazon said. Authors appear to be interested as well. &quot;I’ve published close to 30 novels, and I’m enjoying the adventure of writing <em>The Marriage Auction</em> in this new format,” said bestselling author Audrey Carlan in a statement. Whether or not the format takes off now depends on readers — to try it out, you can access Vella <a href="https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fkdp.com%2Fkindle-vella&amp;esheet=52458701&amp;newsitemid=20210713006218&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=kdp.com%2FKindle-Vella&amp;index=10&amp;md5=35e4153bc11f4ea71707d449060f3d31">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-launches-its-kindle-vella-serialized-story-platform-085016781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b73e2a4-9353-4813-af8c-53d312d8ddbc</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:50:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626252049</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T08:41:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/240d5a50-e47a-11eb-b6ed-00b27ffe8814" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/240d5a50-e47a-11eb-b6ed-00b27ffe8814" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon launches its Kindle Vella serialized story platform]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon launches its Kindle Vella serialized story platform]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ransomware group REvil disappears from the internet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Russia-linked ransomware group behind some of the biggest recent cyberattacks has disappeared from the internet. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/13/multiple-revil-ransomware-sites-are-down-on-the-darkweb-.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ransomware-gang-revils-websites-become-unreachable-2021-07-13/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/13/revil-disappears-kaseya-hack/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the websites operated by the group REvil went down in the early hours of Tuesday. Dmitri Alperovitch, former chief technology officer of the cyber firm CrowdStrike, told <em>The Post</em> that the group&#39;s blog in the dark web is still reachable. However, its critical sites victims use to negotiate with the group and to receive decryption tools if they pay up are no longer available. Visitors to those websites now see a message that says &quot;A server with the specified hostname could not be found.&quot;</p><p>REvil took responsibility for a recent string of ransomware attacks that affected around 800 to 1,500 businesses worldwide, including schools. It <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/05/revil-hackers-behind-massive-ransomware-outbreak-drop-demand-to-50m.html">demanded</a> $70 million to restore the data it stole and encrypted. Before that, experts linked the group to the ransomware attacks on IT management software giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html">Kaseya</a> and beef supplier JBS, which chose to pay US$11 million to get its data back.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s unclear why REvil&#39;s websites aren&#39;t accessible anymore. As <em>Reuters</em> mentioned, ransomware gangs tend to vanish and rebrand in case they attract too much attention. President Biden recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/us/politics/biden-putin-ransomware-russia.html">revealed</a> that he told Russian President Vladimir Putin that he expects his government to act on ransomware attacks coming from his country. When asked if the US would attack the servers Russian cybercriminals use to hijack American networks, Biden answered with a resounding &quot;Yes.&quot;</p><p>Alperovitch told <em>The Post</em> that it doesn&#39;t look like REvil&#39;s servers were attacked, which means it&#39;s unlikely a an offensive cyber operation launched by US authorities. Kurtis Minder, the founder of threat intelligence firm GroupSense, told <em>Reuters</em> that <em>if </em>REvil&#39;s sites going down truly was the result of an offensive operation mounted by the US government, he hopes that &quot;collateral damage was a consideration.&quot; Bad actors hold the key to the data they take ransom, and victims would have a tough time recovering theirs if that key gets destroyed or lost.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-revil-disappears-from-the-internet-081251029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d72efb1-5fdd-4e9a-9ed1-c9319e47ff72</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 08:12:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626250408</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T08:13:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f07de4d0-e46e-11eb-b7ff-8113fc2bc6a7" width="6500" height="3500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f07de4d0-e46e-11eb-b7ff-8113fc2bc6a7" width="6500" height="3500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Just_Super via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fingerprint, Computer, Technology, Cyber Security, Lock, Safe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cybersecurity Digital Technology Security]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
