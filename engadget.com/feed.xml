Now, Google has a solution for its Meet app with a new feature that allows you to have up to 25 co-hosts in a meeting, as <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/12/google-meet-co-hosts/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> has reported. That way, they can split chore like muting participants, launching polls, managing Q&amp;As and more, while you focus on the business at hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, the feature was only available to Google Workspace for Education customers. Now, it&#39;s on all of Google&#39;s Meet apps across desktop and mobile, including users with personal Google accounts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, Google introduced new controls for meeting hosts, which can be extended to co-hosts. All hosts will be able to limit who can share their screen, limit who can send chat messages, mute all with one click, end the meeting for all and control who can join the meeting and how they can join with the &quot;quick access&quot; setting. The latter allows participants in the same domain to enter automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quick access” allows automatic video call entry for users in the same domain. If disabled, hosts must join first, and those that are not invited will have to request permission to enter. Otherwise, the host must join first and give permission to anyone who isn&#39;t invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The last feature, the &quot;People&quot; panel, adds search to let hosts quickly find participants if moderation actions are needed. The new features will begin rolling out next week on the web and Meet for Android, and the iOS version will arrive at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-makes-moderation-easier-by-allowing-up-to-25-people-to-co-host-055344666.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">901ee10b-64c0-448a-b59a-f3d6ad475a58</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 05:53:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628834024</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T05:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest Hub will display air quality levels as wildfire season continues]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/thread/120800522/stay-in-the-know-about-the-air-around-you-on-your-nest-display?hl=en">updating</a> its Nest Hub displays with a new feature that displays the air quality index (AQI), <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-start-providing-air-quality-updates-nest-hub-devices"><em>Android Central</em></a> has reported.

But if you have at least $260,000 in the bank, a company called <a href="https://www.gatewaybronco.com/"><ins>Gateway Bronco</ins></a> will happily build you a vintage Bronco that’s specced like a modern EV. This week, it announced two new models, the Fuelie Electric and Luxe-GT Electric, that feature 220 kW electric motors that the company claims can accelerate the former gas-guzzler from zero to 60 miles per hour in less than five seconds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c6dff990-fbbd-11eb-b73b-aabd97d896e3" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Gateway Bronco EV" data-uuid="24048b06-b5cd-3d0a-a86a-d4e7c2581f5c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Gateway Bronco</div></figure><p>Range on the less expensive Fuelie model comes in at a claimed 200 miles, while the Luxe-GT (pictured throughout), which starts at an eye-watering $380,000, can travel up to 300 miles on a single charge. Other noteworthy features include 18-inch wheels that Gateway Bronco has fitted with Wilwood disc brakes and 33-inch Toyo tires. You also get a seven-year warranty on the electric drivetrain. Oh, and the interior looks sublime.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/72f8b7c0-fbbf-11eb-99fe-8296e443d2d5" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Bronco" data-uuid="51e9c2aa-801d-3f82-a0c4-30ddadb12284"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Gateway Bronco</div></figure><p>Even when you account for inflation and the cost of all the modern technology Gateway Bronco has included in the Fuelie and Luxe-GT, a minimum of $260,000 is a lot of money for a restomod of a car that cost $2,194 in 1966. But it’s about the going rate for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electric-ford-bronco-zero-labs-163500928.html"><ins>electric conversions of this type</ins></a>.

Among them: a new technology that can scan the photos on users’ devices in order to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Though the change was widely praised by some lawmakers and child safety advocates, it prompted immediate pushback from many security and privacy experts, who say the update amounts to Apple walking back its commitment to putting user privacy above all else.</p><p>Apple has disputed that characterization, saying that its approach balances both privacy and the need to do more to protect children by preventing some of the most abhorrent content from spreading more widely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>What did Apple announce?</strong></h2><p>Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">three separate updates</a>, all of which fall under the umbrella of “child safety.” The most significant — and the one that’s gotten the bulk of the attention — is a feature that will scan iCloud Photos for known CSAM. The feature, which is built into iCloud Photos, compares a user’s photos against a database of previously identified material. If a certain number of those images is detected, it triggers a review process. If the images are verified by human reviewers, Apple will suspend that iCloud account and report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</p><p>Apple also previewed new “communication safety” features for the Messages app. That update enables the Messages app to detect when sexually explicit photos are sent or received by children. Importantly, this feature is only available for children who are part of a family account, and it’s up to parents to opt in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d4ff9d40-fb96-11eb-9eef-a4cc2fb18968" alt="Apple&#39;s new Messages feature for children will send warnings when sexually explicit images are sent or received. " data-uuid="4b2162e0-2b79-3ef5-9430-3a26a1a69efa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If parents do opt into the feature, they will be alerted if a child under the age of 13 views one of these photos. For children older than 13, the Messages app will show a warning upon receiving an explicit image, but won’t alert their parents. Though the feature is part of the Messages app, and separate from the CSAM detection, Apple has noted that the feature could still play a role in stopping child exploitation, as it could disrupt predatory messages.</p><p>Finally, Apple is updating Siri and its search capabilities so that it can “intervene” in queries about CSAM. If someone asks how to report abuse material, for example, Siri will provide links to resources to do so. If it detects that someone might be searching <em>for</em> CSAM, it will display a warning and surface resources to provide help.</p><h2><strong>When is this happening and can you opt out?</strong></h2><p>The changes will be part of iOS 15, which will roll out later this year. Users can effectively opt out by disabling iCloud Photos (instructions for doing so can be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204570">here</a>). However, anyone disabling iCloud Photos should keep in mind that it could affect your ability to access photos across multiple devices.</p><h2><strong>So how does this image scanning work?</strong></h2><p>Apple is far from the only company that scans photos to look for CSAM. Apple’s approach to doing so, however, is unique. The CSAM detection relies on a database of known material, maintained by NCMEC and other safety organizations. These images are “hashed” (Apple’s official name for this is NeuralHash) — a process that converts images to a numerical code that allows them to be identified, even if they are modified in some way, such as cropping or making other visual edits. As previously mentioned, CSAM detection only functions if iCloud Photos is enabled. What’s notable about Apple’s approach is that rather than matching the images once they’ve been sent to the cloud — as most cloud platforms do — Apple has moved that process to users’ devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19d14270-fb97-11eb-85f3-29411f6e1ef6" alt="Apple&#39;s CSAM hashing system, NeuralHash." data-uuid="24126b46-5516-3a7b-adf1-782bc779a159"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Here’s how it works: Hashes of the known CSAM are stored on the device, and on-device photos are compared to those hashes. The iOS device then generates an encrypted “safety voucher” that’s sent to iCloud along with the image. If a device reaches a certain threshold of CSAM, Apple can decrypt the safety vouchers and conduct a manual review of those images. Apple isn’t saying what the threshold is, but has made clear a single image wouldn’t result in any action.</p><p>Apple also published a detailed technical explanation of the process <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf">here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Why is this so controversial?</strong></h2><p>Privacy advocates and security researchers have raised a number of concerns. One of these is that this feels like a major reversal for Apple, which five years ago refused the FBI’s request to unlock a phone and has put up <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/">billboards </a>stating “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.” To many, the fact that Apple created a system that can proactively check your images for illegal material and refer them to law enforcement, feels like a betrayal of that promise.</p><p>In a statement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">called it</a> “a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company’s leadership in privacy and security.” Likewise, Facebook — which has spent years taking heat from Apple over its privacy missteps — has taken issue with the iPhone maker’s approach to CSAM. WhatsApp chief, Will Cathcart, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-head-apple-child-safety-surveillance-system-201956787.html">described it</a> as “an Apple built and operated surveillance system.”</p><p>More specifically, there are real concerns that once such a system is created, Apple could be pressured — either by law enforcement or governments — to look for other types of material. While CSAM detection is only going to be in the US to start, Apple has suggested it could  eventually expand to other countries and work with other organizations. It’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where Apple could be pressured to start looking for other types of content that’s illegal in some countries. The company’s concessions in China — where Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-chinese-government-control-data-131343119.html">“ceded control”</a> of its data centers to the Chinese government — are cited as proof that the company isn’t immune to the demands of less-democratic governments.</p><p>There are other questions too. Like whether it&#39;s possible for someone to abuse this process by maliciously getting CSAM onto someone’s device in order to trigger them losing access to their iCloud account. Or whether there could be a false positive, or some other scenario that results in someone being incorrectly flagged by the company’s algorithms.</p><h2><strong>What does Apple say about this?</strong></h2><p>Apple has strongly denied that it’s degrading privacy or walking back its previous commitments. The company published a second document in which it <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf">tries to address</a> many of these claims.</p><p>On the issue of false positives, Apple has repeatedly emphasized that it is only comparing users’ photos against a collection of known child exploitation material, so images of, say, your own children won’t trigger a report. Additionally, Apple has said that the odds of a false positive is around one in a trillion when you factor in the fact that a certain number of images must be detected in order to even trigger a review. Crucially, though, Apple is basically saying we just have to take their word on that. As Facebook’s former security chief Alex Stamos and security researcher Matthew Green wrote in a joint <em>New York Times </em>op-ed, Apple hasn’t provided outside researchers with much visibility into how all this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html">actually works</a>.</p><p>Apple <a href="http://apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf">further</a> says that its manual review, which relies on human reviewers, would be able to detect if CSAM was on a device as the result of some kind of malicious attack.</p><p>When it comes to pressure from governments or law enforcement agencies, the company has basically said that it would refuse to cooperate with such requests. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands,” it writes. “We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it.” Although, once again, we kind of just have to take Apple at its word here.</p><h2><strong>If it’s so controversial, why is Apple doing it?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is because the company thinks this is finding the right balance between increasing child safety and protecting privacy. CSAM is illegal and, in the US, companies are obligated to report it when they find it. As a result, CSAM detection features have been baked into popular services for years. But unlike other companies, Apple hasn’t checked for CSAM in users’ photos, largely due to its stance on privacy. Unsurprisingly, this has been a major source of frustration for child safety organizations and law enforcement.</p><p>To put this in perspective, in 2019 Facebook reported 65 million instances of CSAM on its platform, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/online-child-sexual-abuse.html">according to </a><em>The New York Times</em>. Google reported 3.5 million photos and videos, while Twitter and Snap reported “more than 100,000,” Apple, on the other hand, reported 3,000 photos.</p><p>That’s not because child predators don’t use Apple services, but because Apple hasn’t been nearly as aggressive as some other platforms in looking for this material, and its privacy features have made it difficult to do so. What’s changed now is that Apple says it’s come up with a technical means of detecting collections of known CSAM in iCloud Photos libraries that still respects users’ privacy. Obviously, there’s a lot of disagreement over the details and whether any kind of detection system can truly be “private.” But Apple has calculated that the tradeoff is worth it. “If you’re storing a collection of CSAM material, yes, this is bad for you,” Apple’s head of privacy <a href="http://nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html">told</a><em>The New York Times</em>. “But for the rest of you, this is no different.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1d1e05c6-27fe-4bf5-9e29-0ec9d5605925</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 18:30:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628801122</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T20:45:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shubhashish5 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tokyo, Japan - May 23, 2020 : Apple iPhone during iOS update.

The retailer is reportedly leaning toward licensing tools from a company called <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/">BehavioSec</a>.</p><p>&quot;The software does not rely on personally identifiable information or other static data,&quot; a <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/documents/faq/privacy-faq/">FAQ page</a> from BehavioSec states. Instead, the company claims it uses &quot;behavioral biometrics&quot; to generate a profile of how someone types and uses their computer. Its software then utilizes that profile to verify that a hacker or imposter hasn&#39;t compromised an employee&#39;s device. BehavioSec&#39;s website lists Cisco and Deutsche Telekom as &quot;partners,&quot; suggesting Amazon wouldn&#39;t be the first company to use its software. Amazon reportedly looked at other employee monitoring solutions. However, due to &quot;challenges around collecting keystrokes data,&quot; concluded it was best to turn to more &quot;privacy-aware&quot; models like BehavioSec.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the document, Amazon claims it needs such software to combat various security threats. The company points to at least four cases where its security team identified incidents where someone posed as a service agent to obtain customer data. &quot;We have a security gap as we don&#39;t have a reliable mechanism for verifying that users are who they claim they are,&quot; the company states in the document.&nbsp;</p><p>With more of its employees working remotely due to the pandemic, it&#39;s also worried about a higher risk of &quot;data exfiltration.&quot; Amazon points to several hypothetical scenarios it wants to protect itself against, including one where a customer service employee forgets to lock their computer, and a nosy roommate steals the company&#39;s data. By 2022, it estimates the software could help it reduce imposter takeover by 100 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Maintaining the security and privacy of customer and employee data is among our highest priorities,&quot; Kelly Nantel, director of national media relations at Amazon, told Engadget. &quot;While we do not share details on the technologies we use, we continually explore and test new ways to safeguard customer-related data while also respecting the privacy of our employees. And we do this while also remaining compliant with applicable privacy laws and regulations.&quot;</p><p>While Amazon&#39;s reasons for considering BehavioSec appear to be well-intentioned, the company doesn&#39;t have the best history with employee monitoring software. A recent report from <em>CNBC</em> found Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-mentor-app-edriving-delivery-driver-tracking-surveillance-gps-194346304.html">Mentor</a> app was far too overbearing to do its intended job effectively, and it would needlessly penalize drivers for things like going over the occasional bump on the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-behaviosec-keystroke-software-report-175350458.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ed44a83-55ff-43c2-a2d7-7387f2b39770</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628790834</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T17:54:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c539f060-bd64-11eb-bff7-5286159bbbc6" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c539f060-bd64-11eb-bff7-5286159bbbc6" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Ryder via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, WA - MAY 20: A sign is seen outside of an Amazon Go store at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters on May 20, 2021 in Seattle, Washington.

Other datasets are said to include the names of people who own property in the US, which could reveal details about individual users.</p><p>SafeGraph reportedly sells its location data to almost anyone willing to pay for it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is said to be among SafeGraph&#39;s customers, while <em>The New York Times </em>used SafeGraph data for a project that showed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/05/06/opinion/coronavirus-us-reopen.html"><ins>where people were gathering</ins></a> after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions were loosened.

As <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/08/12/2022-polestar-2-price-cut-fwd-features/">reports</a>, the 2022 &quot;entry-level&quot; EV <a href="https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/637040">will start</a> at $45,900 before incentives, or a cool $14,000 below the original dual-motor version&#39;s price. If you&#39;re in California, that cost after incentives could dip to a relatively low $34,900. That&#39;s no mean feat when it offers the longest range of the bunch at an EPA-estimated 265 miles.</p><p>The long-range dual-motor version starts at a lower $49,900 for 2022 ($38,900 after California incentives), with a longer 249-mile range on top of that. The catch, as you might guess, is that you&#39;ll need to add &quot;packs&quot; to get certain creature comforts, regardless of which car you&#39;re buying.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The promised mechanical heat pump, which extends range in chilly conditions, is part of a $4,000 Plus Pack that also includes a full-length glass roof, a &quot;premium&quot; interior (with Harman Kardon audio), vegan seating and cabin illumination. A $3,200 Pilot Pack  adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings and a 360-degree camera.

The pricing still makes the electric fastback more expensive than its most obvious rival, the $39,900 Tesla Model 3 in Standard Range Plus trim. However, it&#39;s now close enough that you might not mind the extra outlay if Polestar&#39;s design is more appealing — and the claimed range is finally competitive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-single-motor-price-range-151503533.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">57af5703-12e3-4fa0-b34c-a047f6bdee23</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:15:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628781203</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T15:13:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Not Tonight 2' tackles capitalism and political greed in an 'alternative' US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years after taking on Brexit in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-29-not-tonight-post-brexit-bouncer-game.html"><em><ins>Not Tonight</ins></em></a>, publisher No More Robots and developer PanicBarn are working on a sequel to the satirical political RPG. <em>Not Tonight 2 </em>takes place in a supposedly alternate version of the US, where &quot;capitalism and political greed have taken center stage and democracy is a thing of the past.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Not Tonight 2 </em>centers around three intertwined stories written by a group of POC artists and authors.

The carrier has <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-customers-get-amc-plus">launched</a> a promo that gives Fios and wireless subscribers up to a year of &#39;free&#39; AMC+ streaming. Not surprisingly, you&#39;ll only get the full 12 months if you spend the most — you&#39;ll have to either sign up for a Mix &amp; Match Fios plan or activate a new line on one of the network&#39;s better unlimited wireless plans (Play More, Do More or Get More) while buying one of the company&#39;s &quot;best&quot; 5G-capable phones.</p><p>Cellular subscribers who either activate a Start Unlimited plan or upgrade to a top-tier 5G phone on an existing line will get a more modest six months of AMC+ service. The promo expires for Fios customers on February 10th, 2022, but there&#39;s no mention of an expiry date for wireless.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Verizon isn&#39;t shy about the timing — <em>The Walking Dead</em> season 11 premieres August 22nd for most viewers, and the company is clearly hoping to reel in customers who want to watch more of AMC&#39;s humans-are-the-real-monsters drama. We&#39;d add that this comes just a day after Samsung revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">Flip 3</a> — the bonus AMC+ access could serve as an incentive to update your phone.</p><p>The question, as with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-free-stadia-pro-5g-internet-subscribers-130032328.html">other carrier perks</a>, is whether or not this is really adding value. Verizon already gives all its users at least six months of Disney+, Discovery+, Apple Arcade, Google Play Pass and Apple Music — if you aren&#39;t a hardcore <em>Walking Dead</em> fan, what&#39;s another service you&#39;ll try a few times and cancel? There&#39;s also the question of pricing — what if you were comfortable dropping the freebies in return for a lower rate? While networks like Verizon don&#39;t say how much it costs to offer bonuses like this, there&#39;s a mounting concern that the costs could add up.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-amc-plus-bonus-offer-142542376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">26340469-8772-4da6-8d64-c4d4621b5684</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 14:25:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628777690</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T14:15:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/73c20cc0-fb73-11eb-bfc3-cc7bc3bdef4c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/73c20cc0-fb73-11eb-bfc3-cc7bc3bdef4c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Josh Stringer/AMC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Norman Reedus as Daryl in 'The Walking Dead' season 11]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Norman Reedus as Daryl in 'The Walking Dead' season 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Hades' is coming to Xbox and PlayStation on August 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zagreus might struggle to escape the Underworld, but he&#39;s no longer bound by the confines of PC and Nintendo Switch. <em>Hades</em>, widely regarded as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-2020-163051873.html">one of the best games of 2020</a>, is <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/blog/hades-xbox-playstation-coming-soon/">coming to</a> Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4 and PS5 on August 13th.

Headsets have come a long way since the launch of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive five years ago. Standalone devices like the Oculus Quest 2 let you hop into virtual reality anywhere, while also giving you the flexibility of streaming virtual reality from powerful PCs. And if you don&#39;t care about dealing with a wired headset, there are a plethora of high-end options out there. Most importantly, there are plenty of memorable VR experiences like <em>Vader Immortal</em> and <em>Half-LIfe: Alyx </em>that you can&#39;t experience outside of a headset.</p><h2>So what makes a good VR headset?</h2><p>I tend to judge them on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It&#39;s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto them. But it takes skill to craft something that&#39;s well balanced and doesn&#39;t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Immersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a low field of view makes it look like you’re looking through a pair of binoculars, which limits the sense of “presence” you can feel in VR. But a wide field of view can make it seem like you’re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth.</p><p>And when it comes to controllers, the best options fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has practically adopted the design of Oculus&#39;s excellent touch controllers, but we&#39;re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve&#39;s finger tracking gamepads.</p><h2>Best VR headset for most people: Oculus Quest 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9f7c78c0-fa04-11eb-af24-b0871afa1509" alt="Oculus Quest 2 VR headset"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Almost a year since its release, the <a href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4">Oculus Quest 2</a> remains the best VR option for the vast majority of consumers. It&#39;s completely cordless, relatively inexpensive (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:starting at $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">starting at $299</a>) and it&#39;s comfortable to wear for long sessions. There&#39;s also a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it&#39;s bundled with Oculus&#39;s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.</p><p>The Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution 1832x1920 per eye, the highest we&#39;ve seen from Oculus. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2&#39;s field of view isn&#39;t the best — it&#39;s been measured at just around 90 degrees — but it&#39;s still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also <a href="https://www.vrfitnessinsider.com/i-boosted-my-quest-2s-field-of-view-halfway-to-a-valve-index-vrcover-foam-pads-fov-rated/">use different face pads</a> to increase its field of view a bit.

That&#39;s double the storage of the original model, giving you even more room to cram in games and VR apps.</p><p>The Quest 2 may not offer the best overall VR experience, but it&#39;s certainly the most accessible headset on the market.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299" href="https://amzn.to/3fQNpgn">Buy Oculus Quest 2 at Amazon - $299</a></p><h2>Best PC VR headset under $600: HP Reverb G2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/221fc520-fa05-11eb-bf1f-39ee1a30d1b7" alt="HP Reverb G2 VR headset"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don&#39;t care about wireless VR, and you want to invest a bit more in a high-quality PC headset, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2" href="https://fave.co/3jmfJs7">HP&#39;s $599 Reverb G2</a> is meant for you. It was developed in cooperation with Valve and has some of the best features from the pricier Index headset, like near-field speakers. The Reverb G2 also has sharp screens, offering 2,160 by 2,160 pixels per eye, a 90Hz refresh rate, and a relatively wide 114-degree field of view.</p><p>It&#39;s also the first Windows Mixed Reality headset to include four tracking sensors, which helps to ensure more accurate VR tracking, especially during fast-paced games. I also give HP  credit for making a headset that’s extremely comfortable thanks to its luxurious amount of cushioning around the eye-piece and rear strap.</p><p>The Reverb G2&#39;s motion controllers weren&#39;t my favorite, but they&#39;re still a big step up from HP&#39;s previous model. You could also upgrade it to use Valve&#39;s finger-tracking controllers, but that involves snagging SteamVR sensors and a lot more setup.

For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we&#39;ve seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it&#39;s still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I&#39;d gladly lose a few pixels to get a smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond any other consumer headset.</p><p>As a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it&#39;s wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it&#39;s not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you&#39;ll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.</p><p>Valve&#39;s finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>feel like a dream. It&#39;s unfortunate that other VR games haven&#39;t fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/377HC11">Buy Index at Valve - $999</a></p><h2>Best VR quality, no matter the cost: HTC Vive Pro 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2</a> is the best-looking PC VR I&#39;ve seen.

I&#39;m less impressed with the large wand controllers, which are exactly the same as the ones that came with the original HTC Vive in 2016.

The social video service is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/furthering-our-safety-and-privacy-commitments-for-teens-on-tiktok-us">limiting</a> the visibility of teens&#39; videos, with the most restrictions applying to the youngest users. Teens aged 13 to 15 are set to private by default, and will have to decide who can see a video the first time they post. They&#39;ll have that option for every video they post beyond that, and they won&#39;t have access to Duet or Stitch features.</p><p>Older teens will see restrictions, too. TikTok will turn off Direct Messages by default for 16- and 17-year-olds joining the service for the first time, and ask existing users to review their settings if they haven&#39;t tried DMs before. The company will also double-check before those older teens enable downloads for their videos.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The social media giant will try to promote healthy usage habits, too. Notifications will turn off for teens under 16 starting at 9PM local time, while 16- and 17-year-olds will receive their alerts until 10PM. This will theoretically help teens wind down, not to mention discourage late-night <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-adds-anti-bullying-comment-controls-130007601.html">bullying</a>.</p><p>TikTok stressed that there was &quot;no finish line&quot; for privacy and safety efforts, and that there would be more to come in the months ahead. The focus is clear, however — TikTok doesn&#39;t want stories of teens facing bullies, creeps and other abusers that found them through public videos and unsolicited messages. In theory, the restrictions provide a gentler introduction to TikTok that helps younger audiences understand the consequences of their actions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-limits-teen-access-130931754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98f73a69-b8f7-407b-bc6c-afb6c077724d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 13:09:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628773774</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T13:09:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/1b6ae310-5d87-11eb-9fed-f2d21d66b6e7" width="5082" height="3388" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LOIC VENANCE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenager presents a smartphone with the logo of Chinese social network Tik Tok, on January 21, 2021 in Nantes, western France.

But today marks the first time that it is launching a<em> flagship</em> phone to the global market as an independent company. Free from the US sanctions that rocked its former parent, Honor is once again able to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-smartphones-google-apps-50-series-huawei-171758485.html">American software</a> (hello, Android 11) and silicon (hello, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Qualcomm</a>). This then, is the start of Honor’s second life, which is beginning with the launch of the Magic3, its first — well, “<em>first</em>” — flagship.</p><p>Historically, Honor was Huawei’s budget play, offering a surprising level of quality and tech for relatively low prices. The Honor 20, for instance, was the sort of phone that made you forget about the need to buy a flagship handset despite its modest sticker. Now, of course, with the freedom (read: obligation) to create high-end handsets, Honor is shuffling its brands. The high end will now be dominated by Magic-branded handsets, while the numbered line (like the Honor 50) will sit in the middle, and the low end now the domain of the X-Series.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design-wise, Honor’s apple did not fall far from Huawei’s tree. From several angles, the Magic3 looks like a Huawei Mate, and this is not the only time I’ll bring this up. Given the sharing of IP and technology between the two companies before the split, this is not a huge surprise. I’m sure that many of the handsets Honor releases over the next couple of years will have that whiff of shared DNA, and like the Mate this phone has a waterfall display, with an 89-degree curve down both sides of the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f235b700-fb64-11eb-bf75-8b98d187afb5" style="height:690;width:1920;" alt="Honor Magic 3" data-uuid="707cdb14-39c4-3ec8-a293-5e196038fb45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Honor</div></figure><p>There are three Magic3 handsets in the range, the vanilla Magic3, Magic3 Pro, and the Magic3 Pro+. Every member of this trio is packing a 6.67-inch, 2,272 x 1,344, always-on flexible OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR 10+. There’s a 94.82 screen-to-body ratio, the ideal fact to wheel out when you need to impress folks in bars, too. The cut-out for imaging plays host to a 13-megapixel, f/2.4 wide camera with a 100-degree wide-angle lens no matter what model you opt for. Although the higher end Pro and Pro+ models are the only ones that pair it with a 3D Time of Flight sensor for face unlocking.&nbsp;</p><p>The real interest, however, is in the lenses on the back of the phone, and Honor is throwing all but the dishwasher at this phone. Arranged in a setup the company is calling &quot;The Eye of Muse,&quot; the regular handsets get a 50-megapixel, f/1.9 lens with Sony&#39;s IMX766 image sensor, a 64-megapixel, f/2.2 monochrome camera and a 13-megapixel, 120-degree f/2.2 ultra-wide camera.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pro, meanwhile, adds a 64-megapixel, f/3.5 OIS telephoto camera with a 3.5x optical zoom, 10x hybrid zoom and 100x digital zoom. The Pro+, meanwhile, swaps out that IMX766 for the larger, f/1.9 1/1.28-inch IMX700 with OIS. You&#39;ll get that 64-megapixel monochrome camera with an f/1.8 aperture, a 64-megapixel 126-degree, f/2.4 ultra-wide camera and that same telephoto lens. (You&#39;ll also get a TOF sensor and color temperature sensor for more accurate imaging.)</p><p>Honor also said that this IMAX-enhanced camera can be used to shoot your own cinema-quality films, a boast previously used to sell Huawei’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-huawei-s-mate-30-pro-has-quad-camera-array-and-a-vegan-leather-o.html">Mate 30</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-mate-40-123031700.html">Mate 40</a> (told you I’d mention this again). Honor says that, unlike those handsets, it has developed a custom, mobile-friendly version of the filming standard Log, dubbed MagicLog, which is designed to shoot high-quality video.</p><p>Broadly speaking, Log is a way of recording footage that preserves as much of the dynamic range and tone as possible. When viewed straight from the camera, the footage looks weird and it requires a lot of post-processing and grading. In order to save ordinary users from that agony, Honor teamed up with professional colorist <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0572972/">Bryan McMahan</a> to create eight pre-set grades which work like Instagram filters.</p><div id="0e366ea5ff4b4fdf9d144fb18d5f3f92"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXhl9gTxz9Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Honor said that one minute of MagicLog footage will take up around 500MB of memory, so if you want to shoot a film with one of these, invest in one with lots of storage. And this is a feature that we’d love to test in depth in future, because if this in some crazy way does turn out to work, it could be a very big deal.</p><p>Beyond imaging, Honor wanted to talk up the various software engines that it has designed to help squeeze better performance out of the Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-snapdragon-888-plus-under-screen-camera-133605155.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G SoC found in the Pro and Pro+. (The regular Magic3 is using Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon 888.) Long story short, Honor (and Huawei before it) uses an AI layer which has been trained to monitor for challenging processes and adjust power to compensate. It says that, for the Magic3, you can expect to see faster and more stable 5G and gaming performance when using the phone. Then there is OS Turbo X (Apple’s lawyers, I’m sure, will be taking notes) which, it’s claimed, will be able to keep the system running at peak performance for longer. Honor’s representatives said that this system alone will ensure that, after using it for 36 months, you’ll only experience a 3.8 percent drop in performance compared to the day you bought the phone.</p><p>And then there’s “Smart RAM,” which sounds like the sort of RAM-doubling scamware that we saw back in the days of Windows 3.1. Honor’s representatives said that, in times of need, the Magic3 can bounce some of the data from its RAM to the phone’s flash memory. Now it’s not clear if the company is trying to pass virtual memory off as some sort of new-fangled innovation or if there’s some clever new implementation here. Honor says that, no matter if you have the 8GB or 12GB variant, you can expect this system to offer you an additional 2GB of headroom when required. I have no idea if file transfer speeds between the SoC and flash memory are fast enough to make this a viable, boastworthy feature for a new flagship handset.</p><p>The company has also offered some smart privacy features, like obscuring message notifications when you cast video to a TV, as well as the ability to strip metadata from images before you share them to social media.&nbsp;</p><p>Honor hasn’t said how long this device will last on a single charge, but that 4,600mAh battery should have plenty of staying power. All three variants support 66W wired SuperCharge, and you can get up to 50 percent of your battery re-juiced with just 15 minutes of connection. In addition, the Pro and Pro+ models both support 50W wireless charging, should you feel the need.</p><p>Magic3 is available in four colors: Black, White, &quot;Golden Hour&quot; and &quot;Blue Hour,&quot; the latter pair are a pinkish-orangey hue, and a deep royal blue. The standard colors are available in Honor&#39;s usual coating, while the two hours are available in vegan leather. The 3 Pro+, meanwhile, comes in either a ceramic black or white ceramic body with pinstripe texturing which, at first blush, looks extraordinary. All of the handsets are IP68-rated for water and dust resistance, which is about the minimum you can expect from a phone these days.&nbsp;</p><p>The Honor Magic3 series will make its debut in Mainland China, with news about arrivals in western markets coming in short order. CEO George Zhao did, however, reveal pricing for the handset when it reaches Europe, at the very least. The Magic3, with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage, will retail for €899 ($1,054), while the Magic 3 Pro (8GB + 256GB) will set you back €1,099 ($1,289). Flagship-lovers, looking to grab the Magic3 Pro+ with 12GB RAM and 512GB Storage, meanwhile, will have to fork over at least €1,499 ($1,758).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic3-flagship-125020517.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">446c057c-8da6-4714-bf65-4cc096235a6b</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:50:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628772623</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T12:50:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b03162a0-fb64-11eb-8fdf-721d4a0179c6" width="1423" height="731" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor Magic 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor Magic3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard loses three senior designers amid sexual harassment lawsuit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three senior designers pivotal to <em>Diablo 4</em> and <em>World of Warcraft </em>are no longer at Activision Blizzard. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113"><em>Kotaku</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>confirmed the trio of abrupt departures after initially learning about them from internal sources. They include <em>Diablo 4 </em>game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and<em> World of Warcraft </em>designer Jonathan LeCraft. Insiders told the publication that the three developers names had been removed from Blizzard’s internal directory and Slack.&nbsp;</p><p>News of the shakeup arrives as Activision Blizzard is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">grappling</a> with allegations of systemic gender discrimination and sexual harassment. The incendiary accusations, which were revealed in a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), have already led to damaging repercussions for the publisher. Blizzard is facing an internal outcry, with workers staging walkouts and demanding corrective action. Earlier this month, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">lost its president</a> and was hit with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">lawsuit by investors</a> irked by its handling of the crisis. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has admitted that the publisher&#39;s original response to the DFEH filing was &quot;tone-deaf.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the company did not give a specific reason for the latest departures, two of the designers (namely McCree and LeCraft) were reportedly pictured in photos of the infamous &quot;Cosby Suite.&quot; This was the hotel room explicitly mentioned in the DFEH lawsuit where male employees allegedly harassed women at company events. As <em>Overwatch </em>fans may know, the game features a cowboy called Jesse McCree named after the now ex-Blizzard employee. It remains to be seen if the publisher changes the character&#39;s name.</p><p>“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,&quot; a spokesperson for Blizzard told <em>Kotaku</em>. &quot;We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253af6cf-2b1b-405c-b456-5af76d409bce</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 12:19:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628780369</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T14:59:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2e181be0-fb66-11eb-bfeb-82709be393f6" width="5000" height="3305" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook may be forced to sell Giphy following UK regulator findings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK&#39;s competition regulator has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns?=0">found</a> that Facebook&#39;s acquisition of GIF-sharing platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">Giphy</a> will harm competition within social media and digital advertising. As part of its provisional <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6114d39ce90e0705481fbfb8/Facebook_GIPHY_-_Summary_of_Provisional_Findings.pdf">decision</a>, the watchdog voiced concerns that Facebook could prevent rivals including TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy, a service they already use. It added that Facebook could also require customers of the GIF platform to hand over more data in return for access. If its objections are confirmed as part of the ongoing review, the regulator said it could force Facebook to unwind the deal and to sell off Giphy in its entirety.</p><p>The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) ultimately determined that the deal stands to increase Facebook&#39;s sizeable market power. Together, its suite of apps — including Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram — account for 70 percent of social media activity and are accessed at least once a month by 80 percent of internet users, the CMA said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond social media, the watchdog suggested that the acquisition could remove a potential challenger to Facebook in the $5.5 billion display advertising market. Citing Facebook&#39;s termination of Giphy&#39;s paid ad partnerships following the deal, the regulator said the move had effectively stopped the company&#39;s ad expansion (including to additional countries like the UK) in its tracks. This in turn had an impact on innovation in the broader advertising sector, the CMA explained.</p><p>Facebook&#39;s announcement last May that it was acquiring Giphy, with plans to integrate it with Instagram, for a reported $400 million immediately raised <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">alarm bells</a> for regulators. The social network is facing antitrust complaints in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">US</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-facebook-antitrust-probe-105245913.html">EU</a> over its social media and advertising monopolies, respectively. At the same time, the UK has ramped up its scrutiny of Big Tech by creating a dedicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-digital-markets-unit-big-tech-031053255.html">Digital Markets Unit</a> to oversee the likes of Google, Facebook and Apple. The fledgling agency sits within the CMA and is designed to give people more control over their data.</p><p>Today, the CMA echoed those principles in its initial decision. The regulator said that it would &quot;take the necessary actions&quot; to protect users if it concludes that the merger is detrimental to competition. It will now consult on its findings as part of the reviews process. A final decision is slated for October 6th.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson told Engadget<em>&nbsp;</em>that it &quot;disagrees&quot; with the CMA&#39;s preliminary findings. “We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence. As we have demonstrated, this merger is in the best interest of people and businesses in the UK - and around the world - who use GIPHY and our services. We will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”&nbsp;</p><p>It previously argued that Giphy has no operations in the UK, meaning that the CMA has no jurisdiction over the deal. In addition, it has claimed that Giphy&#39;s paid services cannot be classified as display advertising under the regulator&#39;s own market definition.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c68f0768-f104-42a1-8060-3df9ba1fa808</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 11:35:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628769255</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T11:54:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/57ab4ea0-f672-11e9-b8bb-59642a56f54b" width="3000" height="1996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Erin Scott / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies at a House Financial Services Committee hearing in Washington, U.S., October 23, 2019.

The big differences between the two? A rotating bezel and a hundred bucks.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-drops-its-lawsuit-against-a-manufacturer-of-i-phone-emulators-082100357.html">Apple drops its lawsuit against maker of iPhone emulation software</a></h2><h3>The move comes after Apple suffered a major court loss in the dispute.</h3><p></p><p>Apple has settled its 2019 lawsuit with Corellium, a company that builds virtual iOS devices used by security researchers to find bugs in iPhones and other iOS devices.
