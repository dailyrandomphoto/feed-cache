The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036?mod=djemalertNEWS">learned</a> that the Asia Internet Coalition, a tech alliance including Facebook, Google and Twitter, has quietly warned Hong Kong that companies would stop operating in the territory if officials move forward with data protection law amendments that could hold companies liable for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-former-senate-it-worker-pleads-guilty-to-doxxing-senators-on-wik.html">doxxing</a> campaigns.</p><p>The tech giants are worried that staff could face criminal investigations or even charges if users share personal info online, even if they didn&#39;t mean any harm.  That would be a &quot;completely disproportionate and unnecessary response&quot; and could chill free speech, the Coalition wrote. The alliance instead suggested that Hong Kong narrow the scope of violations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hong Kong&#39;s Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data acknowledged the letter&#39;s existence, but said that new measures were needed after doxxing pushed the &quot;limits of morality and the law.&quot; The Commissioner also insisted that the changed laws would &quot;not have any bearing&quot; on freedom of speech, and wouldn&#39;t deter outside investment in the Hong Kong region.</p><p>The amendments could be approved by the end of the legislative year.</p><p>The concern, as you might guess, is that pro-China officials might abuse the updated laws to silence dissent. Pro-democracy activists doxxed police officers and others frequently during the 2019 protests, and there&#39;s a worry that the revised laws could be worded loosely enough that merely sharing a photo of someone in a public space could get both sharers and tech companies in trouble. It could be harder to hold police accountable for violence, or to criticize officials for anti-democratic policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-twitter-may-leave-hong-kong-190015028.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efc886ff-321b-481f-8aa4-c0d3980ac903</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 19:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625492497</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T13:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[d3sign via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bugatti joins forces with electric hypercar maker Rimac]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electric hypercar company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rimac"><ins>Rimac</ins></a> is taking control of Volkswagen’s supercar brand <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/bugatti"><ins>Bugatti</ins></a> as part of a joint venture with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Porsche"><ins>Porsche</ins></a> (which VW owns).

Now, scientists from <a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2021/novel-microscopy-method.html">UT Southwestern</a> have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01175-7">developed</a> a new &quot;simple and cost-effective&quot; device capable of capturing multi-angle photos that can be retrofitted onto existing lab microscopes. The team say their solution — which involves inserting a unit of two rotating mirrors in front of a microscope&#39;s camera — is 100 times faster than converting images from 2D to 3D.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, this process involves collecting hundreds of photos of a specimen that can be uploaded as an image stack into a graphics software program, which then performs computations in order to provide multiple viewing perspectives. Even with a powerful computer, those two steps can be time-consuming. But, using their optical device, the team found they could bypass that method altogether.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s more, they claim their approach is even faster as it requires only one camera exposure instead of the hundreds of camera frames used for entire 3D image stacks. They discovered the technique while de-skewing the images captured by two common light-sheet microscopes. While experimenting with their optical method, they realized that when they used an incorrect amount of de-skew the projected image seemed to rotate.</p><p>&quot;This was the aha! moment,&quot; said Reto Fiolka, assistant professor at the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics at UT Southwestern. &quot;We realized that this could be bigger than just an optical de-skewing method; that the system could work for other kinds of microscopes as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>Using their modified microscope, the team imaged calcium ions carrying signals between nerve cells in a culture dish and looked at the circulatory system of a zebrafish embryo. They also rapidly imaged cancer cells in motion and a beating zebrafish heart. They also applied the optical unit to additional microscopes, including light-sheet and spinning disk confocal microscopy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microscopes-3d-images-cells-170004411.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ceb9ee1e-7839-4a55-838c-3a5d017f7537</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625504888</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T17:08:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW Pics via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Optic microscope with a blood smear sample.

The researchers used a membrane distillation process that resulted in 99.9 percent salt rejection for one month. If commercialized, they say the solution could help alleviate the drinking water crisis exacerbated by climate change. More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/26/more-than-3-billion-people-affected-by-water-shortages-data-shows">3 billion</a> people worldwide are affected by water shortages, with the amount of fresh water available for each person plunging by a fifth over two decades, according to the UN.</p><p>The new study details a way to purify sea water using a a nanofiber membrane as a salt filter. While scientists have used membrane distillation in the past, they kept encountering a massive obstacle that slowed down the process. If the membrane became too wet, or flooded, it could no longer reject the salt. Needless to say, this was a time-draining process that forced scientists to either wait for the membrane to dry or come up with additional solutions, like using pressurized air to release trapped water from its pores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To overcome this challenge, the Korean team turned to a nano technology known as electrospinning to create their three-dimensional membrane. In scientific terms, they used poly vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene as the core and silica aerogel mixed with a low concentration of the polymer as the sheath to produce a composite membrane with a superhydrophobic surface. In essence, this created a filter that had a higher surface roughness and lower thermal conductivity, allowing it to desalinate water for up to 30 days. The full report was published in the <em>Journal of Membrane Science.</em></p><p>“The co-axial electrospun nanofibre membrane has strong potential for the treatment of seawater solutions without suffering from wetting issues and may be appropriate for real-scale membrane distillation applications,” Dr Yunchul Woo, a materials scientist at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, said. He added that the membrane may be appropriate for &quot;pilot-scale and real-scale membrane distillation applications.”&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the main method of purifying sea water is through reverse osmosis at the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html">20,000</a> desalination plants around the world. But these facilities require vast amounts of electricity to operate and also create concentrated <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/desalination-plants-produce-twice-as-much-waste-brine-as-thought">brine</a> as a waste product, which is typically dumped back in the sea. Therefore, it&#39;s no wonder scientists are exploring new solutions that aren&#39;t as counter-productive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nanofiber-membrane-drinking-water-150039679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a14a0633-0280-4cd7-bcef-fe4bb4a7766b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 15:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625481855</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T10:44:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elsevier]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Membrane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[membrane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Intergrade’s entertaining DLC should also be on PS4]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> is a little confusing, if the name didn’t give it away. It’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-120044800.html"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em></a>, remade (or at least polished up) for the PlayStation 5. It also includes new original content called “Intermission.” This is a two-chapter run completely separate to the main game, following the once-optional character Yuffie arriving into <em>Remake</em>’s main setting, Midgar, and bringing her own fight to the evil Shinra corporation. Sadly, you can only play Intermission with a PS5.</p><p>In <em>Remake</em>, each character had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-final-fantasy-7-remake-preview.html">unique playstyle in battle,</a> and that’s still true in Intermission. Yuffie’s battle style switches between long- and close-range fighting. She’ll hurl her oversized shuriken at enemies, and then either close the distance for melee attacks, or launch magical elemental attacks from afar, with the shuriken acting as a sort of lightning rod.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a young, out-of-town ninja, Yuffie also brings a healthy dose of sass and attitude to a game (and characters) that can take everything a little too seriously. The results are often hilarious. When you take on secondary characters from Remake in Fort Condor mini-games, she’ll talk smack to the likes of Jessie, Roach and Kyrie. At points, it’s borderline tone-deaf: Jessie may have just sent her friends, part of anti-Shinra group Avalanche, to their deaths. But from the perspective of Yuffie, she doesn’t know that, and when she crushes the anxious Avalanche member in a board game, the ninja doesn’t hold back.</p><section data-eng-breakout="655ff1edcd8f4a09957e2a3ae03e8ddc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc462110-d991-11eb-beae-355c192c530b" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade"></section><p>Soon into the first chapter, Yuffie is joined by a new character, Sonon. He acts as a close-range tank, distracting enemies from Yuffie who’s more easily damaged. While he’s an uncontrollable support character, and will choose his own movement and enemies to attack, you can still order him to attack with skills or equipped magic from the battle menu.</p><p>This leaves Yuffie able to deal damage safely from a distance; she has the ability to mete out elemental attacks without having to equip the necessary materia (orbs that add magic and skills to characters), able to attack weak points without tinkering much with your loadout. You can also bolster Sonan with materia, making him a more tempting lure to enemies, or just amping up his hit points to ensure he survives more often than not. Sonon also has a convenient resurrection skill that triggers if Yuffie gets KOed, ensuring you’ll center your fight strategies around letting Sonon draw the enemy’s attacks, while Yuffie attacks weaknesses and shoots across the area for enemy crowd control.</p><p>I’m impressed Square Enix was able to eke out yet another completely different fighting style for this DLC chapter — and this bodes well for the subsequent four characters that were party members in the PSOne’s <em>Final Fantasy 7.</em> In the original, barring stats and limit break attacks, characters were blank slates which you loaded out with materia to offer more attack options. In the Remake, they move and attack almost completely differently, demanding different playstyles when you switch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc4e1050-d991-11eb-bf6e-2a028996f9ae" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="074940c7-3c3b-398e-bd5f-2430bb3b1aff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There’s a PS5 version of Remake, too. Given that <em>FF7R</em> was a recent exclusive to the PS4, the changes aren’t groundbreaking but they’re certainly noticeable. I took issue with the grainy land and skyscapes you’d see from the detailed areas in <em>FF7R</em>, and in Intergrade, the resolution has been increased and detail improved. Things that the internet went to town on, like those <a href="https://kotaku.com/ffvii-remake-doors-look-much-better-on-ps5-1847062520">atrociously rendered doors</a>, have been fixed.</p><p>In Intergrade, you can now switch between performance (60fps fixed) and graphics (4K, more graphical flourishes) modes. The former is a revelation during your battles across both the game and the Intermission chapters, as your team fluidly moves around enemies. It feels easier on the eyes and just more satisfying to play. The original <em>Remake</em> (I hate having to write that) didn’t choke too often, but sometimes all the pyrotechnics and detailed boss battles did take its toll on framerates on the fourth-generation PlayStation. There&#39;s also a new photo mode in <em>Intergrade</em>, making it easier to captures some beautiful stills from what is a gorgeous game. I&#39;ve added my favorite shots at the bottom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721311-d991-11eb-bf9d-f253c81ac19d" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="5ecd8276-3aa0-3b2f-b7ff-4a23b50b6511"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There are some other PS5 upgrades, too. Yes, the DualSense’ haptic feedback occasionally kicks in but you’ll rarely notice it. I was only reminded of the difference during the motorcycle chase during the base game, where you can literally feel the texture of parts of your tarmac. Besides that and Cloud’s occasional memory flashes, no other times really stood out where the controller was offering me any extra immersive rumbles. As you might also expect, the loading speeds are also hugely improved: loading your saved game, or hopping between chapters are both incredibly swift.</p><p>One of the big criticisms leveled at Intermission is that these new chapters are playable only on the PlayStation 5 — if you’ve been able to buy one. But do the environments, battles and rambunctious ninjas demand next-gen console hardware?</p><p>Only Square Enix knows for certain, but I don’t think so. The PS4 would have struggled to keep up with Yuffie’s battle style, which sees her shooting across the battlefield after her oversized shuriken. There are other parts, as you navigate levels, that seem to be there expressly to showcase how smoothly the PS5 can handle a ninja hurtling down a mechanized fire pole, with scaffolding, levels and items shooting past — all backed by a five-track jazz arrangement. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-soundtrack-154531230.html">I&#39;m not joking</a>.</p><p>Right at the start of the Intermission chapters, Yuffie gingerly steps through a gap — one of the in-game slow-downs familiar to anyone that’s played <em>Remake</em> on the PS4. This seems to happen only once in the new parts of Midgar introduced in Intermission. It’s almost a knowing nod that things are going to speed up. And they do: the second chapter takes a few darker turns, and at times turns into a gauntlet of punishing battles that are both challenging and entertaining.

The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

These weren&#39;t obscure titles — the malware had over 5.8 million combined downloads and posed as easy-to-find titles like &quot;Horoscope Daily&quot; and &quot;Rubbish Cleaner.&quot;</p><p>The apps tricked users by loading the real Facebook sign-in page, only to load JavaScript from a command and control server to &quot;hijack&quot; credentials and pass them along to the app (and thus the command server). They would also steal cookies from the authorization session. Facebook was the target in each case, but the creators could just have easily steered users toward other internet services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were five malware variants in the mix, but all of them used the same JavaScript code and configuration file formats to swipe information.</p><p>Google told <em>Ars</em> it banned all the app developers from the store, although that might not be much of a deterrent when the perpetrators can likely create new developer accounts.  Google may need to screen for the malware itself to keep the attackers out.</p><p>The question, of course, is how the apps racked up as many downloads as they did before the takedown. Google&#39;s largely automated screening keeps a lot of malware out of the Play Store, but the subtlety of the technique might have helped the rogue apps slip past these defenses and leave victims unaware that their Facebook data fell into the wrong hands. Whatever the cause, it&#39;s safe to say that you should be cautious about downloading utilities from unknown developers no matter how popular they seem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-removes-android-apps-stealing-facebook-passwords-192721252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23ba4161-4838-44bb-bd4f-efe5c75e15f3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 19:27:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625426857</ingested><modified>2021-07-04T19:27:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok's AI is now available to other companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-might-not-sell-tiktok-algorithm-to-us-buyer-184748008.html">TikTok&#39;s AI</a> is no longer a secret — in fact, it&#39;s now on the open market.

The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system that is the first commercial project by Elon Musk’s The Boring Company. The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

The German car maker has <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-recall-24987.html">recalled</a> about 43,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-ev-launch-153020559.html">Taycan Cross Turismo</a> EVs worldwide over a sudden power loss issue. You&#39;ll have to take your electric sports sedan to a workshop to receive an hour-long software update (over-the-air isn&#39;t an option this time), although Porsche said you could continue driving until the update is ready.</p><p>The bug has already been addressed for models rolling off the line, Porsche said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The recall was prompted by an NHTSA investigation of nine incidents where power shut off while the cars were in motion, with six of the cars refusing to restart. <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/07/01/porsche-taycan-recall-power-loss/">noted</a> that Porsche found the problem in 130 cars after conducting its own investigation.

While this isn&#39;t likely to tank sales, it comes as Porsche is still trying to persuade buyers that it&#39;s worth ditching the company&#39;s legendary gas engines for electric motors — it might face some hesitancy after this, even if EVs are likely to be more reliable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-ev-power-loss-recall-official-194259245.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">403f5c47-1372-4293-ac28-b7d6bca9cc69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 19:42:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625341427</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T19:43:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/002fcbe0-dc32-11eb-b7fb-186f20ce24eb" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/002fcbe0-dc32-11eb-b7fb-186f20ce24eb" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan Turbo S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan Turbo S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC charges Broadcom with 'illegally monopolizing' the chip industry]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-broadcom-q4-022356419.html">Broadcom</a> is facing a major antitrust crackdown. <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ftc-charges-broadcom-with-illegal-monopolization-of-the-1847224100">reports</a> that the Federal Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-charges-broadcom-illegal-monopolization-orders-semiconductor">charged</a> Broadcom with &quot;illegally monopolizing&quot; the markets for broadband and TV chips, including WiFi parts. The FTC claimed that Broadcom struck exclusive deals with vendors and service providers that prevented them from buying chips from rival suppliers.</p><p>The FTC also accused Broadcom of obtaining &quot;exclusivity and loyalty commitments&quot; for chip supplies, making it difficult for companies to compete on their own merits. The vote was near unanimous, although newly installed Commissioner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html">Lina Khan</a> bowed out.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Commission&#39;s proposed action would forbid Broadcom from negotiating certain exclusivity and loyalty deals, bar the company from conditioning chip access based on commitments, and ban retaliation against customers who buy from Broadcom&#39;s competitors.</p><p>Broadcom signalled to Engadget that it might cooperate on a settlement.

We wouldn&#39;t expect regulators to make too many concessions as a result, even if a settlement seems likely.

While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation.

The company initially claimed that &quot;fewer than 40&quot; of its customers were directly affected, but security response firm Huntress said three managed service providers it worked with had also succumbed to the attack and compromising over 200 companies.</p><p>The number could be higher. Huntress noted there were eight affected cloud service providers, potentially affecting many more firms. Swedish supermarket chain Coop <a href="https://therecord.media/supermarket-chain-coop-closes-800-stores-following-kaseya-ransomware-attack/">closed</a> almost 800 stores after one of its contractors became a target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kaseya said it had identified the likely source of the security flaw and was developing a patch that would be &quot;tested thoroughly.&quot; In the meantime, though, the company urged all customers to shut down their VSA servers and keep them offline until they could install the update. Software-as-a-service customers were &quot;never at-risk,&quot; Kaseya added, although the company took down that functionality as a precaution.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain who&#39;s behind the attack, although Huntress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial_ransomware_incident_in_progress/">tied the campaign</a> to the Russia-linked REvil group that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbs-ransomware-attack-revil-fbi-121508042.html">attacked beef supplier JBS</a>.</p><p>The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile ransomware attacks, including JBS and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-060635370.html">Colonial Pipeline</a>. It also follows the large-scale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-customer-support-compromised-solarwinds-hackers-033613290.html">SolarWinds breaches</a> attributed to another group, Nobelium. Online security is quickly becoming a major issue in the supply chain, and it&#39;s not clear these problems will disappear any time soon.</p><p>Kaseya&#39;s breach also reflects the dangers of relying heavily on one company&#39;s software platform. While the number of directly affected clients is small, the supply chain network appears to have created a ripple effect that damaged numerous companies down the line. The situation might not improve until there&#39;s either tighter security among Kaseya-like providers or more competition that reduces the potential damage.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d5a7562-7099-4978-b423-0e41fc990409</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 15:57:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625328605</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T16:10:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business Services & Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/68aad870-8811-11ea-aaf9-cf125617cab2" width="4063" height="2674" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/68aad870-8811-11ea-aaf9-cf125617cab2" width="4063" height="2674" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tero Vesalainen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Man installing software in laptop in dark at night.

Unfortunately, you can continue expecting two major Android and three years of security updates if you have a flagship older than the OnePlus 8.</p><p>When the merge was announced, the companies said OnePlus will remain independently operated. Since the move was meant to pool their resources and to better streamline their operations, though, linking their operating systems more closely doesn&#39;t come as surprise.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-oppo-oxygenos-coloros-shared-codebase-141211007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9e6facc-9b34-4c01-85e6-6c2a0b11e26f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 14:12:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625321540</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T14:12:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6f857a10-dbee-11eb-a763-584a15051ee3" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6f857a10-dbee-11eb-a763-584a15051ee3" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cop tried to use a Taylor Swift song to keep protestor video off YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems more and more law enforcement agents are trying to use online platforms&#39; copyright-takedown measures to prevent videos that show them in a bad light <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beverly-hills-police-instagram-copyright-232013882.html">from being shared</a> online.

What’s more, it doesn’t appear there will be an official fix for those who don’t upgrade to a newer storage solution.</p><div id="bc7af78bcb1b42359c3c5b93c1626ec7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsg9YgvGBec?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Earlier in the year, security researchers Radek Domanski and Pedro Ribeiro discovered a series of weaknesses that allow a malicious actor to remotely update a My Cloud OS3 device to add a backdoor. The two say they never heard back from the company when they tried to contact it about the vulnerability. Western Digital attributes its response (or lack thereof) to one of its previous policies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The communication that came our way confirmed the research team involved planned to release details of the vulnerability and asked us to contact them with any questions,” a spokesperson for the company told Krebs. “We didn’t have any questions so we didn’t respond. Since then, we have updated our process and respond to every report in order to avoid any miscommunication like this again.”</p><p>While the flaw isn’t present in Western Digital&#39;s new My Cloud OS 5, it’s unclear if the company ever went back to address it in My Cloud OS3. What’s more, it no longer plans to support the older software. “We will not provide any further security updates to the My Cloud OS3 firmware,” Western Digital says in a <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5">support page</a> dated to March 12th, 2021. “We strongly encourage moving to the My Cloud OS 5 firmware. If your device is not eligible for upgrade to My Cloud OS 5, we recommend that you upgrade to one of our other My Cloud offerings that support My Cloud OS 5.”</p><p>When Engadget reached out to Western Digital, a spokesperson for the company told us &quot;there is a fix for this vulnerability — we &#39;patched&#39; OS3 with OS 5.&quot; They added: &quot;My Cloud OS 5 is a major security release that provides an architectural revamp of our older My Cloud firmware. All My Cloud products currently under active support are eligible for the My Cloud OS 5 upgrade and we recommend that all users upgrade as soon as possible to benefit from the latest security fixes.&quot;</p><p>If you own a device that you can&#39;t update to My Cloud OS 5, you can <a href="https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/Pwn2Own/Tokyo_2020/weekend_destroyer/weekend_destroyer_patch.sh">download a patch</a> Domanski and Ribiro developed. One thing to note is you’ll need to reapply it each time you reboot your device. You can also protect your My Cloud NAS drive by limiting its access to the internet.</p><p><strong>Update 6:35PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Western Digital.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-cloud-os-3-vulnerability-212839292.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2955d51-072f-4475-a356-a7da87f0b971</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 21:28:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625266629</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T22:57:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/114eebd0-db7a-11eb-b77f-541414f7e80e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/114eebd0-db7a-11eb-b77f-541414f7e80e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Western Digital]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Western Digital My Cloud]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Western Digital My Cloud]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird pilots electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals in New York City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Bird is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-three-172619972.html"><ins>electric scooters</ins></a>, it recently expanded into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-e-bike-bikesharing-120007080.html"><ins>bikeshare market</ins></a> and is now also moving into the accessibility space.

Ever since the well-designed and overly powerful 2018 iPad Pro arrived, people have increasingly asked Apple to make its tablet software as flexible and impressive as its hardware. This year’s iPadOS update isn’t going to satisfy those who want the iPad to work more like a Mac — it still feels like an iPad, for better or worse.</p><p>That said, Apple has made a handful of significant changes and a host of smaller ones, all of which add up to an experience that makes the iPad more customizable and flexible than before while still retaining (and improving upon) the basic iPad experience. There are a lot of new features to unpack, and the just-released iPadOS 15 public beta is still a work in progress, but here are some of the most significant changes to look forward to when the final software arrives this fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Should you install iPadOS 15?</h2><h2></h2><p>But first, a note about that beta status. Apple’s public betas are generally pretty reliable, and that’s true here, too. I’ve generally been able to use my 11-inch iPad Pro without any issues, but apps occasionally crash and throw me to the Home Screen; interacting with notifications doesn’t always work; and there are various other hiccups here and there. (Examples: my cursor doesn’t always move to the search field when I summon it, and the last few letters of my messages are sometimes cut off when using the app in Slide Over.) It’s nothing deal-breaking, but it’s noticeable, particularly when I use my iPad for multiple hours at a time. Unless you&#39;re extremely curious, I&#39;d wait for a few more beta versions to be released before giving it a shot, unless you can put it on a back-up iPad.</p><h2>Widgets and Home Screen updates</h2><h2></h2><p>With that out of the way, let’s dig into the new features. The most obvious change in iPadOS 15 is that widgets have come to the Home Screen. As with last year’s iOS 14, iPad users can now pin widgets anywhere they want. You can also select which apps you want to show on the Home Screen and stash the rest in the App Library, an auto-organized place to find everything you’ve installed on your iPad. Both widgets and the App Library came to the iPhone last year, and it was surprising that they didn’t arrive on the iPad until now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3cab510-db63-11eb-bdf3-6f39a88d7f48" style="height:1397;width:2000;" alt="iPadOS 15" data-uuid="20466494-d72b-32fa-acf1-8215f4dcbdb0"><figcaption>My &quot;work&quot; home screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I’m glad Apple did this, because it makes your iPad’s home screens far more customizable than before, something sorely needed on a big-screen device. It took a little work, but I’ve now hidden the apps I don’t use as much in the App Library and now have five home screens curated for work, entertainment, games and so forth. For example, my work screen only has six app shortcuts (Drive, Docs, Sheet, Trello, Slack and LastPass), but the variety of widgets I have installed provides glanceable info and easy access to a lot of tools. I have a widget showing recent notes in the “work” folder, another with Reminders (also specifically from my work group), an Apple News widget showing the latest tech news, and widgets for Google Calendar and Gmail. All that, plus the apps in my dock, make this the prime place to go when I need to get things done.</p><h2>Quick Notes</h2><h2></h2><p>The other new feature that could fundamentally change the iPad experience is Quick Notes. As Apple’s Craig Federighi said during last month&#39;s WWDC keynote, Notes are now a “system-wide” feature. Swiping in from the lower right corner summons a new note that floats above whatever apps you’re using. You can quickly type or write down (with the Apple Pencil) whatever comes to mind and then swipe the note away when you’re done. Depending on your settings, you can start a new note every time you access Quick Notes, or just keep adding to the same one. Finally, you can swipe between Quick Notes you’ve started if you want to get to a specific document.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0f51a1c0-db65-11eb-bda3-ff9dd872800f" style="height:1397;width:2000;" alt="iPadOS 15 Quick Notes" data-uuid="a671b167-3284-3130-91da-940de16944ad"><figcaption>At the top of this Quick Note is a button that automatically appears to let you save a link to the page you&#39;re visiting.</figcaption></figure><p>The iPad’s Slide Over multitasking feature offered an approximation of this experience, but Quick Notes is far more flexible. For starters, you can move a Quick Note anywhere on the screen you want, making it feel like a true “window” reminiscent of something you would use on Windows or macOS. If you’re going to jump in and out of the same note frequently, you can dismiss it to the side of the iPad screen where a little arrow shows that you can summon it back quickly.</p><p>Apple’s Quick Note demos mostly focused on using the Apple Pencil to quickly jot things down, but it works just as well with a keyboard. When I’m doing work, it’s almost always with the Magic Keyboard attached, and being able to quickly summon a persistent document to take notes in, regardless of what else I was doing, makes the iPad feel significantly more versatile. It’s a great tool when doing research, especially since you can add links to web pages in Safari or destinations in Maps with one tap. My only real complaint is that the “swipe in from the bottom right” gesture is a little awkward, especially when using the iPad docked to a keyboard. It’s much with the Apple Pencil.</p><h2>Multitasking</h2><h2></h2><p>Multitasking was a major focus at WWDC, as well. While Apple did make some useful changes here, the fundamental iPad multitasking experience is still the same. Apps can take up the whole screen, or share the display with a second app in Split View. There’s also the Slide Over area, which lets you quickly summon a floating window containing another app. Apple has made major improvements to these features over the years, but they’re the same fundamental multitasking options we’ve had since iOS 9 back in 2015.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6b6425b0-db64-11eb-aff3-fa0a2e2f1151" style="height:779;width:1579;" alt="iPadOS 15 multitasking menu" data-uuid="b90856e1-5353-3a66-b0c6-baf09ed6cf6c"><figcaption>The tiny multitasking menu can be handy, once you know how to use it.</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve been hoping for a true windowed multitasking experience, this isn’t it. But Apple has made it easier to work with the multitasking features it does offer. Now, there’s a tiny three-dot menu at the top of every app you use that lets you move the app between full screen, slide over and split view. As I compose this sentence, I’m typing in the Notes app, full screen. If I want to take Notes into Split View and share the screen with Safari, I just tap the multitasking menu and hit the Split View icon. This gives me a full view of my Home Screen, which then lets me pick anything I want to go alongside Notes.</p><p>Being able to quickly choose from any app on your Home Screen when setting up a multitasking view is a big improvement; before, you primarily had to use search to find the app you want, or drag one of the apps available in your dock. The menu also makes it a lot easier to move apps between Split View, Slide Over and full-screen views. Previously, you had to be aware of a variety of gestures, but a few minutes of playing with the multitasking menu makes the behavior pretty clear.</p><h2><strong>Safari</strong></h2><h2></h2><p>The last major change I’ll cover at this early stage is Safari. It’s one of the most important apps on the iPad, and it’s gotten a lot better in the last few years. But for iPadOS 15, Apple has made what I predict will be a polarizing design decision. In an effort to slim down the top menu bar, Apple crammed the URL bar and open tabs into one row. Essentially, a tab and its URL bar are now represented by a single visual cue.</p><p>This means that the location of the URL bar moves. If you’re looking at the right-most tab you have open, for instance, the URL bar is all the way to the right. It definitely takes some time to get used to, since most of us are used to it always being right in the center of whatever browser we’re using. This also makes it harder to see all your tabs; besides the “active” tab, I can currently see eight others. The rest are hidden off to the left and right of my active tab. To see them, you’ll have to scroll either direction to find what you’re looking for.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dfc5e3c0-db65-11eb-bfd9-e616c611734a" style="height:464;width:2388;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari menu bar" data-uuid="427c2622-b2ed-3e32-8151-bd4ae646b691"><figcaption>Because my active tab is the one furthest to the right, the URL bar in my window is also far to the right.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/327f9020-db66-11eb-8eef-12b4b6d1e73d" style="height:356;width:2388;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari menu bar" data-uuid="dc5c75df-7e55-3d82-bdf7-f2bb52b3572c"><figcaption>In this case, my active tab is to the far left, and so is the URL bar.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s menu bar cleanup also means it removed the button that zooms out to show you a preview of every tab you have open. I used that <em>constantly</em>, so I hate this change. And unlike on the Mac, you can’t customize the Safari menu on the iPad at all. Now, you either have to use a keyboard shortcut or pull up the new sidebar, which contains all the open tabs in a window along with your bookmarks, reading list, history and links shared in Messages.</p><p>Safari on the iPad already did a great job of hiding the menu bar once you started scrolling through a site, so this change feels unnecessary to me. I’ll be curious to see what kind of feedback Apple gets during the beta, because I wager plenty of other people will prefer the old layout.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9a7e55d0-db66-11eb-87ef-b9c8c8e4bb9b" style="height:1327;width:2387;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari sidebar" data-uuid="ae6446bf-c36b-312f-af85-8bde6d30ef7e"><figcaption>Safari&#39;s new sidebar holds your tab groups as well as usual items like bookmarks and your reading list.</figcaption></figure><p>There is at least one good thing about the new Safari: tab groups. They’re handled elegantly, with a button in the sidebar letting you open either a new “blank” group for you to populate or taking all your current tabs and saving them as a group. You can swap between groups in the sidebar, and access any groups you’ve created in any open Safari window you have. Groups will also sync across your other devices, assuming you’ve upgraded to iOS 15 or macOS Monterey. Having different tab groups for different tasks has already proven useful to me, and I’ll probably use them even more as I get used to incorporating them into my workflow.</p><h2>More to come</h2><h2></h2><p>There are plenty of other significant changes to iPadOS 15, things like the new Focus system and notifications revamp, improvements to FaceTime and Messages, the new Universal Control system that works between a Mac, iPhone andiPad, and plenty more. (You can read about some of these changes in our previews of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.) We’ll be doing a proper review of all the new software in its final form this fall, but in the meantime I’m going to keep digging into the future beta releases to see how iPadOS 15 changes between now and its wider release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">577432da-322c-4535-a0c1-734f73e08445</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 19:15:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625253029</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T19:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ebc03e00-db60-11eb-befb-c8eb1b44e3c2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ebc03e00-db60-11eb-befb-c8eb1b44e3c2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPad Pro with iPadOS 15 beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPad Pro with iPadOS 15 beta]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
