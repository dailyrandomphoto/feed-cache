For today only, however, you can pick up a pair for $58, for a very substantial savings of 42 percent.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FjJ9Ay" id="0dc2e3af84c442c98ced2d3eb9f366a6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony WF-C500 earphones">Buy Sony WF-C500 earphones at Amazon - $58</a><p>The WF-C500 sits at the bottom of Sony&#39;s true wireless earphone lineup, but it still has a rich feature set. Comfort is improved over the previous models thanks to a smaller size, IPX4 moisture rating and more secure fit, features borrowed from the high-end WF-1000XM4 model. It also comes with Sony&#39;s Digital Sound Enhancement Engine that restores detail lost when music is compressed over Bluetooth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also supports Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio if you have a supported plan on Amazon Music HD, Tidal HiFi, and others. On-board controls let you manage music, adjust volume, take calls and activate a voice assistant without the need for a phone. It delivers up to 10 hours of listening time on a charge, and a quick charge feature gives you another hour just ten minutes. The main drawback is the lack of active noise-cancellation (ANC) — normal on earphones at this price level.</p><p>If you do want ANC, Sony still has deals on its flagship wireless earphones and headphones. You can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones" href="https://amzn.to/3J5aPLX">WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones</a> with ANC for $248, or $100 off the regular price.

The carriers have reached a deal with infrastructure provider BAI Communications, which is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/london-tube-full-mobile-coverage-104000309.html">building out a network</a> across the Tube as part of a 20-year concession with Transport for London.

This will make a huge difference to passengers, allowing them to make calls, read emails and check travel information while on the move. Investing in London’s connectivity and digital infrastructure is one important way we are helping to stimulate our city’s economy. It also represents a significant step towards ensuring the whole tube network has 5G-ready mobile coverage.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>London&#39;s Underground network has offered WiFi connectivity for almost a decade, but it&#39;s only available to customers of certain carriers on certain platforms. Earlier this year, Transport for London chose BAI Communications to build out a mobile network spanning all stations and tunnels, allowing commuters to check emails, watch videos and do everything else online on 4G or 5G even while they&#39;re inside metal tubes underground.&nbsp;</p><p>BAI has already started building the network at some of London&#39;s busiest stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston and Camden Town. They&#39;ll be the first to allow 4G and 5G connectivity by the end of 2022. City authorities expect the network to be completed and for the whole of London Underground to have mobile coverage by the end of 2024.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/three-ee-london-underground-114010662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d98ddc6f-0660-40b5-8781-0514512972a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640086813</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T11:40:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Travelpix Ltd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground transport system.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's holiday update adds TikTok and 'Sonic' to its infotainment system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s big holiday update for the year has started making its way to the automaker&#39;s fleet of electric vehicles, and it adds quite a large list of improvements and new features. For those addicted to scrolling on TikTok, perhaps the biggest addition is the TikTok app on Tesla Theater. According to the update notes posted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/20/tesla-releases-big-holiday-update-tiktok-app-ui-changes/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, they&#39;ll now be able to scroll the platform&#39;s short-form videos — on repeat, if they want — right on their vehicle&#39;s screen, so long as their car is parked.&nbsp;</p><p>In Toybox, owners will now also find the Light Show feature that Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-25-tesla-model-xmas-show.html">introduced</a> as an Easter Egg on the Model X back in 2015. For the Model X, a choreographed light show includes both flashing lights and opening falcon wing doors, but other models will have to make do with the former. Tesla has made its app launcher customizable, letting owners drag and drop their favorite apps onto the bottom menu bar. It&#39;s also simplifying navigation to make most the common primary controls, such as charging and windshield wipers, easier to access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To automatically see a live camera view of their blind spot when they activate their turn signal, drivers can activate the new &quot;Automatic Blind Spot Camera&quot; option under Autopilot in Controls. Plus, drivers can now edit Waypoints to add stops or to initiate new navigation routes with updated arrival times. The holiday bundle has updates that fit the season, as well, including automatic seat heating that can regulate the front row seat temperatures based on the cabin environment, along with other cold weather improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, drivers can now delete dashcam clips directly from the touchscreen and hide map details to remove distractions if they want. Finally, in the entertainment department, Tesla has added <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>and <em>Sudoku</em> to its Arcade — though we strongly suggest playing any Arcade game only while parked. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that Tesla allowed drivers to play some games in moving cars, a concern that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is discussing with the company. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">told Engadget</a> in a statement: &quot;Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens. We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-holiday-update-tiktok-sonic-110149488.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca97fd9d-c8a1-4c49-b1a6-07f630eb7d41</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640078522</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T09:22:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile says it blocked 21 billion scam calls in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/devices/t-mobile-releases-2021-scam-and-robocall-report">announced</a> that scam call traffic more than doubled in 2021 with attempts hitting an average of 425 million calls every week, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-says-it-blocked-21-billion-scam-calls-this-year/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a> reported.

By 2026, the Environmental Protection Agency will require that automaker fleets travel an average of about 55 miles per gallon, up from the 37 miles per gallon standard they’re held to as of this year.</p><p>The agency estimates the policy will save American drivers between $210 billion and $420 billion through 2050 on fuel costs. Over the life of a model year 2026 vehicle, that will translate to about $1,080 in individual consumer savings after factoring in the higher initial cost of a more efficient vehicle. The EPA estimates the policy will also prevent the release of about 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide over the same time frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We followed the science, we listened to stakeholders, and we are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet – and save families money at the same time,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.</p><p>The new standards effectively mirror those put forward by the Obama administration in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/business/energy-environment/obama-unveils-tighter-fuel-efficiency-standards.html">2012</a>. Had former President Trump not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-03-trump-epa-dot-fuel-emissions-proposal.html">weakened those in 2018</a>, they would have required automakers to make vehicles that could travel about 51 miles per gallon by 2025.</p><p>Jeff Alson, a former EPA senior engineer, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/climate/tailpipe-rules-climate-biden.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the new standards recapture the emissions cuts carved out by the Trump administration. “That’s good, but it’s not going to get us anywhere near the level we’ve got to get to reduce vehicle emissions enough to protect the planet,” he said.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota and Stellantis for comment on today&#39;s rulemaking.&nbsp;</p><p>The new standards mark the most significant climate action taken to date by President Biden. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">As of 2019</a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. However, the announcement comes just one day after Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-bill">would not support</a> the Democratic party’s Build Back Better plan.

The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-drops-warehouse-phone-ban-194434100.html">confirmed over the weekend</a> that it would allow employees to continue using phones.

Where once the two most powerful empires on the planet vied to be first to the moon, we now have corporations led by billionaire barons — Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic — boasting a future filled with exo-planetary tourism. In 2021, the heads of these private companies finally made good on their myriad promises, successfully launching civilians, astronauts and, in two cases, themselves into the uppermost reaches of Earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>SpaceX continues to lead the burgeoning private spaceflight industry from the front. In January, the company successfully launched its first “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-satellite-launch-record-rideshare-program-152051045.html">rideshare mission</a>” aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, ferrying 133 microsatellites into orbit along with 10 of its own Starlink satellites.

The 100-passenger spacecraft, which was designed to help fulfill CEO Elon Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars and, presumably, titling himself  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-game-of-thrones-master-of-coin-142248051.html">God Emperor of the Red Planet</a> (or some such), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-high-altitude-test-flight-232643680.html">spectacularly exploded</a> on the launchpad following a high-altitude test flight in March.</p><div id="7d57befac5f945cd82f6b43dffe7be03"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank.

The company is currently working on a plan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-plan-222943282.html">to launch a Starship prototype into orbit</a>, though no timetable is currently set for that launch — it was originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-155125322.html">slated for July</a> then pushed back to November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/">depending on regulatory approval</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-january-144550856.html">is now set for January</a>.</p><p>But those failed tests have done little to slow SpaceX’s roll over its competition.

They did not, however, impact Virgin Galactic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-vss-imagine-spaceship-3-123030976.html">unveiling of SpaceShip III in March</a>.</p><div id="92173847b5a14771880171a364e50644"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKiLv95mIVo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In May, VG’s perseverance paid off when SpaceShip II <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-completes-rocket-powered-test-flight-172956795.html">successfully completed its rocket-powered test flight</a>, flinging a pair of pilots and a cargo hold full of NASA experiments into the very upper reaches of the atmosphere. The following month, Virgin Galactic received <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-faa-approval-space-113844343.html">approval from the FAA</a> to begin commercial operations, becoming the first such company to secure permission from the aviation industry.

In a subsequent statement from the company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-probe-anomaly-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-092123771.html">Virgin disagreed with the FAA’s characterization</a>.</p><p>“When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters,” the company argued. “Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.” A brief investigation by the FAA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-cleared-to-fly-again-following-faa-investigation-071032837.html">eventually cleared the company to resume test flights</a>.</p><p>Despite these advances in private spaceflight systems, don’t expect the space tourism industry to take off before at least the start of the next decade. If Virgin Galactic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-100-tickets-450000-space-flight-175402247.html">recent price hike from $250,000 to $450,000 per ticket</a> is any indication, very few people will be able to afford such a trip for the foreseeable future.

In 2021, some of us invested in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">smart home devices</a> and others (re)discovered passions for things like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">e-books</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-kanto-yu4-irl-150023872.html">vinyl</a>, but there are plenty of things we bought and loved that didn’t make it onto the site. Here, our staffers look back on the year that was by gushing about their favorite items they bought this year.</p><h2>Dyson V11 Torque vacuum cleaner</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d336c5f0-5d03-11ec-9fbf-4f1ba03a4761" alt="Someone stands while using the Dyson V11 Torque stick vacuum cleaner in their brightly lit living room." data-uuid="91b63469-bb99-3d7e-a389-8e1f0f17ed43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>After a few years of waffling, I finally pulled the trigger in 2021 and bought a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dyson stick vacuum" href="https://fave.co/3Afo1Z9">Dyson stick vacuum</a>. You could say I fell for the hype, but honestly it’s been one of my favorite purchases of the year and arguably the most useful. Until now, we had been relying on a few-years-old Roomba (lovingly named Dale) to clean our two-bedroom apartment — Dale did a good job, but the Dyson is even better. Sure, we have to actually vacuum ourselves, but both my fiancé and I find the task soothing (while our cat finds it absolutely horrific).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hype is real when it comes to the power of Dyson stick vacuums. The V11 Torque sucks up nearly anything and everything in its path, including the masses of cat hair hiding in our carpet. I like how the machine automatically adjusts the suction power when it moves from carpet to hard flooring, and its three modes let you control how powerful it is to begin with. The LCD screen also shows how long the battery will last in each mode, and it’s good enough that I’ve never had to stop cleaning in order to power up. Maybe that will change if and when we move into a larger home, but even then, it’ll be a small price to pay for tidy goodness. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:My vacuum" href="https://qvc.uikc.net/do5AQ7">My vacuum</a> also came with a bunch of attachments, so the machine transforms from a full-sized vac to a handheld with just a few snaps. That lets me clean around my couch and the couch itself — a joy that 29-year-old me might not have appreciated, but one that 30-year-old me relishes in. —<em> Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Sonos Roam</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/e4a2ba60-9eae-11eb-9d7f-ffaefec668fa" alt="Sonos Roam portable speaker outside, standing vertically on a wooden railing." data-uuid="6212097b-c57d-3a99-bee0-8813851e0eb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I bought the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos Roam" href="https://fave.co/3uZmWUl">Sonos Roam</a> with one primary purpose in mind. In Canada, the early stage of the vaccine rollout was delayed compared to how it played out in the US. As a result, most restaurants and bars either weren’t open or operating at full capacity in the late spring and early summer. And so, for the second year in a row, it looked like any hangouts I would have with my friends would be outside. I figured the Sonos Roam would make those more fun, and I was right.</p><p>Everytime I brought it with me to a park hang, my friends would remark how great it sounded. And that’s the best compliment you can give the Roam. It’s small and compact, making it easy to bring with you on any adventure, but more than anything, it sounds way better than any Bluetooth speaker of its size has the right to sound. Because of that, I ended up using the Roam a lot more than I thought I would. It was my constant companion through the summer and fall months, providing a soundtrack when I had to cook dinner, clean my bike or host friends for a patio party. If music is how we decorate time, the Roam did an incredible job of it. <em>– Igor Bonifacic, Associate Editor</em></p><h2>Toro UltraPlus leaf blower and vacuum</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4e8c8a70-59ec-11ec-bf2d-8049d6e2bcfa" alt="Toro UltraPlus leaf blower" data-uuid="8cf91381-05e5-38bb-b677-49daf28e75df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toro</div></figure><p>As I&#39;ve acclimated to the grind of yard work, a part of me feels like I&#39;m transforming into <em>King of the Hill&#39;s</em> propane-selling, tool-loving Hank Hill. That realization struck me pretty hard this fall, as I prepared to brave another onslaught of leaves from the enormous trees around my house. Last year, it typically took me around two hours to rake and bag everything from my tiny front yard. I just couldn&#39;t go through that again. So I decided to buy a leaf mulching vacuum – and it was the best decision I&#39;ve made all year.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Toro UltraPlus" href="https://amzn.to/3DEs7vo">Toro UltraPlus</a> (model 51621) looks like a typical leaf blower, but it does so much more, <em>I tell you what</em>. Its vacuum attachment can suck up an enormous pile of leaves in minutes, and its metal impeller grinds it all up into a fine pulp. Best of all, once its mulching bag is full, I can just unzip it to dump out the contents into a yard waste bag, or directly over a portion of my garden. Thanks to the Toro, I was able to clean my entire front yard in under 30 minutes. Getting that free time back was easily worth $100.</p><p>Like most consumer-grade yard gadgets, the Toro UltraPlus has its share of downsides. Its leaf blowing is hilariously weak – at full blast, it sometimes had trouble moving just a handful of leaves. That&#39;s okay with me, since I also hate the relentless drone of leaf blowers in the suburbs. (And yes, its mulching feature is pretty loud as well, but at least that works quickly.)</p><p>My biggest worry about the UltraPlus is that it&#39;s almost entirely made of plastic. It feels like it’s only a matter of time until the tab that holds in the vacuum tube breaks off. As a plug-in tool, it&#39;s also annoying to juggle a long extension cord while I&#39;m trying to beautify my yard. I can live with that inconvenience, though, as cordless leaf vacuums typically cost over $400.</p><p>Given how much the Toro UltraPlus has changed fall cleanup for me, I’ll probably just buy another if my curent one breaks. And who knows, maybe it’ll last long enough for my daughter to start helping out with yard work. (They make rakes for three-year-olds, right?) <em>– Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Apple Watch Series 7</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed61c5f0-2c26-11ec-bfff-fc22ded728bb" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="1d655e2c-8b3a-3503-8b51-0323f1a2e97f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve been reviewing various generations of the Apple Watch for Engadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-02-the-apple-watch-as-a-fitness-device.html">since the original debuted back in 2015</a>. It was always the same routine: I would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-apple-watch-series-5-review.html">wear the thing for weeks</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html">take it on runs</a> and become obsessed with closing my rings. And then, I’d send my loaner unit back to Apple, and return to life as someone who wore an ugly, not-very-smart watch, or sometimes no watch at all.</p><p>2021 was the first time I felt compelled to buy one for myself. I wish I could say there was something particularly compelling about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">Series 7</a>. But it’s actually a lot like the Series 6, and I knew that when I bought it. No, I got an Apple Watch mostly because I was fed up with my trusty Garmin. It was never pretty – utilitarian at best – but it became decidedly less so when I broke the strap. Yep, I paid $399 for the Apple Watch because I wanted something stylish that would count my steps.</p><p>I’m mostly happy with it. The beige (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:&#x00201c;Starlight&#x00201d;" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">“Starlight”</a>) color scheme goes with everything. I love unlocking my MacBook with the watch instead of being forced to type a long password on Apple’s unreliable Butterfly keyboard. And the automatic workout detection is as precise as I remember it, gently tapping me on the wrist a few minutes into each of my daily walks.</p><p>The biggest issue is my nightly routine of fighting with the watch over how many hours I spent standing throughout the day. The sensor is mercurial and erratic, ignoring the time I spent literally standing at the stove, or even a long series of squats, but sometimes rewarding me for sitting on my butt. Whatever, Apple: I know how long it took me to make that squash for Thanksgiving – and I have photos of the burn marks to prove it. <em>— Dana Wollman, Editor in Chief</em></p><h2>Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91181ac0-59ed-11ec-b71c-12adb0f0592c" alt="Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control" data-uuid="1c876ba0-e9a5-319c-be30-4fe1c863a487"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Durablow</div></figure><p>I live in a quintessential drafty San Francisco apartment. We have central heat, but my partner and I both have allergies and our furnace seems to do a better job at distributing dust around the house than keeping it warm. Which means in the winter months (and, often in the spring and summer too, because San Francisco) we use our gas fireplace to help keep things cozy. We use it so much that we started wishing we could control it from any room in the house. We have smart lights and other devices connected to our Google Home speakers, so why not the fireplace?</p><p>That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Durablow&#x002019;s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote" href="https://amzn.to/3pwopPy">Durablow’s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote</a> comes in. For about $70, the gadget turns any gas fireplace into a smart fireplace. (We use Google Assistant, but it’s also compatible with Alexa and other smart home systems.) The setup itself was fairly painless: it required connecting one set of wires to the gas valve, and downloading an app to pair the receiver with a Google account. Once it’s paired, you can control the fireplace with voice commands from your smart speaker.</p><p>That may sound like a needless amount of effort for something we can also control from a switch on the wall, but after another year spent (mostly) at home, I can safely say rigging Durablow remote control was life changing. Having it connected to our Google Home system means we can turn the fireplace on from any room, which is especially nice in the early mornings when the living room would otherwise be freezing.

And I detest nothing more than feeling my sock slip down into the depths of my sneakers in the middle of a run.</p><p>Ultimately, I caved and decided to give <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bombas&#x002019; running socks" href="https://fave.co/3G2Jp74">Bombas’ running socks</a> a try, and I went with the quarter length because they seemed to be the best option for all kinds of runs. Well, you get what you pay for, folks. These are, without a doubt, the best running socks I’ve ever had — they don’t move around, they don’t slip and they keep my toes fairly warm even during late-November morning runs. They’ve become one of those staples in my wardrobe that are so good precisely because I barely notice them, which is in stark contrast to the cheap socks that always demanded more of my attention than I wanted to give. —<em> V.P.</em></p><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" alt="The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop." data-uuid="5b5e47ab-6e73-3ff6-8d92-29d9a5292fe7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>My first impression of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://bit.ly/3It2Nfq">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> from Astrohaus was one of confusion. I had the feeling that I was looking at a $600 solution searching for a problem. For as much as a modest Windows laptop, the Freewrite combines a small E Ink display with a mechanical keyboard and the ability to sync whatever you write to the cloud. It’s a very simple product that sets out to do one thing well: offer an excellent, distraction-free environment for drafting text. As such, there are no bells and whistles here — it’s minimalism taken to the extreme.</p><p>Under almost any circumstance, this product would make no sense. But, during the pandemic, I got an itch to try my hand at some different writing — fiction, essays, just something different from what I do for work. That’s when the Freewrite started calling me. Despite the high price tag, I became enamored with its beautiful design and imagined using it to bang out words without being distracted by Twitter, the vast expanses of the internet or my colleagues on Slack.</p><p>As expected, no piece of hardware is enough to turn anyone into a novelist. But the Freewrite is a delightful product because of its simplicity. In the era of multi-use gadgets, it’s rare to come across something that focuses on doing one thing exceedingly well. But that’s what the Freewrite does. Its keyboard is a joy to use and the E Ink screen is a smart choice for a device like this. Coming from a laptop it takes a few minutes to get used to the refresh rate, but the basic black-and-white is perfectly suited for text. The Freewrite isn’t for everyone — but if you make a living writing (or are just passionate about it as a hobby), it’s a device worth considering. <em>– Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Nintendo Switch OLED edition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" alt="Samus Aran in a save point" data-uuid="8a9e92ef-6479-3f13-b836-41eff1ff99e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Sure, it’s not the Pro model I hoped for, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:OLED Switch" href="https://amzn.to/3E70qvF">OLED Switch</a> offers the definitive Nintendo experience (for now). This is doubly true if you spend most of your Switch time in handheld mode.</p><p>With a bigger seven-inch, higher-contrast OLED display, all of my games look better on the new Switch, without exception. And I get to play it for longer without charging, despite the same specifications and even battery size. The longer battery life appears to be due to the virtue of a less power-hungry OLED screen, and coming from the original launch model, where I was lucky to eke out 4 hours on games like<em> Super Mario Odyssey </em>or<em> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s a genuine improvement for me, as I love to used to travel with my Switch everywhere. I love the white Joy-Cons, but I’m afraid to wear them out or get them dirty. But that’s my problem.</p><p>Most have said it’s a nice, if inessential, upgrade for existing Switch owners – but if you typically play untethered from a TV, the OLED model is, for me, a substantially better console. Contingent on Omicron’s movements, my OLED Switch will soon have its first test – a long-haul flight to Las Vegas. <em>– Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2>PopSocket MagSafe grip with Smartish phone case</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ec88ce80-59ee-11ec-afe9-0d51f41b5dd9" alt="PopSocket MagSafe Grip" data-uuid="1e24c47a-d0a8-3281-ba39-c94747b8c76d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">PopSocket</div></figure><p>For many years now, I’ve been a big fan of PopSockets, those round plastic extendable discs you stick on the back of your phone. I didn’t really <em>want</em> to like them – I do admit they’re pretty bulky – but they’re surprisingly useful. They make it a lot easier to hold a slim and slippery phone one-handed, plus they do a decent job propping up your phone, too. There’s one major downside though: Reusing them – taking them off and putting them on again – was not something you wanted to do very often, as the gel adhesive gets less sticky over time.</p><p>But this year I got myself the new iPhone 13, which supports MagSafe. Now, instead of a normal PopSocket, I could use the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PopGrip for MagSafe" href="https://amzn.to/3Gzo1a1">PopGrip for MagSafe</a>, which simply attaches magnetically onto the phone. Reusing it is as simple as pulling it off and putting it on again, no need for a sticky adhesive. I still wanted a case for my phone to protect it against the occasional fall, so I made sure to get a MagSafe-compatible one. I ended up choosing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this floral Smartish case" href="https://amzn.to/3oBDbVZ">this floral Smartish case</a> because I liked the look of it. And yes, the PopGrip works fine with it on.</p><p>I know it sounds silly, but I just absolutely love this combination of the Smartish case and the PopGrip MagSafe. The case has a nice texture that makes it feel more secure, and I just love that I can put on and take off the grip as many times as I want without worrying about destroying any adhesive. And I do this more often than you’d think – I usually take it off to power up the phone on my wireless charger, and pop it back on for the rest of the day. I like to joke that this accessory is my number one reason for getting a new iPhone – and not, you know, all the other good things about the phone itself – but honestly, it’s probably not far from the truth. <em>– Nicole Lee, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Wahoo Kickr Smart Bike Trainer and Zwift</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c8a41a60-5cfa-11ec-b7e7-c24283399beb" alt="An in-home setup for Wahoo Kickr Smart and Zwift showing a bike and TV." data-uuid="1ffb370a-8c89-3b22-9ef3-b12553f0480c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I spent the summer of 2020 cycling around my Brooklyn neighborhood most days to keep in shape. But with a long winter looming and growing tired of the chaos in the streets, I decided to pony-up some cash for a home fitness solution. After much deliberation, I settled on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Wahoo Kickr Smart" href="https://fave.co/3oGcI9O">Wahoo Kickr Smart</a> bike trainer. It’s one of the pricier models at $1,200, but its folding legs, subtle tilt range, low noise output and top specs seemed future-proof. Paired with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Zwift" href="https://fave.co/3ydg8Us">Zwift</a>, a massively multiplayer online cycling and running app ($16/month), I now had the biking sim I’d always wanted and an exercise setup that’s season agnostic.</p><p>The Kickr Smart is relatively compact with a handle and folding legs for stowing away during downtime. It’s direct-drive for use <em>with</em> your bike instead of being a space-hogging standalone device. You remove your back wheel, lock into place and use the unit&#39;s own (upgradable) gear cassette so you’ll be able to shift gears normally. This allows for quick release, so you can still ride your bike outdoors on a whim, although my road bike has been in position for a while now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/196910c0-5cfd-11ec-8ffd-fe53e6c440c3" alt="A screenshot from the cycling sim Zwift showing the Neokyo city environment." data-uuid="7fecfadd-d0b3-36cb-acdb-c8a085d54f88"><figcaption>An in-game POV screenshot from Zwift&#39;s Makuri Islands: Neokyo expansion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I run Zwift on an Apple TV, which connects to the Kickr Smart via Bluetooth and includes power, cadence and speed tracking. I set up in front of a flatscreen for full POV immersion in one of the various virtual worlds offered, including the new <a href="https://www.zwift.com/neokyo">Neokyo cityscape</a>. I also have a fan (it’s a sweat fest) and a table for water, snacks and my phone since I use the Zwift <a href="https://www.zwift.com/companion">companion app</a> for features not readily accessible on the Apple TV. The experience is a combination of fitness and gaming in a form factor that closely enough resembles outdoor riding.</p><p>The Kickr Smart trainer adjusts resistance to simulate terrain from flat to climbs and downhill. There are tons of gamified features, long-term goals and you’re virtually alongside riders from around the world. You can set structured workouts and join races, but I’m just there to ride and only interact with others on occasion to give “ride ons” — a sort of thumbs up.</p><p>I’ve gone from eight miles during my lunch break to waiting until the evening to fit in fifteen or more, which seems like the minimum these days. My goal wasn’t really to train, but it’s been compelling enough that I&#39;ve steadily increased my distances and climbs.</p><p>I’ve been riding year-round, about five days a week and I have to say it’s (a lot of) money well-spent, both for fitness and mental health. There are no spin-class tyrants shouting at you, just some gamified nudges and your own desire to ride. <em>– Jon Turi, Homepage Editor</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-our-favorite-gadgets-of-2021-irl-140052965.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">adb1eddb-cf3d-4fc1-9eb6-05dc40f8a9c7</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640027973</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T19:19:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Freewrite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG's first gaming laptop comes with an NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU and 11th-gen Intel CPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is best known for productivity-oriented laptops and particularly, its lightweight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html">Gram 17</a> — but not any serious gaming models.

To start with, the Standard Range model, with a projected 230 miles of range, will come with a 98 kWh battery pack. Meanwhile, the optional Extended Range version (300 miles targeted) will have a massive 131 kWh battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The Standard Range package will be the main offering on the first three of four versions: the fleet-oriented Lightning Pro, the XLT and the Lariat. The Extended Range is optional for the XLT and Lariat, and standard on the top-end Platinum model. Ford said that the &quot;F-150 Lighting Pro model will be available with the standard-range battery to retail customers,&quot; but it <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">previously said</a> that it would be available with the Extended Range option for fleet buyers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford also revealed that the power fold mirrors would only be available on the Lariat and Platinum models, and that the Tough Bed spray-in bed liner is not standard, but an available option on all trims. Other options we already knew about include a high-powered 9.6 kW Pro Power system for the first two trims (it&#39;s standard on Lariat and Platinum) and 15.5-inch touchscreen with Sync 4A, available on the upper trim levels.</p><p>Ford has yet to reveal exact retail prices, but it previously said that the Standard Range Lightning Pro will start at $39,974 before any tax incentives for commercial buyers, while the Extended Range model (again only for fleet buyers) will start at $49,974. Retail prices are expected to start at $42,000 and top out at $90,000 for the Platinum model. That&#39;s a fair bit higher than the $28,000 base price for an F-150 ICE version, but then again, most folks pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/reviews/pricing-your-next-ford-f-150-it-could-cost-60000-or-more/">considerably more than that</a> on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the large battery sizes, Ford&#39;s prices actually seem surprisingly reasonable. By comparison, Hyundai&#39;s <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/kona-electric">Kona Electric</a> has a much smaller 64 kWh battery and starts at $34,000. We should know the exact F-150 Lightning prices soon, as Ford said in the livestream that order banks would open in January 2022. Currently, it has 200,000 pre-orders in hand, and recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html">cut off</a> further reservations.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-98-kwh-131-kwh-batteries-092329022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1cc737b-5811-466d-b529-42da19288e19</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:23:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639992736</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T09:32:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malaysia's updated copyright law imprisons streaming pirates for up to 20 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Illegal streaming could be particularly costly in Malaysia. <em>TorrentFreak</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/malaysia-passes-bill-to-imprison-illegal-streaming-pirates-for-up-to-20-years-211218/">reports</a> the country has passed <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Parlimen-CopyrightAct1987-ammendment-dec21-01.pdf">amendments</a> to its Copyright Act that punish those who enable pirate streaming. People who offer streaming services and devices that &quot;prejudicially&quot; hurt copyright owners can face fines equivalent to $2,377 or more, prison sentences up to 20 years, or both.</p><p>The updated law also discourages companies from either participating in streaming piracy or tolerating its presence.

The two have <a href="https://twitter.com/youtubetv/status/1472657141789904899?s=21">struck</a> a deal that restores access to ESPN, FX and other Disney channels on YouTube&#39;s streaming service. Local ABC stations will come back over the course of the day (December 19th), but you may already see access to any recordings of Disney-owned channels.</p><p>The base subscription rate is returning to $65 per month, but YouTube TV promised that &quot;all impacted members&quot; would still receive a one-off $15 discount. More details would be coming through email, the service said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney channels vanished on December 18th after the media giant and YouTube TV failed to reach an agreement on channel carriage fees. As is often the case with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html">disputes like this</a>, each side blamed the other. Disney claimed YouTube TV &quot;declined to reach a fair deal,&quot; while YouTube maintained that it was advocating on &quot;behalf&quot; of viewers.</p><p>This isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s only row over carriage deals. The service has traded blows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-tv-nbc-universal-dispute-resolved-200510827.html">NBCUniversal</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-yes-network.html">Sinclair</a>, for instance. With that said, the Disney fight may have been one of its most important. It&#39;s not just that channels like ESPN remain a major draw for live TV services — it&#39;s that Disney could easily have siphoned some of those customers to its equivalent Hulu offering. YouTube may have decided that any increased costs (and possible rate hikes) were less painful than losing viewership.</p><div id="4f9cc4bef1df4c4782032a1364a55c90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re happy to announce that we&#39;ve reached a deal with Disney and have already started to restore access to channels like ESPN and FX, and Disney recordings that were previously in your Library.

The principal investigator for NASA&#39;s Juno mission, Scott Bolton, has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">produced</a> an audio recording of magnetic field activity around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede</a> as the Juno spacecraft flew past on June 7th, 2021. The 50-second clip reveals a sharp change in activity as the probe entered a different part of Ganymede&#39;s magnetosphere, possibly as it left the night side to enter the daylight.</p><p>The audio came from shifting electric and magnetic frequencies into the audible range. Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere dominates that of its moons and is present in the recording, but Ganymede is the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetic field (likely due to its liquid iron core). This isn&#39;t a feat you could replicate elsewhere in the near future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The soundtrack was part of a larger Juno briefing where the mission team revealed the most detailed map yet of Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field. The data showed how long it would take the Great Red Spot and the equatorial Great Blue Spot to move around the planet (roughly 4.5 years and 350 years respectively). The findings also showed that east-west jetstreams are ripping the Great Blue Spot apart, and that polar cyclones behave much like ocean vortices on Earth.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t hear these sounds if you could visit Ganymede yourself. However, they&#39;re a reminder that even seemingly dead worlds are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-nasa-mars-quake-sounds.html">brimming with activity</a> you can detect using the right instruments. It&#39;s just a question of how easy it is to notice that activity.</p><div id="6f2172424c314e4daf7a18c31bff8ae3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_09R6jIo74U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jupiter-moon-ganymede-sounds-juno-probe-163306580.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30b4543c-005d-4e19-a384-e2d33b6ab7ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 19 Dec 2021 16:33:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640008078</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T13:57:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76adbbb0-60e4-11ec-8ddf-a47056e747e6" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76adbbb0-60e4-11ec-8ddf-a47056e747e6" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/JPL-Caltech/SwRI/MSSS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jupiter's moon Ganymede photographed by NASA's Juno probe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jupiter's moon Ganymede photographed by NASA's Juno probe]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla provides free off-peak Supercharger use during the holidays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla owners are already grappling with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-50-percent-discount-overnight-supercharger-california-105311918.html">overcrowded Supercharger stations</a> at times, and the company is taking extra steps to minimize those long lines during the Christmas travel period. <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/18/tesla-offers-free-supercharging-off-peak-hours-holidays-help-curb-traffic/">According</a> to <em>Electrek</em>, Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/holiday-supercharging?redirect=no">has made</a> Supercharging free at some stations during off-peak hours (7PM to 10AM local time) between December 23rd and December 26th.

It starts at RMB 328,000 (about $51,450), or well under the roughly $70,000 of the ET7, but offers similarly grandiose range figures. Nio claims the base 75kWh battery offers over 341 miles of range using China&#39;s test cycle, while the highest-end 150kWh &quot;Ultralong Range&quot; pack is supposedly good for more than 620 miles. You&#39;ll likely pay significantly more for the privilege and may not see that range in real life, but the numbers could still tempt you away from higher-end Model 3s if long-distance driving is crucial.</p><p>You can expect the usual heapings of technology.

The brand only expanded to Norway in 2021, but it aimed to begin sales in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2022. You should see the badge in 25 countries and regions by 2025.

The automaker told <em>Roadshow</em> in a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-remote-start-digital-pay-subscription/">statement</a> that remote starting won&#39;t be available on key fobs for new vehicles. You&#39;ll have to use the brand&#39;s mobile app, in other words. With that said, you might not mind the cost.</p><p>You may not ever have to pay for the feature. While it was previously clear 2018 to 2020 vehicles were limited to a three-year Connected Sevices trial, some 2020 model year and newer vehicles include a 10-year trial. There&#39;s a real possibility you&#39;ll have moved on to another car by the time the freebie expires.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This still won&#39;t please anyone who prefers the simplicity of a fob, or owners who intend to keep their vehicles for a long time. You may have to pay extra just to keep the functionality your car had for a large part of its lifespan. We wouldn&#39;t count on Toyota backtracking, mind you. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-q3-20">many companies</a>, Toyota is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-05-toyota-kinto-car-subscription.html">turning to services</a> to provide a steadier revenue stream than it would get through sales alone. Remote starting isn&#39;t likely to represent a windfall when it will only collect $80 per year a decade from now, but it hints where Toyota&#39;s strategy is going.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-no-key-fob-remote-start-on-new-cars-174544070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df61436f-a672-432c-8780-8b222a663932</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:45:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639849549</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T17:46:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b8b7cdc0-6026-11ec-9dee-7d08e6655956" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b8b7cdc0-6026-11ec-9dee-7d08e6655956" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota 2021 RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota 2021 RAV4 Prime plug-in hybrid SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We listen to Yamaha’s latest headphones with 3D sound]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we get closer and closer to the end of the year, there are still plenty of interesting gadgets, instruments and devices to review. This week, we’ve got a new addition to the <em>Halo </em>series with <em>Halo: Infinite, </em>which Jessica Conditt says fits right in with the rest of the franchise. Terrence O’Brien played the Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster and reported that the hybrid instrument produces convincing acoustic sounds that echo the original guitar. James Trew used the Analogue Pocket and says it’s the best handheld retro experience available right now, period. And Billy Steele listened to Yahama’s YH-L700A, which he deemed a bit heavy-handed, albeit excellent for movie watching.</p><h2>The Yamaha YH-L700A headphones have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-review-130056716.html">a unique aesthetic and a high price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A review" data-uuid="a74a6e50-f9ad-3c8b-95a6-9bffa0a47b49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the look of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3F6mW96">Yamaha YH-L700A</a> headphones: he says the combination of leather, fabric, matte black and silver accents makes for a refined look while the square fold-in ear cups make them easy to travel with. The noteworthy feature on these headphones is the 3D Sound Field feature, which consists of seven presets to enhance music and movies. There’s also a head-tracking feature which makes the sound appear to be coming from a stationary point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Billy says this last feature added a cinematic element to movie watching, but he didn’t think it translated when listening to music. The seven presets of the 3D Sound Field likewise worked better for movies and television where they created a spacious sound. While testing the filters with music, Billy reports they felt  heavy-handed and didn’t work well across genres. He says the active noise cancellation on these cans is sufficient if not impressive, and points out that the marquee features can be toggled on and off within the app. However, he was disappointed with the battery life – during testing, the headphones managed to last just under 11 hours, which is lackluster when most of the competition boasts closer to 30 hours of battery life. And at $500, they have a high price tag to boot.</p><h2>The Analogue Pocket offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html">all the fun of ‘90s portable gaming</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5fc6b9e0-5f7e-11ec-bccb-885439fe0e1d" alt="Analogue Pocket" data-uuid="ecd007be-d945-3497-90d7-0621f0a9cee2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew/Engadget</div></figure><p>James Trew is a long-time vintage gaming fan and is quick to point out that while the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> is the best experience available right now, it’s also not for casual users. At $220, it lets you play most vintage portable titles from Game Boy, as well as Game Gear, while adapters for Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx are on the way. It also has more modern touches, too, like a backlit display. And in addition to being a quality gaming device, the Analogue Pocket can also hook up to a TV and has built-in music making software.</p><p>Because of its FPGA “cores,” the Pocket can mimic vintage consoles at a hardware level – no more emulator quirks to suffer through. It’s also functional with original Game Boy accessories like the Game Boy Camera, printers or rumble packs. And it can connect to an authentic Game Boy for a multiplayer experience. James liked the 3.5-inch screen made with Gorilla Glass as well as the save states, but wished the shoulder buttons were better and said some of the display modes obscure on-screen messaging at times. Overall, the Analogue Pocket offers elevated retro gameplay with enough forthcoming additional features to ensure it will get better over time.</p><h2><em>Halo: Infinite </em>has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">fun new mechanics and tools</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e4d2060-5f7e-11ec-8625-35a59187b28e" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="ffbcc3f9-0632-3493-80a5-cfc635241b40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Jessica Conditt had high hopes for <a href="https://amzn.to/3sgVF0k"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a><em>, </em>the first open-world game in the franchise’s history. And she admits that playing the new storyline brought back warm, gleeful feelings and a sense of familiarity. However, she also thinks the game lacks surprise and intrigue – much of the innovation into vertical space has been done by other, more recent games, and the cramped map made for contained and linear gameplay.</p><p>That being said, Jessica reports she had a lot of fun playing with the newly available mechanics and tools, in particular the grapple hook. From climbing mountains to scaling buildings, the grapple hook provides new vertical space for players to explore. Jessica says that while she expected a lot more from the pioneer FPS title, she also thinks it’s at its best when it gives users a rich environment full of grappling, shielding and in-air headshots. From the maze-like levels, military stereotypes and sarcastic robots, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game.</p><h2>The Hydrasynth Explorer offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html">an endless array of synth options</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c5da5160-5f7e-11ec-af4f-5fa3df46f039" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="5e6b7073-336d-3036-be27-904697348370"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits up front that the <a href="https://fave.co/3GPVgG7">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> offers a remarkable array of features and options in a portable, well-built device. For $600, you get a wavemorphing engine with an eight-note polyphone, three oscillators per voice, a ring modulator, a noise source and over 200 waveforms. There are also two filters which can be in series or parallel to determine how much of each oscillator goes to each filter. He says that the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface of what the synth is capable of.</p><p>However, you don’t need to master the sound design tools to get started with the instrument – just dig into the 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. During testing, Terrence found the Explorer easy to use thanks to the neatly labeled sections on the front panel. A few things missing on the versatile device are a proper sequencer, full-sized keys, and touch strips instead of pitch and mod wheels. There are also only three filter knobs instead of five. Despite that, Terrence still feels that the Explorer is well worth its price tag given its great sound, solid build and plethora of tools to explore.</p><h2>Fender’s Acoustasonic Player Telecaster is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-hybrid-guitar-hands-on-183045383.html">an (almost) perfect couch guitar</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7a4bf50-5f7e-11ec-8ffd-c0f7b9b11aad" alt="Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster" data-uuid="bd87987e-c5b9-3ff0-bde3-4660d3b7cf47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien also spent some time with the new <a href="https://fave.co/323YExL">Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster</a>, which slashes $800 off the price of the previous model. For $1,200, you get a mahogany and spruce satin finish with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups and a three-way switch with six sound options. Instead of a rechargeable battery, the Player runs on a standard nine-volt cell. Terrence reports it eats through the batteries surprisingly quickly, but remains convenient.</p><p>When it came to how the instrument sounded, Terrence reports that while there are fewer acoustic simulations on this model, the two offerings (Rosewood Dreadnought and Mahogany Small Body) cover a lot of ground. He says that he prefers the electric sounds of the Telecaster to the more expensive <a href="https://fave.co/32arOvl">Jazzmaster</a>, as it resembles the original guitar more and plays better with pedals. Terrence says the two acoustic simulations offer depth and character, and that overall, the hybrid guitar is a perfect couch instrument.</p><h2>Universal’s Audio Volt is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html">an audio interface ideal for a home studio</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/27d4b720-5f7f-11ec-bbef-3371e2aa6829" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="a4a21376-8a82-3c72-ac4a-0969366eb12c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien deems Universal Audio’s first foray into the budget space a success. The company’s <a href="https://fave.co/3q3MTQt">Volt series</a>, five models that run from $139 to $369, are affordable audio interfaces that share a core 24-bit/192kHz audio converter and a preamp with a “Vintage” mode that aims to recreate that classic tube preamp sounds. Terrence tested the $189 Volt 2 and the $299 Volt 276, which are both two-input interfaces.</p><p>The differences between the two models are slight: the Volt 2 is simple and utilitarian, but works well with limited space, while the “76” version has a built-in compressor and will require extra desk space as most of the controls are on the top. Terrence says the compressor makes a big difference as it’s capable of softer edges to tame the harsher frequencies. He also felt the metering LEDs on the 276 were easier to see and the wooden sides were a nice touch. While the base models were excellent interfaces at reasonable prices, Terrence said the 176, 276 and 476 stood out from the pack thanks to their compressors, style and ergonomics.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-listen-to-yamahas-latest-headphones-with-3d-sound-170015087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60360933-ebcd-452d-881b-41b2e81f5631</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639783892</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T23:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We listen to Yamaha’s latest headphones with 3D sound]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
