New York resident Alejandro Vivar <a href="https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1455512/apple-sued-for-fraud-over-headphone-charging-capacity">has filed</a> a potential class action lawsuit over allegations <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-beats-powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> design defects prevents the wireless earbuds from charging properly. As it&#39;s reportedly too easy to lose contact between the buds and their charging case, one of the earpieces either won&#39;t charge &quot;consistently&quot; or quickly drain its charge. Apple committed fraud by misrepresenting battery life and failing to address issues it supposedly knew about, the plaintiff said.</p><p>Vivar&#39;s attorneys suggest a combination of the case design and an insufficiently sturdy ear &quot;gasket&quot; (the piece that goes into your ear) may be responsible. Customers have had to resort to inserting a &quot;wedge&quot; to keep the charging pins in contact, according to the lawsuit. The lawyers also reject Apple&#39;s claims the Powerbeats Pro are sweat- and water-resistant, arguing that sweat corrodes the charging contacts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit calls for Apple to &quot;correct&quot; the situation, compensate affected users and pay unspecified damages. If the lawsuit is fully certified as a class action, it would cover both New York customers as well as those in Georgia, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Virginia.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. As with many such lawsuits, there&#39;s no certainty it will reach class action status or lead to compensation. And don&#39;t expect a windfall even if the case succeeds — with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-12-google-pixel-settlement-available.html">some exceptions</a>, class actions tend to result in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-05-playstation-vita-settlement-credit.html">small payouts</a>. If anything, the lawsuit may do more to affect design choices than Powerbeats Pro buyers&#39; bank accounts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-powerbeats-pro-class-action-lawsuit-221509629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">665872d2-3962-4284-8ba2-4dfa36823b58</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 22:15:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642284913</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T22:15:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/886ca8d0-764b-11ec-99dc-f971c8762f6b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/886ca8d0-764b-11ec-99dc-f971c8762f6b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Powerbeats Pro and charging case]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Powerbeats Pro and charging case]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Face mask sensor can detect leaks and your heart rate]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might not be thrilled that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-reneges-on-zephyr-n95-claims-201857955.html">face masks</a> are a part of daily life during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they could soon be useful for more than protecting others and yourself. Researchers at Northwestern University (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engage-game-boy-211023869.html">battery-free Game Boy</a> creator Josiah Hester) have <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/01/fitbit-for-the-face-can-turn-any-face-mask-into-smart-monitoring-device/">developed</a> a &quot;FaceBit&quot; face mask sensor that can track a wide range of health data from inside an N95 mask. The magnetically-attached unit can gauge your heart rate using the subtle head movements from blood pumping, and can detect leaks or a poor fit by looking for sudden dips in mask resistance.</p><p>Those measurements, in turn, can help the sensor detect a slew of other conditions. Heart and breathing data could let you know when you&#39;re stressed and need a break. And while the sensor won&#39;t replace an N95 fit test (to verify a proper seal), it&#39;s capable enough to help you maintain that fit over the course of a long day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You might not have to charge the sensor, either. While there is a battery in the prototype, the sensor uses breathing force, heat, motion and the Sun to extend the mask&#39;s longevity to 11 days. Hester eventually wants the mask to be battery-free.</p><p>FaceBit will need to go through clinical trials and other tests before it&#39;s ready for real-world use. However, Hester&#39;s team has already <a href="https://facebit.health/">released the project</a> code and hardware to the public to help others build and verify it.  While you probably won&#39;t buy one of these for personal use, it could be crucial for hospitals eager to keep workers safe and prevent burnout over long shifts.</p><div id="24e5ecf3cc234d6b8c743235c72cf70e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zENpI85PDA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebit-smart-face-mask-sensor-205238551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5048bf1-a45e-4dbb-98c4-bee1b2ae6cd2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642280237</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T20:57:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Northwestern University]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mac and Linux games leave Humble Bundle’s Trove after January 31st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re on Humble Bundle and use a Mac or a Linux computer, you may want to download all the games you can from the service&#39;s Trove before the month ends. Starting on February 1st, the Mac and Linux versions of the games in the Humble Trove will no longer available. The Humble Trove is a catalog of over 70 DRM-free games that you can access, so long as you have a Choice subscription. A few days ago, Humble <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humble-choice-subscription-change-214917516.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s simplifying its subscription service by offering a single $12 monthly plan that gives you permanent copies of all the games for that month.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to getting access to Trove, you&#39;ll also also be able to play the Humble Games Collection with a more modern collection of titles starting in February if you subscribe. To be able to access the games in the Humble Trove and Collection, though, you will have to download the service&#39;s new app. That new app is Windows only, leaving you out completely in case you&#39;re a Mac or Linux user. Humble has already started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/s2iqka/if_youre_not_on_windows_bye_bye_trove/">sending users an email</a>, reminding them that they only have until January 31st to download games if they&#39;re not on Windows.

The proposed hardware would disrupt the tracking on heat-seeking missiles by steering infrared laser energy toward the oncoming projectiles.</p><p>The courier service pointed to &quot;several&quot; foreign incidents where attackers used portable air defense systems against civilian aircraft. While there weren&#39;t specific examples, <em>NBC</em> pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019.

Some American commercial aircraft have used anti-missile systems as early as 2008, and FedEx helped trial a Northrop Grumman countermeasure system  around the same time. Israel&#39;s El Al has used anti-missile systems since 2004. FedEx&#39;s plans would be significant, though, and rare for a courier company. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if more commercial aircraft followed suit, even if the risks of attacks remain relatively low.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fed-ex-anti-missile-laser-proposal-182159427.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e4bde63-9b4a-45e2-88cd-266b38319caa</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 18:21:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642270920</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T18:22:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f470d7b0-762b-11ec-bfff-29d880a5f2b8" width="5040" height="3360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f470d7b0-762b-11ec-bfff-29d880a5f2b8" width="5040" height="3360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[viper-zero via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chiba, Japan - May 18, 2019:FedEx Boeing B767-300F (N104FE) freighter.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FedEx Boeing B767-300F (N104FE) freighter.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next iPad Pro will reportedly offer MagSafe charging and a 'brand new chip']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The murmurs of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-bloomberg-report-080021362.html">iPad Pro with wireless charging</a> are growing louder. <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/14/apple-hits-roadblock-in-plans-to-redesign-ipad-pro-with-magsafe/">sources</a> claim Apple is moving forward with an update to its pro tablet that would include MagSafe wireless charging, but not necessarily how you&#39;d expect. Rather than using a previously reported all-glass back (like most recent iPhones), the new iPad Pro could instead charge through an enlarged glass Apple logo built into a metal back. It would charge more quickly than an iPhone (expected given the iPad&#39;s added power draw) and carry stronger magnets to keep the charger in place.</p><p>The refreshed iPad Pro would include some more universal improvements, including a larger battery and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>-style camera array. There would also be a &quot;brand new chip&quot; <em>9to5</em> presumed would be the M2 also expected for a new MacBook Air. Earlier rumors suggested the M2 would have eight cores like the M1, but would run them faster and tout more graphics cores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There was no mention of a specific timeframe for the iPad Pro update. While talk has circulated of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html">spring event</a>, there are no guarantees Apple will launch any new iPads in that time frame. Don&#39;t be shocked if there is a new Pro, though. The M1-based iPad Pro was as much a chance for Apple to flex its silicon prowess as it was a functional upgrade — an M2 sequel would keep that momentum going, and MagSafe support would help tie the Pro into Apple&#39;s wider ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-magsafe-leak-173643522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a8ec807-adc5-41b9-8444-3af4fea44951</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 17:36:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642268204</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T17:36:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2e65990-7624-11ec-b8ad-8965dccf581b" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2e65990-7624-11ec-b8ad-8965dccf581b" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro with M1 (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro with M1 (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: The first man to listen to the birth of stars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If the efforts of the 10,000-plus people who developed and assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-10-billion-james-webb-space-telescope-will-study-universe-origins-180049573.html">the James Webb Space Telescope</a> are any indication, the age of the independent scientist are well and truly over.

With hindsight, we can see that astronomy was about to be turned upside down by a revolution at least as big as the one started by Galileo’s telescope. Detecting radio waves from space marks the first time in history that humanity glimpsed the vast invisible Universe, hiding beyond the narrow window of the visible spectrum. It was a momentous occasion that was all but ignored in academic astronomy circles for one very simple reason: the world of radio engineering was just too far removed from the world of astronomy. When Jansky published his initial results he attempted to bridge the divide, spending half the paper giving his readers a crash-course in astronomy (explaining how to measure the location of things in the sky, and exactly why a signal repeating every twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes meant something interesting). But, ultimately, the two disciplines suffered from a failure to communicate. The engineers spoke a language of vacuum tubes, amplifiers and antenna voltages: incomprehensible to the scientists more used to speaking of stars, galaxies and planets. As Princeton astronomer Melvin Skellett later put it:</p><blockquote><p>The astronomers said ‘Gee that’s interesting – you mean there’s radio stuff coming from the stars?’ I said, ‘Well, that’s what it looks like’. ‘Very interesting.’ And that’s all they had to say about it. Anything from Bell Labs they had to believe, but they didn’t see any use for it or any reason to investigate further. It was so far from the way they thought of astronomy that there was no real interest.</p></blockquote><p>After Jansky had moved on to other problems, there was only one person who became interested in listening to radio waves from space. For around a decade, from the mid-1930s until the mid-1940s, Grote Reber was the only radio astronomer in the world.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grote_Reber">Grote Reber’s</a> story is unique in all of twentieth-century science. He single-handedly developed an entire field of science, taking on the task of building equipment, conducting observations, and exploring the theory behind his discoveries. What makes him unique is that he did all of this as a complete amateur, working alone outside the scientific establishment. His job, designing electric equipment for radio broadcasts, had given him the skills to build his telescope. His fascination with the scientific literature brought him into contact with Jansky’s discovery of cosmic static, and when it became clear that no one else in the world seemed to care very much, he took it upon himself to invent the field of radio astronomy. He built his telescope in his Chicago back garden using equipment and materials available to anyone. His telescope, nearly ten metres across, was the talk of his neighbourhood (for good reason – it looks a bit like a cartoon doomsday device). His mother used it to dry her washing.</p><p>He spent years scanning the sky with his homemade machine. He observed with his telescope all night, every night, while still working his day job (apparently he would snatch a few hours of sleep in the evening after work, and again at dawn after he was finished at the telescope). When he realised he didn’t know enough physics and astronomy to understand the things he was seeing, he took courses at the local university. Over the years, his observations painted a beautiful picture of the sky as seen with radio eyes. He detected the sweep of our Milky Way, with bright spots at the galactic centre (where Jansky had picked up his star-static), and again towards the constellations Cygnus and Cassiopeia. By this time he had learned enough physics to make scientific contributions, too. He knew that if the hiss from the Milky Way was caused by thermal emission – heat radiation from stars or hot gas – then it would be stronger at shorter wavelengths. Given that Reber was picking up much shorter wavelengths than Jansky (60 cm, compared to Jansky’s fifteen-metre waves), Reber should have been bombarded with invisible radio waves tens of thousands of times more powerful than anything Jansky saw. But he wasn’t. Reber was confident enough in his equipment to conclude that whatever was making these radio waves, it had to be ‘non-thermal’ – that is, it was something different from the standard ‘hot things glow’ radiation we discussed back in chapter 2. He even proposed the (correct!) solution: that hot interstellar electrons whizzing past an ion – a positively charged atom – will get sling-shotted around like a Formula 1 car taking a tight corner. The cornering electron will emit a radio wave, and the combined effect of billions of these events is what Reber was detecting from his back garden. This only happens in clouds of hot gas. Reber was, it turns out, picking up radio waves being emitted by clouds containing new-born stars scattered throughout our Galaxy. He was, quite literally, listening to stars being born. It was a sound no human had ever heard before. To this day, radio observations are used to trace the formation of stars, from small clouds in our own Milky Way to the birth of galaxies in the most distant corners of the Universe.</p><p>In many ways, Reber’s story seems like an anachronism. The golden age of independent scientists, who could make groundbreaking discoveries working alone with homemade equipment, was hundreds of years ago. With the passing of the Victorian era, science became a complex, expensive, and above all professional business. Grote Reber is, as far as I know, the last of the amateur ‘outsider’ scientists; the last person who had no scientific training, built his own equipment in his garden, and through painstaking and meticulous work managed to change the scientific world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-invisible-universe-matthew-bothwell-oneworld-press-163035122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">740af94f-87c0-437d-bcc2-0b88c87e434c</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642096440</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T17:54:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Sohm/Visions of America via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owens Valley Radio Observatory, OVRO, Bishop, California.

Terms banning the employee from discussing his job with potential employers amounted to a non-compete clause and were thus illegal in the state, the judge said.</p><p>The internet company originally persuaded a judge to toss out most of the worker&#39;s claims in the belief federal law overrode California legislation.

Google has declined to comment on either the verdict or any plans to appeal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The outcome wouldn&#39;t let Google employees discuss trade secrets if it was upheld. It would let people discuss work experience, though, and could make it easier for job-seekers to switch roles without fear of lawsuits.

It&#39;s thanks to this feature that the company calls the j7 a series of &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; devices because they should be able to successfully avoid a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis — your pet&#39;s accidents. iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (or P.O.O.P. for short) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if the robot fails to avoid a run in with poop during your first year of ownership.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Otherwise, the j7 series sits right under the s9 series in iRobot&#39;s lineup, meaning it has a number of advanced features like 10x the suction power of a standard Roomba, dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, the latter of which lets you direct the vacuum to clean only certain rooms. The &quot;plus&quot; part of the j7+ refers to the clean base, or an extended part of the dock into which the vacuum will empty its debris after every job. So instead of emptying the dustbin yourself after every cleaning, you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months. Combine that with the smart controls in the iRobot mobile app and you may only have to interact with the Roomba every so often — the app lets you do things like remote start the device, set cleaning schedules and more.</p><p>The s9+ is the most advanced device that iRobot makes and it has a few differences from the j7 series. It has 40x the suction power of iRobot&#39;s standard series of vacuums and a design that helps it clean corners better. It also has a 3D sensor that helps it detect and clean around objects, although the technology is slightly different than that in the j7 series. Both are compatible with Amazon&#39;s Alexa and the Google Assistant, too, so you can control the robo-vacs with voice commands if you wish.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-roomba-j7-poop-detecting-robot-vacuum-is-250-off-right-now-150019435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1a6f30-d78a-43f7-bc5c-203b54585169</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642175077</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T15:45:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will let dating apps in the Netherlands offer third-party payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is once again honoring regulations requiring it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html">allow alternative payment options</a> in the App Store, although this one is highly specific.

The website has temporarily suspended his account over COVID-19 misinformation, specifically for saying masks are useless in preventing the coronavirus&#39; spread. YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785">updated its rules</a> in 2020 to prohibit &quot;content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm.&quot; It doesn&#39;t permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities, such as the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>The organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks">considers</a> wearing masks &quot;a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.&quot; That&#39;s why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don&#39;t play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html"><em>Sky News Australia</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-suspends-one-american-news-network-221244594.html"><em>One American News Network</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-rand-paul-suspended-covid-19-misinformation-184047586.html">Senator Rand Paul</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension, because it&#39;s his first strike under the policy. If he gets another strike within 90 days, he&#39;ll get another two-week suspension. His channel will only be removed if he gets a third strike within three months. In addition to suspending his uploads, YouTube has also demonetized his channel for &quot;repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts.&quot; He will, however, be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it looks like Bongino has plans to keep on breaking YouTube&#39;s COVID-19 rules. The <em>Bongino Report</em> website&#39;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/BonginoReport/status/1482129629498462212">posted</a> a copy of his email to YouTube, which tells the customer service rep that he will &quot;immediately post content on why masks have been totally ineffective in stopping this pandemic&quot; after his suspension is over. He dared YouTube to do something about it. Bongino also called the website (and, by extension, Google) a &quot;tyrannical, free speech-hating, bullshit, big tech shithole.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dan-bongino-suspended-youtube-covid-19-misinformation-133519539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49f4cd5e-1fb6-4194-a088-85145d472336</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 13:35:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642253720</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T13:35:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/078267b0-b949-11eb-9ff9-829aa2516878" width="5482" height="3647" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/078267b0-b949-11eb-9ff9-829aa2516878" width="5482" height="3647" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roy Rochlin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 18: Host Dan Bongino as US Open winner Gary Woodland visits "FOX & Friends" at Fox News Channel Studios on June 18, 2019 in New York City.

According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work"><em>Motherboard</em></a>, Linktree, a tool that allows you to share multiple links with one URL online, has given sex workers the boot overnight and without warning. Banned users have taken to social networks like Twitter to announce that their accounts were banned &quot;for inappropriate use&quot; and didn&#39;t even get an email or any kind of notice about it. Some were reportedly billed for the service, which costs $9 per months for the Pro tier, but weren&#39;t refunded when their account was canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlene Bonnelly, Head of Trust &amp; Safety at Linktree, told the publication that the accounts that were banned shared a URL that violated its Community Standards. Bonnelly&#39;s statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Per our company&#39;s policies, the Linktree accounts banned stemmed from sharing a URL which violated Community Standards by sharing advertisements for the sale of real-life sexual services.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sex workers make use of tools like Linktree, because some platforms don&#39;t allow linking out to adult websites such as OnlyFans directly. Perhaps more importantly, they have to diversify make use of several websites, because they&#39;ll never know when a service will suddenly decide to ban adult content.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial services like PayPal, Visa and MasterCard, have long been known <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">to close</a> the accounts of people in the business of sex. Patreon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html">banned</a> content of a sexual nature back in 2017, and the number of services that decided not to host sex workers and their content have only grown since the US government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers.html">passed</a> FOSTA-SESTA a few years ago. Even OnlyFans, which has become synonymous with adult content, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-big-banks-war-adult-content-174041161.html">tried to ban</a> &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; in 2021 until it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-suspends-ban-on-sexually-explicit-content-132256309.html">suspended</a> its planned policy change.</p><p>Linktree&#39;s Terms of Service states that a user must not &quot;include any sexually explicit material (including pictures and language) on your Page itself or your account itself.&quot; However, it&#39;s vague and not entirely clear if linking to websites like OnlyFans has always been against its rules. It&#39;s also unclear why Linktree suddenly started banning sex workers when they&#39;d been using the service without issue for quite some time, but people in the business of sex may want to find another link-sharing tool they can use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/linktree-boots-sex-workers-overnight-114707878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf74fd2e-1551-478f-9946-1d5f91c788a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 11:47:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642247229</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T11:47:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LuckyStep48 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Abstract image of a tulip in the form of a starry sky or space, consisting of points, lines, and shapes in the form of tree, stars and the universe.

That same year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-oculus-link-quest-rift-vr.html"><ins>released Oculus Link</ins></a>, a feature that allows Quest users to connect the headset to their PC via a USB-C cable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s unclear how close the FTC may be to filing formal charges against Meta. The agency declined to comment on the matter for <em>Bloomberg</em>. However, what is clear is that Meta is firmly in the FTC’s crosshairs over its various acquisitions.

The result was that employees who worked remotely and called into meetings using a phone or PC were often more active and visible in meetings than their colleagues at the office who participated using a traditional conference room set up.</p><div id="a5caf5fd641145cc86e314edbf2639a1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CYEcepAXNr0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>However, thanks to the addition of Companion Mode, office workers will soon get access to most of Google Meet’s features via Nest Hub Max or <a href="https://meetingdevices.withgoogle.com/">other certified hardware</a> like a Lenovo Tap while still being part of the shared meeting. And while the Nest Hub Max might not be a common sight in conference rooms today, this new mode could help Google push more devices to businesses of all sizes as they adapt to post-pandemic working arrangements. To join a meeting using Companion Mode, you can either activate the setting in Google Meet’s “green room” or by using a dedicated URL: g.co/companion.</p><p>Google Meet features available in Companion Mode include chatting, starting and voting on polls, raising your hand (which includes displaying a person’s name and title), using host controls and turning on captions or translations.</p><p>Google says the goal is to ensure that regardless of where you’re working from, everyone in a video call will have access to a similar set of tools and features. Companion Mode will be enabled by default, though, for people using the free version of Meet, it’s important to note that anyone using it will count as an additional participant towards the 100-person limit, instead of a room full of people counting as a single attendee.</p><p>Companion Mode in Google Meet is rolling out this week, though depending on your domain or user type, it may take another few weeks for it to be available on your device.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-companion-mode-rolling-out-to-the-nest-hub-max-195017337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2f95eb00-b4f4-4aa9-bfd4-4029fd554b94</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 20:05:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642189472</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T19:44:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1daf1020-756d-11ec-97bd-ecd72b9916f0" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1daf1020-756d-11ec-97bd-ecd72b9916f0" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA - MAY 07: The new Nest Hub Max is displayed during the 2019 Google I/O conference at Shoreline Amphitheatre on May 07, 2019 in Mountain View, California.

Facebook’s advertising policies prohibit reproductive health products or services that focus on sexual pleasure, but anecdotes from the companies the Center for Intimacy Justice either interviewed or surveyed paint the picture of a platform that enforces those guidelines in a way that’s seemingly arbitrary and sexist.</p><p>The 60 companies that took part in the report have all had advertisements rejected by Facebook at one point or another. About half said they’ve also had their accounts suspended by the social media giant. One such company is <a href="https://joylux.com/">Joylux</a>. It offers <a href="https://joylux.com/collections/vfit-and-photonic-gel/products/vfit-gold">vFit Gold</a>, a product women can use to strengthen their pelvic floor. “Because of the nature of our product, the look of it,” Joylux CEO Colette Courtion <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/style/facebook-womens-sexual-health-advertising.html">told <em>The New York Times</em></a> Facebook and other companies believe it’s “pornographic” in nature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since 2017, Joylux claims Facebook has shut down its advertising account twice. It says the company never provided a reason for those actions. It also claims Facebook has automatically denied ads that include “vagina.” That’s something Meta, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook’s parent company</a>, disputes. A spokesperson for the company told Engadget<em>&nbsp;</em>it<em>&nbsp;</em>doesn’t enforce a blanket ban on keywords like “vagina” and “menopause.” Instead, it says it considers “how each ad is positioned.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe954ea0-7564-11ec-b17e-e61c9b7e780a" alt="Facebook ads" data-uuid="40023852-8aa8-3b11-8e21-c8028ab19b7a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Center for Intimacy Justice</div></figure><p>With help from an agency specializing in appealing ad rejections, Joylux has managed to get its ads up on Facebook in recent years. However, the company has had to change its copy to the point where those advertisements aren’t helpful to consumers. “We can’t show what the product looks like and we can’t say what it does,” Joylux told <em>The New York Times</em>.</p><p>A spokesperson for Meta told Engadget its enforcement isn’t perfect and that sometimes it makes mistakes. The company also noted it has its current policy in place in part because it strives to take into account what people from different countries and cultures will take away from ads that promote adult products.</p><p>“We welcome ads for sexual wellness products but we prohibit nudity and have specific rules about how these products can be marketed on our platform,” the spokesperson said. “We have provided detail to advertisers about what kinds of products and descriptions we allow in ads.”</p><p>What makes Facebook’s actions in these instances frustrating for the 60 companies that took part in the report is that they believe Meta hasn’t applied the same standards to ads targeting men. “Right now, it’s arbitrary where they’ll say a product is or isn’t allowed in a way that we think has really sexist undertones and a lack of understanding about health,” Jackie Rotman, the founder of the Center for Intimacy Justice, told <em>The Times</em>.</p><p>To that point, the organization found an ad promoting an erectile dysfunction pill that promised a “wet hot American summer.” Another, promoting a lubricant, said the lotion was “made just for men’s alone time.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/center-for-intimacy-justice-facebook-report-181456219.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2f7b64b-bc50-4f95-bc75-4e3f0f064536</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 18:14:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642184587</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T18:24:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e4a33d20-7566-11ec-95fe-60ed0535bed5" width="3025" height="2017" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e4a33d20-7566-11ec-95fe-60ed0535bed5" width="3025" height="2017" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An image of a woman holding a cell phone in front of a Facebook logo displayed on a computer screen.
