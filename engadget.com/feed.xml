But numerous rumors have indicted that Apple is working on major redesigns for its laptops soon, and the company already released an all-new iMac with Apple silicon inside. Now, it sounds like the Mac mini will get a big refresh soon, as well.</p><p>Both <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/22/gurman-updated-mac-mini-with-new-design-and-more-ports-coming-in-the-next-several-months/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/22/gurman-high-end-mac-mini-this-fall/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>MacRumors</em></a> are citing a newsletter from Bloomberg&#39;s reliable Mark Gurman that says a redesigned Mac mini with an &quot;M1X&quot; chip in it should arrive in &quot;the next several months.&quot; The M1X hasn&#39;t been announced, but it&#39;s been the shorthand over the last year or so for a chip that can outperform the M1 that Apple currently offers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to the new internals, Apple is also expected to redesign the Mac mini and add more ports to the small desktop computer. This Mac mini might be more focused on power users and will also likely cost more than the current models Apple offers, so it seems likely that the company will keep the M1 model around as a more basic and affordable option.</p><p>In addition to the Mac mini, Apple is also expected to introduce totally redesigned MacBook Pro models this fall, also sporting the more powerful M1X chip. It also sounds like Apple might take the multi-colored approach that it brought to the iMac earlier this year, as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m-1-x-rumor-194549101.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09b33ff5-c5d8-4735-9258-53d14f2b2fd2</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 19:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629656102</ingested><modified>2021-08-22T18:15:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f0e8370-0374-11ec-bb86-5c687a2ff8e1" width="1966" height="1098" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f0e8370-0374-11ec-bb86-5c687a2ff8e1" width="1966" height="1098" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[M1 Mac Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[M1 Mac Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook releases Q1 'widely viewed content' report following criticism]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">released its first &quot;widely viewed content&quot; report</a>, a document that essentially was the company&#39;s response to numerous reports that the most engaging content on the platform usually comes from polarizing and potentially misleading conservative figures and outlets, including Newsmax, Fox News, Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino. The report last week contradicted that, saying that in Q2 of 2021, top domains included more innocuous content coming from YouTube, Amazon, TikTok and a cat GIF from Tumblr.&nbsp;</p><p>But on Friday, the <em>New York Times</em> published a report saying that it had seen a &quot;widely viewed content&quot; report for Q1 of 2021 and that it showed different trends. For example, the most-viewed link was a story claiming a Florida doctor died from the coronovirus vaccine. Facebook has now confirmed the document&#39;s accuracy and <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ixy9meh6vari4lf/Q1-Content-Transparency-Report-V0-US-internal-copy%20%281%29.pdf?dl=0">released it directly</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone took to Twitter to get into the details of the report and said that Facebook withheld the report because &quot;there were key fixes to the system we wanted to make,&quot; but he didn&#39;t elaborate on what those fixes are.</p><div id="d87f77b8ffc1415c8abc3b51c0f49861"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On the question of the unreleased report from earlier this year and why we held it.

Of course not. No one is actually suggesting this and neither am I. But it does illustrate just how difficult it is to define misinformation.&quot;</p><p>As noted by the <em>New York Times, </em>Facebook has been trying to counter pressure around the things shared on its platform, specifically regarding misinformation around COVID-19 and its vaccine. Much of that pressure is coming directly from the US government.

Last December, Universal Music Publishing Group bought up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/music/bob-dylan-universal-music.html"><ins>Bob Dylan’s entire discography</ins></a> in a deal estimated at more than $300 million. Similarly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stevie-nicks-sells-stake-in-songwriting-catalog-11607095635"><ins>Stevie Nicks sold an 80 percent share of her works</ins></a> to Primary Wave Music for an estimated $100 million that same month. But as all this money changes hands for the industry’s biggest stars, one songwriting startup has plans to open the firehose of music royalties to the everyman.</p><p>“You see these huge deals, like the Bob Dylan deal with the publishing rights and all this money,” Alex Mitchell, co-founder and CEO of Boomy told Engadget. “It started with a recognition that most people are going to be left out of that and it caused us to have a conversation about equity in the music industry, &#39;how do we fairly remunerate artists, what&#39;s the role of labels,&#39; there&#39;s just chaos happening in the music industry right now.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mitchell realized that one major obstacle keeping amateur musicians from becoming published musicians was a technological one. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-beginner-home-music-studio-bedroom-producer-guide.html"><ins>Setting up a home recording studio is no small task</ins></a>, and teaching oneself how to navigate the hyper-granular control schemes of professional-grade DAWs (digital audio workstations) like Ableton Live or Pro Tools can take months, if not years, to fully master. But what if you had an AI-based co-writer to handle the heavy technical lifting instead, similar to what Tik Tok and Instagram do for their creators?</p><p>“We really started looking at what it takes to draw creativity out of somebody, what kind of tool can you put in their hands — where there&#39;s so much of the process that&#39;s semi- or fully-automated — that they can just add their own layer of humanity to it.” What they came up with was <a href="https://boomy.com/"><ins>Boomy</ins></a>.</p><p>“There&#39;s already AI being used in studios and in the music creation process,” Mitchell said. “A great example of this is <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/memberships.html"><ins>Ozone auto-mastering</ins></a>. They have used artificial intelligence to be able to create great mixes, put great final polish on tracks, things like that.”</p><p>“So what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve taken a lot of those concepts and we&#39;ve rewritten this stuff from the ground up,” he continued. “[It’s] less to think about how people usually make music, and more in the context of, if somebody doesn&#39;t have any skills at all, how fast can we get them making some stuff that they think is pretty cool?”</p><p>The web-based app is, essentially, a one-button music studio. Users can compose wholly original songs in around 5 to 10 minutes simply by clicking Create Song from the homepage, selecting the desired style of beat — whether that’s rap, lo-fi, experimental or “global grooves” — and then fiddling with the composition and mix until they’re satisfied. That song can then be uploaded to any of 40-plus streaming and social platforms where the song’s author can earn royalties based on the number of times their song is played.</p><p>Embedded below is a loopable, meditative jingle I put together during the course of my research. Despite my inherent lack of rhythm and general disinterest in music production, I found this to be a rather relaxing and enjoyable experience. After choosing the underlying beat and waiting a half-minute for the AI to generate a mix, the production process largely involved just shuffling icons around to adjust the composition and fiddling with dropdown menus to the instrument sets until I got something that I liked and think vaguely resembles the Konami menu screen music I grew up with. The entire process took less than 10 minutes.</p><div id="eb3a8259da87451f868b5d89cbedf0d2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/AL9rb5K5bt">https://t.co/AL9rb5K5bt</a></p>— Andrew Tarantola (@Terrortola) <a href="https://twitter.com/Terrortola/status/1428787534633439238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Unlike recurrent neural network analysis models such as OpenAI or Google’s Magenta which, for example, can analyze Michael Jackson songs to be able to recreate the King of Pop’s signature sound, Boomy is not trained on copyrighted works. This is due in part because of the highly-segmented nature of copyright law, which varies drastically between nations and territories, but also because of the black box nature of such systems. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"><ins>the infinite monkey theorem</ins></a> is any barometer, there is always a chance (albeit tiny) that a system trained on Michael Jackson might randomly spit out a perfect recreation of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA"><ins>Thriller</ins></a>.” And that’s very bad for the system’s designer.</p><p>“If I&#39;m a music publisher and I own the rights to Michael Jackson,” Mitchell said. “I&#39;m going to look at that model I&#39;m gonna say ‘great, you know what, that&#39;s all mine’… if you&#39;re making a copy of somebody else&#39;s work, even if it&#39;s transformed, you&#39;re probably going to owe some publishing on that.’”</p><p>Instead, the team is taking a bottom up approach, leveraging previous experience in A&amp;R research to train its AI in building beats and compositions from scratch. “We have some really advanced algorithms that are doing automatic mixing, deciding what sound should go together — what are the features of those sounds, how do those fit together, what is the perceived loudness rate of those sounds,” Mitchell explained.</p><p>Those features grew from a brute-force development approach — putting together various combinations of beats and compositions, then presenting them to beta testers. “In our first iteration of our model had a 98-percent rejection rate, but a 2-percent stay rate,” he continued. “And in that 2 percent, over millions of sessions, we started saying, ‘okay, here are groups of features that go well together.’”</p><p>Mitchell doesn’t view Boomy simply as a music creation tool, but as a means to achieve “​​the ideal world that we want to create,&quot; one which would allow creators anywhere on the planet to register themselves as a co-writer of their work alongside Boomy at their local publishing rights organization. However, because copyright law varies from country to country, Boomy has established an alternative way to ensure that songwriters get paid for their creative works.</p><p>“So what we&#39;re saying here is, a real world example would be, we just built a music studio, we filled it with great equipment, and spent millions of dollars building the studio,” Mitchell told Engadget. “You can come in and use it for free, make whatever you want, and on your way out,  we&#39;re assigning you to our label, and we&#39;re going to give you an 80 percent rev share on everything we collect from what you made in the studio.”</p><p>“The IP vests with us,” he continued, noting that Boomy has been used to create more than 3 million songs to date, “which actually makes us, ironically, the largest record label in the world.” For users who are either already established musicians or otherwise want to obtain sole ownership of their songs, ”they can submit a rights request, and we can basically either sell the copyright to them or come to some other arrangement.”</p><p>While Mitchell could not share exact figures with Engadget, he did estimate that in the two years since Boomy’s launch, the company has paid out “tens of thousands&#39; &#39; of dollars in royalties to its user base.</p><p>Moving forward, Mitchell foresees Boomy’s UI to add more additional control features and composition inputs, “over the next several months, we&#39;re really gonna focus and double down on vocal, melody and top line,” he explained.</p><p>The company is also working on new methods to earn royalties for its users. “We’ve got a bunch of influencer groups lined up and we&#39;ve been doing some stuff behind the scenes to place tracks into YouTube videos,” Mitchell continued. “If you&#39;re a creator, or if you&#39;ve got a podcast, rather than <em>go pay</em> for music rights, why not <em>get paid</em> for the music that you&#39;re using?”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ai-music-startup-boomy-looks-to-turn-the-record-industry-on-its-ear-190037786.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f567a2e-d2cf-47d3-9821-375d37d96449</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 16:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629485838</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T18:57:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89af2c20-01e5-11ec-be3c-7957cb2328c7" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89af2c20-01e5-11ec-be3c-7957cb2328c7" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[freestylephoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJ android, disc jockey robot pointing and playing music on turntables, cyborg on stage with deejay audio equipment, 3D rendering]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJ android, disc jockey robot pointing and playing music on turntables, cyborg on stage with deejay audio equipment, 3D render]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google is shutting down the Android Auto phone app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Android Auto is best-known as a way to access your phone through a car&#39;s dashboard — this lets you easily access Google Maps, music apps and data without needing to use your phone. But for years now, Google has also offered an Android Auto experience <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-android-auto-standalone-app-launch.html">directly on a phone</a>, for people who don&#39;t have a compatible dashboard unit. More recently, Google has also been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-assistant-driving-mode-215249421.html">working on an &quot;Assistant driving mode&quot;</a> (pictured above) that arrived earlier this year after a few delays. Now that Google Assistant driving mode is finished, though, the company will stop offering the old Android Auto experience on phones running Android 12.</p><p>A statement from Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/android-auto-phone-screen-stops-working/">shared with 9to5Google</a><em>&nbsp;</em>confirms this plan. Google Assistant driving mode is our next evolution of the mobile driving experience,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;For the people who use Android Auto in supported vehicles, that experience isn’t going away. For those who use the on phone experience (Android Auto mobile app), they will be transitioned to Google Assistant driving mode. Starting with Android 12, Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience. We have no further details to share at this time.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before Google confirmed this change, some Pixel owners running Android 12 received a notification when trying to run the Android Auto app on their phones. It said that Android Auto was now &quot;only available for car screens&quot; and recommended that they try the Google Assistant driving experience instead. Given that the new Google Assistant experience will clearly be the focus going forward, switching over probably isn&#39;t a big deal for most people. But if you don&#39;t upgrade your phone to Android 12, you&#39;ll be able to keep running the Android Auto app, at least for the time being.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-phone-app-shutting-down-130020711.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aeae1acb-89f5-4917-9e68-42f1ac1a810e</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 13:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629573099</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T19:11:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34d7eb50-02b3-11ec-bf33-6986941684b7" width="1893" height="1051" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34d7eb50-02b3-11ec-bf33-6986941684b7" width="1893" height="1051" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Assistant for driving mode]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Assistant for driving mode]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SiriusXM launches music channel dedicated to TikTok hits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can&#39;t escape viral <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-limits-teen-access-130931754.html">TikTok</a> songs.

The first color hand-held it might have been, but its small library of games (under 100 official titles) and general mishandling by Atari itself earned it little more than a walk-on role in gaming history for most people. As such, the homebrew and indie scene for the Lynx is pretty thin compared to its contemporaries (the Game Boy and the Game Gear).</p><p>The system still has its fans, though, (me included) and a few dedicated folks still hold a candle for the chonky handheld, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-21-wyvern-tales-lynx-homebrew-jrpg-irl.html">new titles</a> now more common than they were a decade ago. But the <em>real </em>rarity is the full, physical release. Here are four new games you can play on original hardware, complete with cartridge and box, just as nature intended.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Lynx diehards, there’s one destination to gather: <a href="https://atariage.com/">AtariAge</a>. And user Fadest (real name, Frédéric Descharmes) is one of the long-standing members of the handheld’s forum there. He’s perhaps best known for his Yastuna series of <a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/25-the-alchemy-of-cubes.html">puzzle games</a>. His two new releases keep the puzzle trend, but with a shoot-em-up/adventure twist.</p><p>Descharmes began programming for the Lynx as a way to channel his enthusiasm for retro gaming while he soothed his son to sleep late at night. He came to the Lynx specifically for its technological limitations (although it was advanced for its time). “I like the NES and Game Boy, and even code for them, but in my beginner situation, the Lynx was probably the best choice when I started in 2004,” he told Engadget.</p><p><a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/24-raid-on-tri-city-second-wave.html"><em>Raid on TriCity - Second Wave</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/61ff33b0-01c6-11ec-bffc-94e39240d675" alt="Raid on Tri City - Second Wave for the Atari Lynx" data-uuid="d318ab87-82b3-30ea-9c0d-af10169610c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fadest</div></figure><p><em>Raid on TriCity</em> takes the classic Tetris format and introduces a shoot-em-up component. As the blocks fall, you can’t move them or rotate them, but you can shoot them away brick by brick. You score, as normal, by completing lines (and not by shooting), and some of the Tetrominoes contain power-ups or enemies/ways to die.</p><p>Descharmes already released a pay-what-you-want ROM-only version of <em>Raid on TriCity</em>. “Second Wave” is essentially the same game as a physical release with some new in-game perks. The two most important ones would be the addition of an EEPROM for storing progress/high scores (no retail Lynx games ever had batteries or memory like some Game Boy titles did) and a new story mode which injects some life into an otherwise pick-up-and play time killer.</p><p>As simple as the game may sound, the hybrid dynamic picks the best elements of both genres and blends them to great effect. As you see blocks falling you have to make a quick decision about whether you want to go for a complete line, or whether a power-up might be more appealing or perhaps you have to sacrifice one to get rid of a baddie behind it. Sometimes this can be a bit of a gamble if a power-up you want has blocks above it that might bring you closer to the upper threshold and thus the end of the game.</p><p>Likewise, as lines complete and bring any power-ups above it one row down, a helpful bomb can become a death sentence (bombs trigger when a line is completed<strong>&nbsp;</strong>taking anything one square around it along with it — including your spaceship if you’re not careful).</p><p>The story mode isn’t exactly its own adventure, more it serves as a way to break up the game play with some narrative interludes and an element of interactivity in choosing your “path” through a network of levels. The levels themselves are really just more of the same shoot-a-block business, but it makes it feel more like making progress, and thus a game with an end to reach (rather than a high score to beat).</p><p><a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/22-asteroids-chasers.html"><em>Asteroid Chasers</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c23be3e0-01c6-11ec-bffb-c64baa997a51" alt="Asteroid Chasers for the Atari Lynx" data-uuid="c3f69aad-a3f2-3d53-a5cc-4e313e94688c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fadest</div></figure><p>Fadest’s second new title is another puzzler, but this time it’s more about strategy and fortune. I say fortune, but it’s usually mis-fortune to be fair. The game looks like it’s going to be a retro space shooter at first glance, but is more akin to a card game. Each turn you’ll be presented with an item/card and can only place it one square away in any direction from your last move. But each item/card will either be a scoring opportunity or a penalty of some kind.</p><p>This simple premise is deceptively addictive. There are four main “cards” to place: A probe, an asteroid (two types!) a mine or a pirate ship. Your job is to surround the asteroids with four probes to earn points (hence the game’s name). However, the pirates have other ideas and will disable any probes adjacent to them. This not only robs you of points, but can also be fatal: mines are diffused by surrounding them with probes, and you can only have three “live” ones on the map at any time. This means an ill-placed pirate, or just a string of bad luck with many mine cards can end your mission in a snap.</p><p>The goal is simple, reach the end of the “deck” while scoring as many points as you can along the way. At first, the game feels frustrating, as if you are merely at the whim of whatever cards are in the pile. And while this is true, you soon learn some strategies to increase your chances of getting to the end and racking up some points to boot.</p><p>For me, the fun of the game is built right into that frustrating nature. Many times I was killed early on, which only stoked my desire to beat the game and make it to the end. Once you do, you find yourself wanting to then beat your own high score. As with <em>Raid on TriCity</em>, <em>Asteroid Chasers</em> can remember your high scores giving the game longer term appeal. There are also many achievements to unlock (fortunately, also remembered) which will reward you with different music and other goodies giving this relatively simple game a lot more longevity than it first suggests.</p><h3>Songbird Productions</h3><p>If you’ve paid any attention to Atari’s handheld or the Jaguar indie scene in the last 20 years, you’ll be familiar with Songbird Productions. Not only is it a popular retailer of rare and homebrew games, its founder, Carl Forhan, is responsible for a number of Lynx titles being saved from obscurity by finding unfinished IP and seeing them through to completion, along with some original titles of his own.</p><p>One such title is <em>CyberVirus</em>, a first person space shooter. “In <em>CyberVirus</em>, I had to redo all the missions, redo the health and powerup system, and add new features to the game which were not in the original prototype.” Forhan told Engadget.  I also enjoy the purity of these older, smaller machines where you have to fight for RAM and CPU cycles to do everything. It&#39;s a fun challenge for my brain, I suppose.”</p><p><a href="https://songbird-productions.com/product/cybervirus-lost-missions/"><em>Cyber Virus - Lost Missions</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/acf68a30-01cb-11ec-bf3f-02947e713ac0" alt="Cyber Virus - The Lost Missions, new Atari Lynx game." data-uuid="9d6e8094-8ff6-359e-bfec-2a36b47cf081"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>This new title, as the name suggests, is a follow-up to the original <em>CyberVirus</em>. The first version was released almost 20 years ago and is one of the “unfinished” games that Songbird rescued. It’s also a rare first-person/3D shooter on the Lynx. <em>Lost Missions</em> is a collection of levels that were also in the original, developed initially by Beyond Games, and presented to Atari as a demo back in 1993.</p><p>The nine new missions see you take on a familiar cast of robotic foes as you seek to achieve your objective. This could be as simple as destroying some communication towers, but the number of enemies soon ramps up making each mission exponentially harder. You have a selection of weapons at your disposal and a semi-open 3D world to explore, not bad for a console released in 1989.</p><p>CV-TLM will appeal to fans of early first person shooters like <em>Doom</em>, but instead of a complex map you must navigate open terrain. Thank’s to the game’s origins, the graphics and gameplay are much nearer to those found in official releases (given that this nearly was one) compared to even some of the more ambitious homebrew titles that have emerged since the Lynx’s commercial demise.</p><p>The result is a fun, frantic shooter that deserved to make it onto shelves back in the &#39;90s. Forhan’s given the game the next best thing in this release which comes with a slick, glossy box and a physical cartridge that’s indistinguishable from the originals (many homebrew releases, including the above are 3D printed).</p><p><a href="https://songbird-productions.com/product/unnamed/"><em>Unnamed</em></a></p><div id="6c8f3473672d4e9cb00eb3a7ce31fda6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgSwFMKSWcI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The catalog of official releases for the Lynx tends to skew toward arcade titles, puzzlers and racing games. There’s a little bit of everything for sure, but adventure games and RPGs are generally lacking. <em>Unnamed </em>is a welcome salve, then, for fans of either of those genres. While the game is published by Songbird, it’s the work of Marcin Siwek who’s other Lynx title — <a href="http://totheunseen.kylos.pl/hg/unseen.html"><em>Unseen</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>— was a dark, choose your own adventure style game. Siwek’s second title is much more immersive with your onscreen character free to move around, find items and solve puzzles.</p><p>You awaken in a strange place with no memory of how you got there. Your task is to figure out why and how they find themselves in this strange world. Along your journey you find new rooms to explore and items to help you along the way. It’s a classic recipe, but one that lends itself particularly well to the handheld format.</p><p><em>Unnamed </em>is refreshing, not just for its playstyle, but as a true indie game (rather than a rescued abandoned title) it has a surprising amount of depth and atmosphere. Within moments of playing, I knew that this is a game that I would truly want to “get into” and complete. As with Descharmes‘ titles, <em>Unnamed </em>features an EEPROM for saving progress meaning you can pick it up without having to start from scratch every time.</p><p>The graphics are a good blend of cute and sinister and the music strikes the perfect balance of ambiance without being a distraction. The challenges and puzzles to be solved are pitched just at the right level and there’s a genuine sense of wondering if you might have missed something — which might sound annoying, but I think is the hallmark of a good RPG.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/atari-lynx-four-new-physical-games-183055733.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43dbb31e-ab28-4324-8ccf-ec9a5d49c291</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 20:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629558853</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T15:14:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3f555ab0-01cb-11ec-95de-fcf7f693d9bb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3f555ab0-01cb-11ec-95de-fcf7f693d9bb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New Atari Lynx games]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[New Atari Lynx games]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First look: Cadillac’s luxury EV debut seems like a winner]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="1515e0a843fa4f5dae26b1850fc89944"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3utXrXvmFE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As parent company GM begins its rollout of EV’s based on the Ultium battery platform, automaker Cadillac is readying its very first electric Caddy, the Lyriq, for production.

It&#39;s a Caddy with some extra bits of flair afforded to an EV including vertical headlights and taillights that are an homage to the automaker’s classic fin era.

Cherlynn Low spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 to determine who it’s really for. Terrence O’Brien compared and contrasted the Pixel 5a against previous versions to find out where the value lies in the upgraded model. Cherlynn also put the ASUS-Qualcomm Snapdragon smartphone through its paces to see how it stacks up against mainstream devices.</p><h2>The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">in the same price range as regular flagships</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a255b890-01e8-11ec-98dd-64816f12051f" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-uuid="243f6279-f8a0-3b72-8ff4-741a60b4ca45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low was upfront about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Z Flip 3" href="https://fave.co/3gch6c6">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a> in her review. Not only is it the best foldable phone yet with a fast, large screen, neat software tricks and water resistance, but it’s also now available at a (relatively) reasonable $1,000. She says it’s basically a regular smartphone that folds in half with a satisfying snap. The stronger aluminum, refined hinge and tough screen made it the first foldable she was willing to throw into a purse without worrying about scratching. She liked the widgets available for the Cover Display window, the new color options and the Flex mode, which assisted with one-handed use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite that, she still feels the Z Flip 3 is a hard sell. The battery life was woefully short and rarely lasted an entire day, and the software was a bit buggy. While most apps fit nicely on the screen, there was an occasional mismatch of aspect ratios that caused difficulties.

That being said, there’s still a few things about the 5a that make it worth considering. While the 5a keeps the same processor, RAM and camera experience as the previous version, it adds IP67 water and dust resistance and an incredible battery. Terrence said the 4,680mAh battery survived through nearly 23 hours of video play before powering down, and was still at 40 percent after 24 hours of general heavy usage.</p><p>The rest of the features on the 5a include a metal unibody with a matte texture, an upgrade to Gorilla Glass 6 and a 6.34-inch OLED panel with HDR support and 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. Terrence admits that the Snapdragon 765G processor is a bit outdated, but also says that the 5a still felt responsive and quick while reading email or playing <em>The Elder Scrolls: Blades. </em>However, it stuttered a few times while navigating YouTube and editing photos. The camera experience is also excellent, though the same as the features on the 4a 5G: an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 12.2-megapixel main lens and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle. Overall, Terrence’s biggest objection to the 5a was that it was a bit boring in that it’s very close to a reproduction of the 4a 5G.</p><h2>The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-for-snapdragon-insiders-review-140014488.html">truly isn’t for everyone</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/18b8e160-01e9-11ec-bffa-ac03ce015c64" alt="Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="0137e639-e049-3625-9d3d-5eb957b784ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Qualcomm and ASUS teamed up to create a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:smartphone" href="https://fave.co/37XhKFP">smartphone</a> for fans of the Snapdragon chipset, but Cherlynn Low says it&#39;s a bit too niche to broadly recommend.

So you could easily guess that the Pixel 5 is not long for this world, and you&#39;d be right. According to a statement <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/pixel-5-4a-5g-discontinued-after-5a-launch/">received by <em>DigitalTrends</em></a><em>, </em>Google is done selling the Pixel 5 as well as the Pixel 4a 5G.&nbsp;</p><p>“With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G).

And since the Pixel 5a is only being sold in the US and Japan, at least for starters, Google will be going without a 5G-capable phone in other markets until the Pixel 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p><p>That situation will likely be remedied soon — Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-5g-182238671.html">announced the Pixel 5</a> on September 30th last year, so it seems likely that we&#39;ll get an official reveal of the Pixel 6 sometime in the next month, as well. Google&#39;s Pixel phones have never exactly sold like gangbusters, but it&#39;s still somewhat surprising to see them pull the Pixel 5 so quickly in areas where they aren&#39;t seeing the 5a. But given that Google is already showing off the Pixel 5&#39;s successor, chances are good most people would wait that extra month to get the the company&#39;s next flagship.

AC Propulsion had learned this the hard way months earlier, in one of an increasing number of incidents that sent shudders through the battery industry. En route from Los Angeles to Paris, a shipment of AC Propulsion’s batteries caught fire as it was being loaded onto a FedEx airplane while it refueled in Memphis, triggering an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and prompting concerns about how to transport batteries in the future. Personal electronics companies, such as Apple Inc., were recalling devices with lithium-ion batteries out of concern they could overheat and catch fire. In 2004 and 2005, Apple recalled more than 150,000 laptops — with batteries made by LG Chem.</p><p>When LG Chem realized it had sold a large number of its batteries to a Silicon Valley startup that planned to use all of them for a single device — a car, as it happened — its legal department sent a letter demanding the cells be returned. The battery maker didn’t want to be associated with a potentially fiery experiment.</p><p>[Tesla&#39;s first CEO, Martin] Eberhard ignored the request. He had little choice. His bet that Tesla would be able to find a ready battery supplier was proving harder to cover than expected. Without these batteries, there might not be a second chance to get more.</p><p>Amid all of the attention on lithium-ion batteries, [Tesla Co-Founder/CTO, JB] Straubel thought back to his former house in LA, where he and [Tesla employee number 7, Gene] Berdichevsky celebrated the idea of an electric car by setting cells afire. If struck with a hammer, they put on quite a show. Cars were always in danger of that kind of impact, but there was also a more insidious threat. He began to wonder what might happen if one of the cells in the tightly packed cluster that would form a car’s battery pack got too warm.</p><p>One day in the summer of 2005, he and Berdichevsky decided to find out. With the office cleared out for the day, they went to the parking lot with a brick of cells — a cluster of batteries glued together. They wrapped one of the cells with a wire that would allow them to heat it remotely. Then, from a safe distance, they flicked the heater on. The individual cell quickly rose to more than 266 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius), causing the battery to flash into a blinding flame as the temperature spiked to 1,472 degrees, then explode altogether, sending the remaining skin of the battery into the sky like a rocket. Then another cell in the pack caught fire, launching into the air. Soon all of the cells were on fire. <em>Bang. Bang. Bang.</em></p><p>Straubel recognized the implications of his amateur pyrotechnics. If an incident like the one he cooked up were to happen in the wild, it could spell the end for Tesla. The next day, after they disclosed their experiment to Eberhard, they showed him the scorched pavement, pitted with holes from the night before. Eberhard urged them to be more careful, but he couldn’t deny that more testing was needed. He gathered the team at his rural house on the hills above Silicon Valley for more experiments. This time, they dug a pit and put a brick of cells in it, then covered it with plexiglass. They heated one of the cells and again the batteries ignited, causing a chain of explosions. Straubel had been right: this wasn’t good. They needed outside help to understand exactly what they were dealing with — the team needed battery experts.</p><p>Days later, a small group of battery consultants were gathered with what at first seemed like a manageable message: Yes, even the best battery manufacturers produced a random cell that would have a defect, causing it to short and catch fire. But the odds were remote. “It happens really, really infrequently,” one of the consultants said. “I mean like between one in a million and one in ten million cells.”</p><p>But Tesla planned to put about 7,000 cells in a single car. Sitting near Straubel, Berdichevsky pulled out his calculator and computed the likelihood that a cell in one of their cars might catch fire by chance. “Guys, that’s like between one in 150 and one in 1,500 cars,” he said.</p><p>And not only would they be churning out cars with defective batteries that, if ignited, could set off a chain reaction, but their cars could be detonating in the garages of the richest of the rich—burning down mansions and lighting up local TV news. The mood in the room shifted. The questions became more urgent: Was there anything that could be done to avoid defective cells?</p><p>Nope. Random cells were always going to get too hot and spark thermal runaway — basically an explosion sparked by overheating.</p><p>Straubel and the team returned to their work deflated. The stakes couldn’t have been higher for Tesla. This wasn’t just about solving a hard problem, one that threatened to drain limited resources and derail development of the Roadster. If they forged a solution that seemed to work, only to see Tesla vehicles catch fire in years to come, the company would be doomed. And it would be a failure not just for Tesla; their dreams of the electric car could be set back a generation. They could not only cause injury or death, they might kill the electric car in the process.</p><p>If they wanted to truly become an automaker, they had to face the challenge that GM, Ford, and others had been dealing with for a hundred years: They had to ensure they were putting safe cars on the roadway. A solution to thermal runaway could amount to a true breakthrough, one that would set Tesla apart from the auto industry for years to come. Using lithium-ion batteries had seemed like a smart idea, one that a number of thinkers had alighted on. But figuring out how to use them without turning the car into a ticking time bomb could be their greatest innovation.</p><p>They stopped work on all aspects of the Roadster project and formed a special committee to find a solution. The team set up whiteboards, listing what they knew and what they needed to learn. They began running daily tests. They’d configure a battery pack with the cells spaced differently, to see if there was an ideal distance for containing chain reactions. They tried different methods of keeping the batteries cool, such as having air flow over them or tubes of liquid brush past them. They’d take the packs to a pad used by local firefighters for training and ignite one of the cells to better understand what was taking place.</p><p>The danger of the situation was driven home while en route to one of those tests. Lyons, their recruit from IDEO, began to smell smoke coming from the back of his Audi A4, where he had loaded a pack of test batteries. It was a sign that a cell was heating up and approaching thermal runaway. He immediately stopped and yanked the batteries out of the car and threw them to the ground before his car could catch fire — a close call.</p><p>Eventually, Straubel began to narrow in on a solution. If they couldn’t keep a cell from warming, maybe they could keep it from reaching the point where it set off a chain reaction. Through trial and error, the team realized that if they had each cell lined up a few millimeters from its neighbor, snaked a tube of liquid between them, and dumped a brownie-batter-like mixture of minerals into the resulting battery pack, they could create a system that contained overheating. If a defective cell within began to overheat, its energy would dissipate to its neighboring cells, with no individual cell ever reaching combustibility.</p><p>Where just months earlier they had been struggling to set up a workshop, now they were on to something utterly new. Straubel was thrilled. Now he just needed to figure out how to convince the battery suppliers to trust them. Straubel was hearing from Eberhard that the established manufacturers weren’t interested in their business. As one executive at a supplier told Eberhard: You guys are a shallow pocket. We’re a deep pocket. If your car blows up, we’ll probably get sued.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-power-play-tim-higgins-penguin-randomhouse-153052075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84c69033-b971-4706-921c-92be29eb8177</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629501957</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T23:26:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/327de810-ff79-11eb-bd9d-5ab9fdc4c80d" width="4000" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/327de810-ff79-11eb-bd9d-5ab9fdc4c80d" width="4000" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Koehler via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERSTELAND, GERMANY - MARCH 02: A Tesla Model 3 plugged in and charging at a Supercharger rapid battery charging station for electric vehicles in Bersteland, Germany, on March 02, 2021.

Now, the automaker has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-health-environment-and-nature-bbe51b0c8e644c4448d634fc3c0f3461">expanded</a> the recall to cover all Bolt EVs and Bolt EUVs sold worldwide, starting from the first model up until the latest ones. This recall covers 73,000 additional vehicles, 60,000 of which are in the US, on top of the first batch of recalled Bolts.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon investigating the initial incidents, GM found a manufacturing defect in the Bolt&#39;s batteries manufactured at an LG Chemical Solution plant in South Korea. That became the basis for the models the automaker included in the first recall. AP reports that GM started investigating the newer Bolts after a 2019 model that wasn&#39;t included in the recall last year caught fire in Chandler, Arizona a few weeks ago, bringing the total number of battery-related fire incidents to 10. The company found that batteries made in LG&#39;s other sites could also suffer from defects, hence the recall expansion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GM will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-replace-chevy-bolt-battery-modules-fire-risk-100027066.html">replace</a> all five battery modules for models 2017 to 2019, while only defective modules will be replaced in newer vehicles. All fresh modules installed will come with a new eight year, 100,000 mile warranty. Until owners can get their cars in for module replacement, GM is advising them to limit charging to 90 percent of the battery capacity and to park outdoors. (The company previously determined that the vehicles that went up in flames were almost fully charged.) An email sent to owners contained a link to <a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall">instructions</a> on how to do just that by using the Target Charge Level mode. The automaker is also advising owners to charge their vehicle more frequently to avoid depleting their battery until there&#39;s less than 70 miles of remaining range.</p><p>This second batch of recalls will cost the company $1 billion in addition to the $800 million it&#39;s had to spend for the first one. Further, it remains to be seen how it would affect GM&#39;s EV push. In June, the automaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-self-driving-ev-investment-35-billion-035316455.html">increased</a> its combined EV and self-driving investment from 2020 through 2025 to $35 billion, in hopes that it can have 30 electric vehicles on the market by the end of 2025 and that it can exclusively sell EVs by 2035. For now, the company said it will stop producing and selling Bolts until it determines that there are no longer problems with LG&#39;s batteries.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af905ee3-fcd7-463c-871d-1858a10b962d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 11:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629547180</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T11:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/151533b0-026b-11ec-9f5d-06b039cc0b7d" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/151533b0-026b-11ec-9f5d-06b039cc0b7d" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California judge finds Prop 22 gig worker measure unconstitutional]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A California judge has ruled that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-voters-reaffirm-that-uber-drivers-are-indeed-employees-091216147.html">Proposition 22</a>, the measure that allows companies like Uber and Lyft to keep classifying app-based drivers in the state as independent contractors, is unenforceable and unconstitutional. According to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/Prop-22-the-gig-worker-exemption-for-Uber-and-16401915.php"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>, Alameda County Superior Court judge Frank Roesch found that Prop 22 illegally &quot;limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers&#39; compensation law.&quot;</p><p>Proposition 22 passed by a wide margin in the state when most people voted in favor of it in last year&#39;s November elections. Companies were legally obligated to classify gig workers as full-time employees under Assembly Bill 5 A (AB5), which was passed in 2019, but some (like the aforementioned ride-sharing firms) continued to treat them as contractors. Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash poured over $220 million into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-drivers-sue-prop-22-popups-194405188.html">campaigning</a> for Prop 22 in order to overturn AB5, and the move clearly worked.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The measure requires gig companies to provide their contractors with healthcare subsidies and a wage floor, but it also exempts them from having to classify their workers as employees with appropriate benefits and protections. While those in favor of the proposition argue that it would allow workers to keep their independence while enjoying benefits they didn&#39;t have before, not everyone&#39;s happy with the development. A group that includes the Service Employees International Union and the SEIU California State Council <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rideshare-drivers-challenge-prop-22-california-223019411.html">sued California</a> earlier this year to overturn the proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>In his ruling, Roesch specifically singled out Section 7451 of the measure, which states that any future law related to collective bargaining for app drivers must comply with the rest of the proposition. &quot;It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies in having a divided, ununionized workforce, which is not a stated goal of the legislation,&quot; he wrote in his decision. He also found it unconstitutional that any amendment to the measure requires a seven-eighths vote of approval to pass in the state Legislature.</p><p>If the ruling stands, gig companies like Uber and Lyft may have to spend hundreds of millions paying for healthcare and other additional benefits for their drivers. At the moment, though, Prop 22 is still in effect, and gig companies are already planning to appeal. An Uber spokesperson told <em>The Chronicle</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This ruling ignores the will of the overwhelming majority of California voters and defies both logic and the law. We will appeal and we expect to win. Meanwhile, Prop. 22 remains in effect, including all of the protections and benefits it provides independent workers across the state.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-judge-finds-prop-22-unconstitutional-043822868.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35c3dc55-1131-4252-b96a-30f0fddb63bf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 04:38:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629520706</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T04:38:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Referenda]]></category><category><![CDATA[Local Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/2aa89790-0c8f-11ea-bf93-5fc6d8839547" width="4379" height="2921" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/2aa89790-0c8f-11ea-bf93-5fc6d8839547" width="4379" height="2921" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[August 21, 2019 San Francisco / CA / USA - UBER headquarters in SOMA district; Uber Technologies, Inc. is an American multinational transportation network company (TNC)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[UBER headquarters in SOMA district, San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rhythm game 'Tetris Beat' is now available on Apple Arcade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the nearly 40 years since Alexey Pajitnov created <em>Tetris</em>, the game has inspired many permutations.

Starting in October, the company will ban the sale of sexually explicit content and depictions of sexual acts. The move does not cover all nudity, but says that specific rules will be outlined in an as-yet unpublished acceptable use policy. In a statement, OnlyFans said that the changes were prompted by “requests” made by its “banking partners and payout providers.” In short, the company’s arm has been twisted by the same big banks that have waged war on online sex work for years.</p><h2>Big Business</h2><p>The business can certainly attribute much of its success to enabling sex work and helping sex workers to get paid. Over the last two years, OnlyFans has grown from relative obscurity into a brand that is synonymous with adult content. Earlier this year, it boasted that its creators had earned more than $3 billion, and the platform was name-checked in a <a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/beyonce-onlyfans-savage-remix/">Beyoncé remix</a>. It’s believed that the company, which had around 7 million users in 2019, has seen that figure reach closer to 130 million in recent months. And, on June 16th, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/onlyfans-is-said-to-seek-funding-at-valuation-above-1-billion?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reported that the site was looking to attract investors in order to raise more funding at a valuation of more than $1 billion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ffbff4f39fbb4ff79f771ddb750616a1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">here&#39;s OF full statement. nice of them to throw the transparency report in there. here&#39;s that too: <a href="https://t.co/xfFrfmX4Wp">https://t.co/xfFrfmX4Wp</a><a href="https://t.co/8WqjSGjLUk">pic.twitter.com/8WqjSGjLUk</a></p>— Samantha Cole (@samleecole) <a href="https://twitter.com/samleecole/status/1428427032971649028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>It is clear, however, that a number of people who both create content for, and use, the site feel that the impending adult content ban is a betrayal. In a statement shared with Engadget, Isaac Hayes III, founder of Fanbase — a social media site that lets users sell their content — summed up the general sentiment rather neatly. Hayes said that the move was “disgraceful,” and that OnlyFans had “made billions off that user base.” He added that dumping sex workers after becoming a household name was “exactly what these platforms do. Discard the users who make it popular once they get what they want.” And in this case, it does seem as if the twin aims of securing more money from investors and retaining access to banking is what prompted the move. It’s a story that we’ve heard several times before.</p><h2>Deja Vu</h2><p>The most recent example, and one that we covered extensively at the time, was the cultivation and subsequent dumping of a sex work community on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html">Patreon</a>. Before 2017, the site had passionately and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/paypal-again-6071429">publicly courted sex workers</a>, encouraging them to use its platform. In 2016, it <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gv5dmb/patreon-paypal-adult-content">loudly defied</a> PayPal’s longstanding ban on payments to sex workers, allowing users to support content creators through its platform. At the time, Patreon even criticized PayPal’s lack of transparency, saying that its opaque policy “impacts the lives of Adult Content creators.”</p><p>This attitude did not, however, last very long. On September 15th, 2017, Patreon raised $60 million from investors, and updated its content policy a month later, seeming to repudiate the sex workers it had previously courted. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html">subsequent interviews</a>, the updated policy was described as not a big deal, with the company pledging to work with creators to ensure compliance. The general notion was that Patreon would crack down on content that was illegal or otherwise nonconsensual.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-29-patreon-crackdown-sex-worker-accounts.html">A year later</a>, however, and the site would further toughen its rules, saying that any and all adult content — including the famous erotic art project Four Chambers — was no longer permitted. (Four Chambers, the name of a British art-erotica collective led by artist Vex Ashley, was long held as the canary in the Patreon coal mine.) Patreon said that it had stepped up “proactive review of content [...] due to requirements from our payment partners.” In short, the same banks that Patreon had battled so loudly the year before had tied the site in knots, demanding it hunt out any and all content that could be considered adult.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that swerving away from sex work doesn&#39;t ensure the future prosperity of a business. In 2019, Patreon CEO Jack Conte told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/23/crowd-funding-platform-patreon-announces-it-will-pay-out-half-a-billion-dollars-to-content-creators-in-2019.html"><em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that its business model was not sustainable, and in April 2021, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/patreons-valuation-triples-to-4-billion-as-creators-and-fans-flock-to-platform-11617762374?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> said the site was still not profitable. Tumblr meanwhile, which under Engadget’s parent company mass-purged adult content from its site in 2018 but left a wide variety of <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/far-right-content-survived-tumblr-purge-36635e6aba4b/">neo Nazi content</a> on its platform, saw its valuation fall from $1.1 billion in 2013 to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/13/tumblr-once-sold-billion-owner-wordpress-just-bought-site-fraction-that/">just $3 million</a> in 2019.</p><h2>Tangled up in Paperwork</h2><p>Back in April, <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/perspectives/2021/protecting-our-network-protecting-you-preventing-illegal-adult-content-on-our-network/">MasterCard</a> announced that it would further toughen the reporting requirements around adult content. John Verdeschi, Senior Vice President, wrote that banks using its network would need to “certify that the seller of adult content has effective controls in place to monitor, block and, where necessary, take down all illegal content.” This includes rules requiring platforms to keep a record of the identity of every performer shown, as well as who uploads the content. In addition, all content would need to be reviewed prior to release, and all platforms need to run a beefed-up complaints resolution process to take down illegal or non-consensual material within seven days.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20210415/11413646621/mastercard-lays-down-new-rules-streaming-sites-that-require-them-to-review-content-before-publication.shtml"><em>TechDirt</em></a> wrote back then, as reasonable as these policies sound, they seem intentionally designed to block all adult content, not just the illegal stuff. As it explains, “the new policy [...] makes it impossible for streaming platforms to comply with the new rules. Since they’re not able to prescreen streamed content, they’re [sic] just going to start blocking anything that seems like it might lead to MasterCard pulling the plug.” Mary Moody tweeted, upon announcement of the policy change, that “OnlyFans, MyFreeCams &amp; more are in danger.” As with Patreon, MasterCard&#39;s reporting requirements appear to be such a burden that companies would rather avoid the issue altogether than attempt to comply.</p><div id="a63b5570a7a84f39b42b1234e2f08423"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today MasterCard introduced a policy that will ban much of online sex work, especially live streaming. <br><br>OnlyFans, MyFreeCams &amp; more are in danger. <br><br>We need <a href="https://twitter.com/ACLU?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ACLU</a><a href="https://twitter.com/RoKhanna?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RoKhanna</a><a href="https://twitter.com/AOC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AOC</a><a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ewarren</a><a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@RonWyden</a> to investigate this financial discrimination immediately.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MasterCensors?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MasterCensors</a><a href="https://t.co/DUR93QXCXQ">pic.twitter.com/DUR93QXCXQ</a></p>— OF SALE🌈Mary Moody in VICE, NBC, &amp; BBC ✨ (@missmarymoody) <a href="https://twitter.com/missmarymoody/status/1382405311210745858?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This isn’t a new story, however, and in 2015 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">Engadget laid out in detail</a> how banks were systematically withdrawing access for adult content platforms. This isn’t just prohibitions on working with select adult content sites, but a blanket-ban that impacted individuals beyond their life in the sex industry. JPMorgan Chase shut down a number of bank accounts owned by adult performers, and refused banking services to a company that makes condoms. This crackdown had an disproportionate impact on individual accounts held by women and LGBTQ people.</p><h2>The Right</h2><p>This crackdown is part of a broader alliance between banks, lawmakers, right-wing pressure groups and religious extremists. As <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub"><em>The New Republic</em></a> explained late last year, these groups have been able to use the cover of <a href="https://wagner.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congresswoman-ann-wagner-leads-bipartisan-coalition-calling-for-doj-to">sex trafficking</a> to push an anti-porn, anti-sex agenda. The movement’s most successful victory was the passing of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers.html">FOSTA-SESTA</a>, a US law designed to tackle human trafficking by neutering the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-31-sex-censorship-killed-internet-fosta-sesta.html">safe harbor provisions</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-s230-repeal.html">Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996</a>. Despite contravening the first amendment, the move has not shut down many groups of human traffickers, but has closed safety services created for, and used by, sex workers, and even forced Barnes &amp; Noble to purge its ebook store of erotica.</p><p>Naturally, OnlyFans became a clear target of those campaigners both because of its success and because it contradicted their narrative. By enabling individuals to sell their material to consumers without intermediaries, it was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-fragile-existence-of-sex-workers-during-the-pandemic">allowing people to make a living</a>. You can also argue that sites like OnlyFans have enabled people otherwise excluded from the workforce — this report from <a href="https://arousibility.com/blog/my-sex-work-story/"><em>Arousability</em></a> explains that a person with chronic pain who can’t work a 9-to-5 job found that sex work offered them financial independence they couldn’t have found otherwise.</p><h2>Alternatives</h2><div id="2396859e80a740a9950eecaac5f5fa60"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are drawing together a list of resources for sex workers impacted by the OF ban. <br><br>If you are a sex worker with experience of online work and you have a bit of time today to add any advice, tips or recommendations to it, please DM us or email mutualaid@swarmcollective.org</p>— SWARM (@SexWorkHive) <a href="https://twitter.com/SexWorkHive/status/1428677388729212936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>While creators wait for OnlyFans to detail just what content will be allowed, in its brave new world, many may wish to take their business elsewhere. There are a number of platforms that occupy a similar space in the market, including AVN Stars, FanCentro, Unlockd and AdultNode. Just For Fans, for instance, says that it is a sex worker owned-and-operated platform, and that it will welcome any and all creators that OnlyFans has “abandoned.” Similarly, a number of in-progress projects to build more sex-worker owned and operated platforms are currently underway.</p><div id="104d906c6d1f435f8a197a30a47e55c9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our statement based on today’s news. <a href="https://t.co/3PHKmkQ5qQ">pic.twitter.com/3PHKmkQ5qQ</a></p>— JustForFans (@JustForFansSite) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustForFansSite/status/1428430713708290048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>It’s likely that this will be seen as another reason to switch to a blockchain and cryptocurrency-based system as a way of escaping the reach of big banking. There are several, including SpankCoin and Nafty, that offer sex workers the ability to sell content through their systems. And as more major platforms are picked off by a combination of payment processors and regulators, this space is going to grow.&nbsp;</p><p>But there are inherent risks to switching, including currency fluctuations and the risk that a sex work-specific currency can still be excluded from mainstream exchanges. And then there’s the fact that if a platform gets big enough, it gets noticed — and targeted — by anti-sex advocates. Crypto can shore up the finances, but pressure can always be exerted on providers, hosts and platform owners wherever they may be.&nbsp;</p><p>And that often forces creators to leap from platform to platform to keep one jump ahead of the people who want to strip them of their ability to make money. But every time they do so, they risk losing their user bases, and have to expend time and energy to recover the fans that they already had. Either way, until there is better political and corporate leadership who can handle the nuanced situation of online sex work, individuals will often be left with no choice but to keep moving, or sink.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-big-banks-war-adult-content-174041161.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24594e7c-1749-4992-b28c-0b3a81b3f941</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 17:40:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629481013</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T17:36:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c859e9f0-0150-11ec-bdef-9838cd66df81" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c859e9f0-0150-11ec-bdef-9838cd66df81" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnlyFans logo displayed on a phone screen and a website in the background are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on April 27, 2021.

Now, two Princeton University academics say they know the tool Apple built is open to abuse because they spent years developing almost precisely the same system. “We wrote the only <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity21/presentation/kulshrestha">peer-reviewed publication</a> on how to build a system like Apple’s — and we concluded the technology was dangerous,” assistant professor Jonathan Mayer and graduate researcher Anunay Kulshrestha wrote in an op-ed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/08/19/apple-csam-abuse-encryption-security-privacy-dangerous/"><em>The Washington Post</em> published</a> this week.</p><p>The two worked together on a system for identifying CSAM in end-to-end encrypted online services. Like Apple, they wanted to find a way to limit the proliferation of CSAM while maintaining user privacy. Part of their motivation was to encourage more online services to adopt end-to-end encryption. “We worry online services are reluctant to use encryption without additional tools to combat CSAM,” the researchers said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two spent years working on the idea, eventually creating a working prototype. However, they quickly determined there was a “glaring problem” with their tech. “Our system could be easily repurposed for surveillance and censorship,” Mayer and Kulshrestha wrote. “The design wasn’t restricted to a specific category of content; a service could simply swap in any content-matching database, and the person using that service would be none the wiser.”</p><p>That’s not a hypothetical worry either, they warn. The two researchers point to examples like WeChat, which the <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2018/08/cant-picture-this-an-analysis-of-image-filtering-on-wechat-moments/">University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab</a> found uses content-matching algorithms to detect dissident material. “China is Apple’s second-largest market, with probably hundreds of millions of devices. What stops the Chinese government from demanding Apple scan those devices for pro-democracy materials?” Mayer and Kulshrestha ask, pointing to several instances where Apple acquiesced to demands from the Chinese government. For example, there’s the time the company gave <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-chinese-government-control-data-131343119.html">local control of customer data</a> over to the country.</p><p>“We spotted other shortcomings,” Mayer and Kulshrestha continue. “The content-matching process could have false positives, and malicious users could game the system to subject innocent users to scrutiny.” Those are concerns privacy advocates have also raised about Apple’s system.</p><p>For the most part, Apple has attempted to downplay many of the concerns Mayer and Kulshrestha iterate in their opinion piece. Senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-on-confusion-over-child-safety-updates-csam-150121989.html">attributed the controversy to poor messaging</a>. He rejected the idea the system could be used for scanning for other material, noting the database of images comes from various child safety groups. And on the subject of false positives, he said the system only triggers a manual review after someone uploads 30 images to iCloud. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple for comment on the op-ed.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite those statements, Mayer and Kulshrestha note their reservations don’t come from a lack of understanding. They said they had planned to discuss the pitfalls of their system at an academic conference but never got a chance because Apple announced its tech a week before the presentation. “Apple’s motivation, like ours, was to protect children. And its system was technically more efficient and capable than ours,” they said. “But we were baffled to see that Apple had few answers for the hard questions we’d surfaced.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/princeton-university-researcher-apple-csam-oped-162004601.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">72a03e1b-26a7-441d-a0a1-d7764c20d021</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 16:20:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629476354</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T16:19:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/3afef9f0-7ab5-11eb-bd7f-121fb1272d3e" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/3afef9f0-7ab5-11eb-bd7f-121fb1272d3e" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 lineup]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 lineup]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile says data for 6 million additional customers was compromised in breach]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> says millions more people have been impacted by its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-confirms-data-breach-203719462.html"><ins>recent data breach</ins></a> than initially believed.
