You&#39;ll also see the number of games you played and get a code for four avatars as a bonus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony took the opportunity to promote some of its games by highlighting some global community stats. In <em>Death Stranding Director&#39;s Cut</em>, for instance, players collectively traveled more than 45 million kilometers and delivered more than 9.4 million packages. They played more than 12 million hours of <em>Returnal </em>in total, while 34.6 percent of <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>players unlocked all of the weapons.</p><p>Users need to be aged 18 or over and have played at least 10 hours of games on PS4 or PS5 to access their Wrap-Up.

This new hardware is a technical marvel, packing many of the features that most wrist-worn devices take for granted. But the need to keep the cash rolling in has seen Oura, like Fitbit, Apple, Wahoo and others, pivot to a recurring-revenue model. Oura says that this is key to shift from the idea of buying a device that never changes, to supporting its broader goals of building an evolving fitness ecosystem.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b903560-7944-11ec-b9fe-61535a9da23e" alt="Image of the inside of the Oura Ring (v3)" data-uuid="720b286c-d652-32d0-8275-defe9e2508b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Before we get into the specifics of this new Oura ring, let’s take a moment to remember that this device is still a marvel of engineering. Taking the sensors from a smartwatch or fitness tracker and shrinking them into a ring is worthy of enormous praise. For all of its imperfections, it’s amazing to see Oura push the limits of what is capable in such a small form factor. And there’s much more tech crammed in this time around, despite the size and weight remaining the same as the second-generation version. The headline features these new sensors enable include continuous heart-rate tracking, temperature monitoring, blood oxygenation and period prediction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The sizing process is the same for pretty much every smart ring I’ve ever tried: The company sends you a set of plastic dummy rings you have to wear for a couple of days. Once you’ve determined the correct fit, which is tight and secure around the base of your index finger, but not to the point where it’s uncomfortable, you can order the real thing. This actually was the most stressful part of this review, since I felt that one size was too loose, the other too tight, but I opted for looseness rather than sacrificing a digit to the gods of fitness tracking. Oura says that the index finger is the best place for its ring, but you can stick it elsewhere if you prefer.</p><p>Unfortunately, the one thing you can’t do much about is the size of the ring itself which is a bit too big. I’m a big-ish guy with big-ish hands, but it feels a bit too ostentatious on my fingers, enough that people notice and ask me what it is as soon as they spot it. If you have more slender hands, I’m sure you might have a similar issue with folks pointing it out. I suspect that the smart thing to do is visit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/partsof4/">Parts Of 4</a> to get some more adornments to balance out the look.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Without a screen, Oura is yoked tightly to the iOS or Android app where all of this data will be displayed. The Oura app is clean and tidy, only giving you the deepest data when you go looking for it. The app breaks down all of the information generated from your finger and compresses it into three scores, which are shown on the homescreen. These are for Readiness, Sleep and Activity, representing how prepared you are to face the day, how well-rested you are and how much exercise you’re doing.</p><p>The only other thing you’ll find on the homescreen is a breakdown of your heart rate across the day, showing you where the peaks and troughs are. You’ll also get advice on your ideal bedtime, which is useful when you’re working late nights and need to juggle sleep with getting things done. You’ll also get periodic reminders to move if the app detects you’ve been still for a while, and advice when it’s time for you to wind down for the day.</p><p>Go into one of the categories, like Readiness, and you’ll get scores for your recovery index, sleep, as well as your HRV balance, body temperature and resting heart rate. You can also see that my figures dropped quite substantially during a three-day period when I got food poisoning from a New Year’s Eve takeaway meal. During that period, I was given plenty of warnings telling me I wasn’t rested or well enough to do much else – not that I felt like I was gonna go for a run or anything.</p><p>As part of Oura’s plan to add extra value to its platform, the company is adding a series of video and audio guides for meditation, breathwork and sleeping. These guides, which are essentially guided meditation audio tracks, can be backed with a white noise option of your choice. You can pick the hum of a train station, the crunch of a forest stroll, the sound of the tide lapping at the land or rainfall, amongst others. These are a thing for people who find those things useful to fall asleep and feel restful but I, personally, do not find them that great.</p><p>That said, where Oura differs from its rivals in this space is that it’ll break down your vital signs during your meditation. If you’re wondering how to get better at meditating then you’ll be guided to more appropriate tracks that’ll help prod you toward nirvana.</p><p>Oura is working on adding more features to the Ring v3 over the next year, including more content as well as more accurate sleep and period tracking. These will not actually appear as new features so much as they are behind-the-scenes improvements in the underlying systems. Finally, at some point this year, the ring will be able to identify your blood oxygenation (SpO2) while you sleep in order to help detect disorders like sleep apnea.</p><h2>In use</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/526ac9f0-7944-11ec-97ff-4f9abb1a59bd" alt="Image of the Oura Ring V3 on its charging plate." data-uuid="4b370404-2a61-3ced-a04c-6866f66a1208"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The best thing about the Oura ring is that, once you’ve worn it a few days, you quickly start to ignore its presence. And while you’re not paying attention, it begins worming its way into every corner of your life, learning your working patterns and getting ready to make helpful suggestions. If you feel like crap in the morning but don’t have the mental wherewithal to comprehend why, you’ll be told as soon as you look at your phone. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing here that other platforms don’t do as well, but this is certainly an elegant implementation of the idea.</p><p>Sleep tracking is generally fine, by which I mean it works by tracking movement and therefore can’t tell when you’ve been rudely awoken but haven’t moved. As part of this new pivot, however, Oura is promising that the sleep tracking will soon become vastly more accurate as a consequence of behind-the-scenes changes. This will not be readily visible to users, however, since all you’ll get is a pop-up telling you that things just got more accurate. Still, it offers a fairly good indicator for how the night went, although I find the activity tracking to be a little more on the generous side. Yesterday morning, for instance, it told me that my morning shower was a strength training workout with plenty of burned calories for my trouble. Similarly, it’ll tell me around lunchtime that I need to take a half-hour brisk walk to finish my activity for the day, and then by early evening, having done nothing more than stand at my desk, make dinner and put my kids to sleep, it’ll tell me I’ve completed my goal.</p><p>One of the features that Oura is tempting its users with is Workout Heart Rate, which I find inadvertently amusing. Because the ring is so chunky, and it has such a hard edge, that I really don’t find it comfortable to wear during workouts. For instance, if I’ve got a pair of free weights, or I’m doing an incline push up on a Smith machine bar, the ring just pushes into the fleshy parts of my hand. For most of the proper “gym” workouts I’ve done, the ring has had to come off, lest I tap out too early or draw blood from the chubby parts of my fingers. But for more ring-friendly jobs, like running, walking, or cycling, you should find this to be a big help.</p><p>In terms of vital-signs tracking accuracy, I think it’s always wise to remember that wearables will not be as inch-perfect as a clinical-grade device. But in a number of random spot-tests, the Oura offered the exact same figures as the Apple Watch on my wrist. In fact, Oura’s reputation for accuracy has always been pretty high, and one of the reasons that the company hasn’t released some of these features is to ensure they’re ready to go when they do arrive.</p><p>Oura quotes battery life at seven days, although I rarely managed to get past five without having to drop it on the charging plate. Certainly, real-world stamina is a bit far from what the company is saying, but then it’s hardly a deal breaker since you can charge it full in two hours. It’s become common for me to take the ring off while I’m standing at my desk on Monday and Friday mornings and let it re-juice while I’m working.</p><h2>Economics</h2><p>The third-generation Oura ring will set you back $299, which gets you the ring in one of four finishes: Silver, Black, Stealth or Gold. In the box, you’ll receive the charging plate and a USB-C cable, and as part of the deal, you’ll get a six-month trial of Oura’s subscription service. Membership, which costs $5.99 a month for new users, will entitle you to “daily health insights,” “personalized recommendations,” as well as more video and audio sessions. Any existing Oura user who upgrades to the new ring will get a lifetime membership thrown in for free.</p><p>I want to be fair here and say that I understand why Oura is pivoting to this recurring revenue model. It’s not as if other companies in this space, like Fitbit, aren’t doing the same in the hope of bolstering their bottom lines. And that’s before we get to talk about how much lock-in the Apple Watch gets as a consequence of Fitness+. But I also think there’s a difference between the sort of product that those rivals are offering compared to Oura’s product.</p><p>After all, Apple and Fitbit can both offer coaching both on their devices and on bigger screens, which Oura can’t. Not to mention that Oura is really only able to offer guided audio clips (and short videos) through its app. And that while Apple and Fitbit are selling their devices as (having the potential to become) Capital-F Fitness gear, the Oura really isn’t. But, then again, that’s not what Oura is pitching here – it’s for the meditator, the runner, the cyclist, who doesn’t want to strap something beefy to their wrist.</p><h2>Wrap-Up</h2><p>Here’s the problem with reviewing Oura: It’s not a device that every fitness person will love. If you want something with more versatility, you’d buy a smartwatch and have done with it. Oura is more of a subtle product, for people who want to be less ostentatious about their health, or simply want something that slips into their lives and does the job. Honestly, since I’m not a gym bro, I really like the data the ring offers me without any fuss or muss.</p><p>As for the subscription, it’s likely that Oura will have to keep squeezing as many new features and insights as possible out of this new hardware. Between that, and vastly improving its currently slender content library, it’s worth it if you’re a paid-up member of the Oura family. But, and this is more a comment on the industry as a whole rather than a slight against Oura itself, I do find this need for every company to squeeze some rental income out of their users to be a little bit grating.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oura-ring-version-3-150032257.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4bfda2b-579a-4214-89c2-7c226573a354</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642692415</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T15:27:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd04bf00-7a03-11ec-994f-a73647b31fc8" width="1844" height="1157" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd04bf00-7a03-11ec-994f-a73647b31fc8" width="1844" height="1157" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Oura Ring V3 displayed on someone's finger with their hand palm-down on a table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oura Ring V3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What we bought: A rice cooker whose greatest trick isn't actually rice]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Every month, Engadget features what our editors are currently into, whether it be </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-squadrons-vr-campaign-scoping-irl-153054256.html"><em>video games</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-were-listening-to-mockery-manor-podcast-140004760.html"><em>podcasts</em></a><em> or gadgets. These are not official reviews; they’re simply our first-hand experiences. This week, Senior Editor Nicole Lee gives her take on the Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker.</em></p><hr><p>A long-standing joke among my family and friends over the past couple of decades is that I’m not a true Asian. Why? Because I didn’t have a rice cooker. Since rice is a staple of the Asian diet, rice cookers are commonplace in most Asian households. But for years, I refused to get one. That is, until recently, when I finally gave in and got a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$198 Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" href="https://amzn.to/33pJZyk">$195 Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker</a>. And ironically, what I ended up liking most about it isn’t rice at all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reason I held off was mostly that I didn’t think I needed it. Since I only live with my husband, I told myself I didn’t need a single-purpose appliance. After all, I could already make rice on the stove with just a saucepan. I’ve become adept at making small portions of rice over the years. Plus, it only takes 18-or-so minutes. A rice cooker, on the other hand, can typically take 35 minutes or longer. So even though I enjoy rice enough to make it regularly, I just couldn’t quite justify the seeming inconvenience.</p><p>This, however, was challenged over this past winter break. We had our family over on Christmas Eve, so I ordered takeout from a local Chinese restaurant. At one point, we ran out of rice, so I set about making more on the stove. I had to make rice for around 10 people, which I’m not used to doing. Long story short, my calculations were off, and the rice I made ended up crunchier than I would like. Of course, my family didn’t complain, but I was still a little upset with myself. That’s when I reconsidered getting a dedicated rice cooker.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/474c7f90-7990-11ec-9bd3-8c1203b5fecb" alt="Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" data-uuid="216cf6c5-2664-34df-bc7c-f90612147a83"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>After some research, I opted for the Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker. Sure it’s expensive – you can easily get <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:basic models for less than $50" href="https://amzn.to/3GLpzxP">basic models for less than $50</a> – but I wanted one that can cook all kinds of rice such as short-grain and medium-grain white rice, long-grain jasmine rice, sweet (or sticky) rice, brown rice and more. More importantly, I wanted a cooker with “fuzzy logic” (yes, that’s an industry term), which essentially means that the device has a computer chip. This gives it the smarts to adjust temperature and cook time to accommodate other variables, such as human error (like what I experienced over Christmas), to ensure perfectly cooked rice every time.</p><p>I’ve now had it for a few weeks, and I love it. It really does make cooking rice so much easier. Instead of having to fuss over the stove, I can just rinse the rice, add water, push a button and walk away. It also has a “Keep Warm” function that lasts over five hours, giving me plenty of time to prepare dinner as the rice cooks. It also comes with a handy guide that tells you the proper rice and water ratio for all the different kinds of rice. On top of that, it has a timer so you can have the rice ready whenever you want it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b09af6c0-7990-11ec-b3dd-5ab838673902" alt="Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" data-uuid="780de57b-d3f6-380b-86a5-48a719d45b89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>But I’d argue the killer function of the Neuro Fuzzy isn’t rice at all. I’ve discovered that it actually makes amazing oatmeal from steel-cut oats. I learned about this from an NYT Cooking recipe for “<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019528-rice-cooker-steel-cut-oats">Rice Cooker Steel-Cut Oats</a>,” (link requires subscription) and it is really such a game changer for me. Steel-cut oatmeal usually takes 20 or so minutes to make, and I don’t usually have time for it in the mornings. But with the rice cooker, I just dump in one cup of oats followed by four cups of water and a teaspoon of salt before I go to bed, set the timer for 8AM, toggle the menu to the Porridge setting, press Cook, and I get to wake up to fresh oatmeal every morning. What’s more, the resulting oatmeal is the best I’ve ever had. The texture is so creamy and smooth, making it the perfect vehicle for both sweet and savory applications. I like mine with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYZybe9vS3N/">spam, spinach and furikake</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, and it admittedly sounds silly to talk about a rice cooker this way, but the Neuro Fuzzy is just <em>adorable</em>. Its long oval shape gives it a rounded, egg-like appearance that I find aesthetically pleasing. It also plays a tune whenever it starts or ends cooking. My favorite design feature, however, is its power cord: it’s retractable! This way you can store it away without a nest of cables to contend with.</p><p>Perhaps the only real downside of the Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker is that it’s pretty slow. White rice takes around 40 or so minutes to cook, while brown rice can take 90 minutes or longer (stovetop timing on the other hand, ranges from 18 minutes for white rice to 45 minutes or so for brown rice). Still, that’s a small price to pay for perfectly cooked rice, creamy morning oatmeal and, hopefully, no more ruined Christmases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zojirushi-neuro-fuzzy-rice-cooker-irl-144543841.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">72c15ce3-be63-4960-baca-0114428b1fd4</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:45:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642695226</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T16:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[US International News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/805a5d20-7990-11ec-bced-3e1baea8896f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/805a5d20-7990-11ec-bced-3e1baea8896f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why airlines and telecoms are fighting over the 5G rollout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rollouts of new wireless technologies and standards have not always gone well. When the GSM system debuted, it <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/19950724/archived-articles/gsm-hearing-aid-debate-ignites-into-war">caused hearing aids to buzz and pop with static</a> while early cell phone signals would <a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/magnets-cell-phones-and-smart-watches-may-affect-pacemakers-and-other-implanted-medical-devices">occasionally disrupt pacemakers</a>. Today, as carriers expand their 5G networks across the country, they are faced with an equally dangerous prospect: that one of 5G’s spectrum bands may interfere with the radio altimeters aboard commercial aircraft below 2,500 feet, potentially causing their automated landing controls to misjudge the distance from the ground and crash.</p><p>Sticking the landing is generally considered one of the more important parts of a flight — which is, in part, why you never hear people applaud during takeoff. As such, the FAA, which regulates American air travel, and the FCC, which controls the use of our telecommunications spectrum, have found themselves at loggerheads over how, when and where 5G might be safely deployed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>5G is shorthand for 5th generation, referring to the latest standard for cellular service. First deployed in 2019, 5G operates on the same basis as its 4G predecessor — accessing the internet and telephone network via radio waves beamed at local cell antennas — but does so at broadband speeds up to 10Gb/s. However, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_band_(IEEE)">5G can operate on the C band spectrum</a>, there’s a chance that it can interfere with radio altimeters if within close proximity to airports, especially the older models lacking sufficient RF shielding.</p><p>“The fundamental emissions may lead to blocking interference in the radar altimeter receiver,” a 2020 study by <a href="https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SC-239-5G-Interference-Assessment-Report_274-20-PMC-2073_accepted_changes.pdf">aeronautics technical group RTCA</a>, observed. “The spurious emissions, on the other hand, fall within the normal receive bandwidth of the radar altimeter, and may produce undesirable effects such as desensitization due to reduced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), or false altitude determination due to the erroneous detection of the interference signal as a radar return.”</p><p>So when the FCC sold a range of C band in the 3.7 GHz to 3.98 GHz frequency range <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-winning-bidders-c-band-auction">last February for a cool $81 billion</a>, the airline industry under the umbrella of Airlines for America (which represents American Airlines, Delta, FedEx and UPS) <a href="https://www.5gtechnologyworld.com/5g-altimeter-interference-aviation-versus-telecoms/">took umbrage</a>. These concerns prompted the FAA to issue a warning about the issue <a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/dc7bd4f27e5f107486257221005f069d/27ffcbb45e6157e9862587810044ad19/%24FILE/AIR-21-18.pdf">last November</a> and led Verizon/AT&amp;T to push back their plans to launch 5G service on C Band by a month.</p><p>This warning, in turn, prompted the CTIA (the wireless industry’s main lobbying arm) to <a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com/">file its counterargument</a> shortly thereafter, asserting that <a href="http://v/">aircraft already safely fly into and out of</a> more than 40 countries that have broadly deployed 5G networks, such as Denmark and Japan. “If interference were possible, we would have seen it long before now,” CTIA President, Meredith Attwell Baker, insisted in a November <a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/5g-vs-air-safety-the-faas-false-choice/"><em>Morning Consult</em></a> op-ed.</p><p>However, those countries have also taken steps necessary to mitigate much of the potential issues, such as lowering the power of 5G cell towers, moving towers or simply pointing their receivers away from landing approaches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/807ad1b0-7975-11ec-bdda-a3ecb5b35e47" alt="it&#39;s a graph with lines and circles and a drawing of an antenna." data-uuid="f32c0336-939c-37a6-ad7b-2d128f9e2f97"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAA</div></figure><p>What’s more, a causal relationship between the 5G rollout and misbehaving altimeters has yet to be established.</p><p>&quot;The C-band is closer to the frequencies used by airplane altimeters than previous 5G deployments,&quot; Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponentia, told Tom’s Guide. &quot;In the US, the 5G we’ve been using has either been used before for prior wireless networks, or it is on really high frequencies with no ability to penetrate a piece of paper, let alone an airplane.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is a 200MHz buffer zone between C-band and altimeter frequencies, and the part of C-band that is opening up this week is even farther from that point,” he continued. “Additionally, similar frequencies are already in use in Europe with no problems observed. If the airplane’s altimeter filters are working properly, there should be no interference whatsoever.&quot;</p><p>Despite the CTIA’s efforts, the FAA (along with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg) in late December <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2021-12/12.31.2021%20-%20DOT%20and%20FAA%20Letter%20to%20ATT%20and%20Verizon%20.pdf">requested Verizon and AT&amp;T delay their primary rollout by two weeks</a>, starting on January 5th and extending to January 17th, to give the government time to <a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g">further investigate the issue</a>. Unsurprisingly, those complex issues were not resolved within the given time frame, causing the airline industry to look towards the supposedly falling heavens and Chicken Little even harder.</p><p>In a letter obtained by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Airlines for America argued the skies would be beset by utter “chaos” amid “catastrophic” failures if 5G were deployed, potentially stranding thousands of passengers overseas. &quot;Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded. This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays.&quot;</p><div id="30469a80dfcf4936af5a0ebb5b39ed8f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Full airline CEO letter <a href="https://t.co/NeXVJbFhzQ">https://t.co/NeXVJbFhzQ</a><a href="https://t.co/ws5Y5HKx1X">pic.twitter.com/ws5Y5HKx1X</a></p>— davidshepardson (@davidshepardson) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1483148794690740224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;We are writing with urgency to request that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate two miles of airport runways as defined by the FAA on January 19, 2022,&quot; the airline CEOs leaders argued. &quot;To be blunt, the nation&#39;s commerce will grind to a halt.&quot; The airlines also objected to potential incurred costs related to better shielding their avionics (which helped alleviate the previous issues with hearing aids).</p><p>For its part, United Airlines told <em>Reuters</em> that it faces &quot;significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities like Houston, Newark, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.&quot; That’s about 4 percent of the carrier’s daily traffic. These restrictions would apply to cargo aircraft as well as passenger planes, which will likely further exacerbate the nation’s current supply chain woes.</p><p>The FAA has conceded that 5G cellular technology could potentially cause issues but stopped short of the airline industry’s apocalyptic predictions. “Aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed,” the agency said in a statement, directing airlines that operate Boeing 787s, for example, to take extra precautions when landing on wet or snowy runways as 5G interference could prevent the massive airfcraft’s thrust reversers to fail, leaving it to stop using brake power alone.</p><p>AT&amp;T is none too happy with the FAA’s course of action either. &quot;We are frustrated by the FAA&#39;s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it to do so in a timely manner,&quot; an AT&amp;T spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>The FAA is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html">already considering the airlines’ request for buffer zones</a> and, on January 8th, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf">released a list of 50 airports</a> across the country where it plans to implement them. The agency also notes that it has cleared five models of radio altimeter to operate within low-visibility areas where 5G systems operate. These models are installed in more than 60 percent of aircraft flying in the US including the Boeing 737 - 777, Airbus’ A310 - A380, and the MD-10/-11.</p><p>&quot;We recognize the economic importance of expanding 5G, and we appreciate the wireless companies working with us to protect the flying public and the country’s supply chain. The complex U.S. airspace leads the world in safety because of our high standards for aviation, and we will maintain this commitment as wireless companies deploy 5G,&quot; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>This leaves the FAA in a tight spot. With the two week delay having already expired, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-c-band-5g-rollout-182958225.html">Verizon is moving ahead with its 1,700-city, 100 million-customer rollout</a>. AT&amp;T is doing so as well, though on a more limited basis in select parts of eight metro areas including Detroit, Chicago, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. The agency has pledged to continue to investigate the issue and regulate based on its findings though it has not yet disclosed what steps it plans to take next for doing so.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/5-g-rollout-faa-airlines-carriers-c-band-143026349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a28be2f-1e48-4ff9-abbd-9fcd5c27fafb</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:30:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642697273</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T16:48:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43a4c400-7932-11ec-9fce-20910f055bf4" width="4000" height="2557" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43a4c400-7932-11ec-9fce-20910f055bf4" width="4000" height="2557" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[5G words and an airplane toy are placed on a printed U.S. flag in this illustration taken January 18, 2022.

The Android 11-powered Sikur One, which was developed with the help of Brazilian manufacturer Multilaser, follows the Zero Trust approach to security.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/">Zero Trust concept</a> is, in a nutshell, self explanatory. It assumes that no one can fully be trusted from a security perspective. A company or organization typically has control over a Zero Trust setup, which requires users to be authorized, authenticated and continuously validated for them to retain access to apps and data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Sikur One is designed primarily for corporate and government use, with organizations having the ability to control each device in line with their policies. Sikur says the device is compliant with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr/">European GDPR</a> and Brazilian LGPD data privacy standards.</p><p>Using a system called <a href="https://www.sikur.com/solutions/passwordless-authentication/">Sikur ID</a>, the Sikur One can carry out a password-less authentication token function. The company says that will prevent malware and phishing attacks. The phone can be locked or wiped remotely if it&#39;s lost or stolen. Users can restore data from the cloud on another device.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4ef84aa0-78a3-11ec-a9ad-3f8ffc0cde82" alt="Sikur One" data-uuid="df48445f-4132-376f-926d-215cae2b6500"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sikur</div></figure><p>Data is encrypted at the source Users won&#39;t be able to install apps from unsecured third-party stores and Sikur One will switch off location services by default. The company will strip out unneeded system applications, while the Sikur One will be up to date with over-the-air patches. The company says that won&#39;t leave &quot;any room for commonly exploited vulnerabilities.&quot; There&#39;s no USB file transfer support either.</p><p>The Sikur One uses Sikur Messenger as the standard communication platform, encompassing messaging, file storage, file sharing and voice and video calls. All data is stored in a private cloud.</p><p>Despite the security measures, Sikur CEO Fabio Fischer says the smartphone has &quot;the same usability as a regular device.&quot; The Sikur One has access to all apps on the Google Play Store, but the organization in charge of the device can determine what kinds of apps can be downloaded or whether users can install their own apps at all.&nbsp;</p><p>On the hardware side, the Sikur One has a 6.5-inch screen, an octo-core processor, 4GB of memory and 128GB of onboard storage (which is expandable by up to 512GB using a memory card). It has a 4,000 mAh battery and dual SIM support, as well as 4G, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The device has a triple camera array on the rear and a 3MP front-facing lens. In addition, there&#39;s a fingerprint sensor and support for facial recognition.</p><p>Sikur One builds on the company&#39;s previous handsets, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-12-archos-sikur-granitephone.html">GranitePhone</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-sikurphone-encrypted-data-cryptocurrency-pre-order.html">SikurPhone</a>, which it released in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Although those were also intended for organizations, consumers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-07-sikur-granitephone-secure-encrypted-smartphone.html">still buying the GranitePhone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sikur will offer its latest model to the public as well via its sales channel partners. Pricing varies by country, but the Sikur One costs around $274. That covers the cost of the device as well as a one-year license for Sikur Messenger and mobile device management. After the first 12 months, organization will need to pay $145 per user per year for those features.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sikur-one-android-11-smartphone-zero-trust-multilaser-140031318.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">798b3829-d2b2-497d-ba73-0a65944b2ee1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642628005</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T21:33:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1bdf8ac0-78a3-11ec-b7f9-f36723560b46" width="999" height="699" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1bdf8ac0-78a3-11ec-b7f9-f36723560b46" width="999" height="699" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sikur]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A hand balancing the Sikur One smartphone on one corner.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sikur One]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon one-day sale knocks up to 40 percent off Anker chargers and accessories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can grab a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:bunch of Anker accessories" href="https://amzn.to/357pPJP">bunch of Anker accessories</a> from Amazon for up to 40 percent off just for today only.

The change appears to have happened over the past few days.</p><p>I’m based in the UK, where Apple has long required proof through the UNiDAYS platform to nab that often substantial discount on some of the company’s priciest devices. For legitimate students and teachers, you’ll have to click through to the UNiDAYS&#39; partner page for Apple first and sign in before you get to those discounts. Not that anyone can go too crazy: shoppers are limited to one desktop, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads and two accessories per year.

He said his team detected unauthorized transactions made from the accounts, but that they&#39;d fixed the issue immediately and fully reimbursed the affected users. Now, the company has <a href="https://crypto.com/product-news/crypto-com-security-report-next-steps">published</a> a report revealing details from its post mortem. Apparently, 483 accounts were affected and the unauthorized withdrawals totaled 4,836.26 ETH, 443.93 BTC and approximately $66,200 in other currencies.

At least 4,600 of the coins lost were Ethereum, and half of them are reportedly being washed — a process that obfuscates a coin&#39;s transaction trail. Meanwhile, Bitcoin research firm OXT Research said the company&#39;s loss might be worth <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-com-breach-may-be-worth-up-to-33m-suggests-onchain-analyst">up to $33 million</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report explained that the company&#39;s risk monitoring systems detected unauthorized activity a few days ago, wherein transactions were being approved without two-factor authentication for a small number of accounts. As a result, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1482936866001207296">paused</a> withdrawals on the evening of January 16th. Indeed, people in the comments on its Twitter announcement revealed that they had funds stolen even if they had 2FA enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>In another <a href="https://twitter.com/Kris_HK/status/1483277350683185155">tweet</a> posted on January 17th, Marszalek said that &quot;no customer funds were lost,&quot; the company&#39;s infrastructure was down 14 hours and that his team strengthened its security in response to what happened. The report expounded on that last part, revealing that Crypto.com revoked all customer 2FA tokens and implemented additional security measures that required all account users to re-log-in. The company said the move is necessary, because it migrated to a completely new 2FA infrastructure. However, it intends to eventually move away from 2FA and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).</p><p>Crypto.com has also introduced an additional security measure that requires users to wait 24 hours before they can withdraw to a newly registered whitelisted address. Finally, the company is launching the Worldwide Account Protection Program (WAPP) on February 1st for users who want additional protection for their funds.&nbsp;</p><p>WAPP can restore up to $250,000 of a participating user&#39;s money in case a third-party gains access to their account. That said, to qualify for the program, users must enable multi-faction authentication on all transaction types and not be using a jailbroken device. To be able to recoup their funds under the program, they must&#39;ve set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days before an unauthorized transaction, file a police report and provide Crypto.com a copy, as well as complete a questionnaire to support forensic investigation.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cryptocom-loses-34-million-hack-110519248.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5347e64-0ec6-45fa-9c46-f3b41e30dacf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 11:05:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642674625</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T10:30:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Australia International News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/58d89ba0-ac94-11eb-97ff-061055b60fc4" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/58d89ba0-ac94-11eb-97ff-061055b60fc4" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jpgfactory via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[izmir, Turkey - January 12, 2018 Close up ethereum coin with other crypto coins shot in black background in studio]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[cryptocurrency: ethereum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is opening its first physical clothing store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-reimagines-in-store-shopping-with-amazon-style">opening</a> its first-ever Amazon Style physical clothing store with the promise of a high-tech shopping experience, confirming a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-department-store-plans-reportedly-include-high-tech-dressing-rooms-123535220.html">rumor from last year</a>.

It strongly resembles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R5</a> mirrorless camera, but has a big hump in back to accommodate an active cooling system. As such, it offers most of the benefits of the EOS R5 with none of the overheating issues when shooting 8K or high frame rate 4K video.&nbsp;</p><p>On the video side, the EOS R5C can shoot 8K at up to 60fps in Canon&#39;s 12-bit RAW LT format using the entire width of the sensor, a big step up from the 8K 30p RAW available on the R5. Better still, it can work at that setting &quot;indefinitely,&quot; while the R5 is limited to just 20 minutes at 8K 30p due to overheating issues. It can also handle RAW 5.9K/60p with a Super 35mm crop, 2.9K/120p with a Super 16 crop, and 4K at up to 120 fps with no crop and full AF capability.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1eb9fe77-e973-4f97-82a7-f92438c1b8d9"/><p>It also supports ProRes RAW output to an external recorder via the HDMI port at up to 8K/30P. &quot;Proxy data can also be simultaneously recorded to an SD card in-camera, helping to provide efficient post-production operations,&quot; Canon said. Unfortunately, it uses micro HDMI rather than a full-sized port — not ideal for a dedicated cinema camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the R5, however, the R5C doesn&#39;t have in-body stabilization — so any optical shake reduction for stills or video will only be available via supported lenses. However, the optical lens stabilization can work in concert with Canon&#39;s electronic stabilization, with a 1.1x image crop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/334449e4-79ce-11ec-b5ef-64c639f9e851" alt="Canon EOS R5C cinema camera press images" data-uuid="e1a20b3d-a0b8-35ff-aa40-b416f95e9a68"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>There&#39;s one other notable limitation. Because the EOS R5C uses the same LP-E6NH batteries as the R5, it doesn&#39;t have enough power to operate the lens mount in certain video modes (8K and 5.9K above 30p and 2.9K Super 16 above 60fps). That means you lose autofocus at those settings on battery power only, though you can get it back by using external power from Canon&#39;s PD-E1 USB power supply or its new DC coupler.&nbsp;</p><p>On the photography side, the full-frame 45-megapixel sensor is a big plus, as is the 20 fps shooting speed in electronic shutter mode (12 fps with the mechanical shutter). It uses Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel autofocus system for both stills and video, along with eye/face detection and subject tracking, so it should offer the same excellent AF performance as the R5. When you flip the camera over to photo mode, all the menus and button settings change accordingly.&nbsp;</p><div id="7dea17a322d34683ac19abf4fb95e485"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eCQ1cqxvur4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It comes with a 3.2-inch variable-angle flip out LCD monitor and 5.76 million-dot viewfinder, the same as the EOS R5. While you get Canon Log 3 for improved dynamic range, the superior Log 2 option found on other Canon cinema cameras isn&#39;t available. Other features include dual card slots (one CFexpress and one SD UHS-II), animal eye detection (cats, dogs, or birds), vehicles detection, a multifunction shoe for microphones and other accessories, a timecode terminal for multi-cam shoots and a DC coupler to provide continuous power.</p><p>The EOS R5C will arrive in March for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:$4,499" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/AoAV5N">$4,499</a>, a $600 premium over the R5. It&#39;s a pretty interesting model as it can do more than some Canon cinema camera models for a lot less money and is much smaller, to boot. At the same time, it might give photo/video hybrid shooters serious pause if they&#39;re looking to buy Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">$6,500 A1 hybrid</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canons-eos-r-5-c-offers-8-k-video-and-45-megapixel-photos-with-no-cooling-issues-090819863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce25dd8f-3906-4353-a9ee-b9c96ca6da36</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 09:08:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642685543</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T13:32:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/95cf3e90-79c8-11ec-bdff-962f30bfa2da" width="2100" height="1316" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/95cf3e90-79c8-11ec-bdff-962f30bfa2da" width="2100" height="1316" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's EOS R5C offers 8K video and 45-megapixel photos with no cooling issues]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's EOS R5C offers 8K video and 45-megapixel photos with no cooling issues]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Shenmue' anime premieres February 5th on Crunchyroll]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <em>Shenmue</em> anime series is almost here, over a year after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shenmue-anime-crunchyroll-004323457.html">announced</a> at the Virtual Crunchyroll Expo.

It also received a Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certificate in Europe, allowing patients and medical staff to use the device more widely. Finally, it&#39;s taken a step closer to personal exoskeletons with additional funding.</p><p>The last time I saw Wandercraft&#39;s first-generation exoskeleton was over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-wandercraft-exoskeleton-paraplegic-help-walk.html">four years ago</a>, which is ages in the field of robotics. However, I recently got a chance to see the latest model in use with paraplegic patients, and chat with them and the team behind Atalante.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-04-mind-controlled-robotic-exoskeleton-paralysis.html">Exoskeletons</a> (or exos, as they&#39;re called in the industry) are powered &quot;wearable robots&quot; adapted to each user, designed to aid in walking rehabilitation treatments and restore a patient&#39;s mobility. Atalante is Wandercraft&#39;s second-generation exo with a more advanced design and features than the original model. It comes with a remote to operate it and a new app that lets a physiotherapist and patient fine tune movements and exercise programs. It uses two sets of removable batteries that allow for continuous use.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f39e80-7973-11ec-b3f9-55ea665fbcd3" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="de656013-2588-3a69-991a-6ac01bc3ca1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The latest model is much smaller, more streamlined and more comfortable for patients, thanks to new hardware, tweaks in the fit and more intelligent software. It&#39;s now self balancing, so it&#39;s easier to control for both patients and physiotherapists. Although it&#39;s not yet approved to be used alone, Wandercraft showed me a video demonstrating that it can self balance, even when shoved off kilter. It also offers features that make it easier to get in and out, along with the &quot;Wander Balance&quot; feature that allows for easy &quot;verticalization&quot; to help the patient stand up.</p><p>&nbsp;The device automatically generates optimized and adjustable kinematics according to a each patient&#39;s morphology, with the settings allowing for custom exercises. The latest feature is &quot;RealGait&quot; (shown above) which allows for physiological walking with adjustable speeds. &quot;CustomGait&quot; allows the pace, step length and mass center to be changed, while &quot;ActiveGait&quot; lets the user change the assistance effort from 0 to 100 percent. That feature also includes an &quot;EarlyGait&quot; setting for first steps, along with the new RealGait setting.&nbsp;</p><iframe src="https://www.yahoo.com/wandercraft-gait-video-073827881.html?format=embed&amp;region=US&amp;lang=en-US&amp;site=engadget&amp;player_autoplay=false" width="640" height="360" data-yom-embed-source="{media_id_1:70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68}" data-yahoo-uuid="70e530b0-f9d6-3361-8835-180ea0d3db68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" scrolling="no" id="4b27c583c1f247879c8dcd543efd6ec2"></iframe><p>Those features, plus smaller changes make Atalante far more useful. &quot;We&#39;ve  improved half turns so they happen on a spot rather than taking up a lot of space,&quot; Wandercraft CEO Matthieu Masselin told me. &quot;We&#39;ve redesigned things like the attachments and padding. That allows the patient to get in an out more quickly, move more comfortably and get more walking done in each session — which means more rehabilitation and re-education benefits.&quot;</p><p>All of that is enabled by numerous sensors and software that can make adjustments on the fly, Wandercraft told me. The device&#39;s &quot;sense of balance&quot; makes the various gait patterns possible, while also giving the patient and physiotherapist confidence that the device (which is still not light at 130 pounds) won&#39;t tip over.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2c68130-7974-11ec-a7bb-3295c210c454" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="1e0006aa-b782-3954-b642-3ca5bfa4956a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Wandercraft allows some patients to use Atalante for rehabilitation purposes and I saw it in action with Arbiha, a paraplegic patient who has used it for multiple sessions. The device was suspended from the ceiling and operated by a physiotherapist for safety reasons, but the plan is to one day have a version that can be used in the real world without assistance.&nbsp;</p><p>It was striking how easily she was able to walk during a relatively long one hour session. The exo therapy offers some clear benefits like stimulation of the cardiovascular/lymphatic systems and training for the arms and other supporting muscles, but it goes well beyond that.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adfa7690-7975-11ec-b1be-062b929303aa" alt="Wandercraft Atalante exoskeleton" data-uuid="6bd890d5-7c1c-36f9-b331-30db02925292"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;It boosts both my body and my spirits,&quot; Arbhia told me. &quot;It gives me a cardiovascular workout that I couldn&#39;t get otherwise. Being upright for a fairly long period of time helps my balance, too, as you lose that aspect when you don&#39;t stand up. I have a digestive malady and the walking therapy has also helped stabilize that, which is something I didn&#39;t expect at all.&quot;</p><p>Wandercraft&#39;s eventual goal is a personal exoskeleton that can be used as an assistance device at home or in the streets. To that end, the company just received $45 million in financing to help it fulfill that &quot;mobility for all&quot; mission. &quot;With the team we have, the financing we&#39;ve received and the deeptech technology developed, we&#39;re confident that we can one day have our exos on the streets and in people&#39;s homes,&quot; said Masselin. &quot;But we still have a lot of work to do.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wandercrafts-latest-exoskeleton-has-a-more-natural-gait-060009831.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e60c2714-e2a4-4610-8357-0e4e5d2d1de6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 06:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642697134</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T16:45:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57e437e0-7958-11ec-95b3-9755dee16e98" width="2100" height="1414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57e437e0-7958-11ec-95b3-9755dee16e98" width="2100" height="1414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wandercraft's latest exoskeleton helps paraplegics walk with a more natural gait]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wandercraft's latest exoskeleton helps paraplegics walk with a more natural gait]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="" medium="video"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wandercraft Gait Video]]></media:title><media:embed><![CDATA[]]></media:embed></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Consumer Reports now rewards driver monitoring, but only Ford and GM pass muster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With more automakers including driver assistance systems in their cars, <em>Consumer Reports </em>is changing how it grades those vehicles. Starting this year, the outlet will add an additional two points to a car’s overall score if its included driver assistance system encourages safe driving. Moving forward, it will also deduct points from a vehicle’s total score if it finds the opposite is true, starting with two points in 2024 and then four points in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>“We believe it&#39;s time to recognize vehicles that have found a safer way to deploy this technology,” said Jake Fisher, senior director of the publication’s Auto Test Center. By its own estimation, <em>Consumer Reports</em> says an adequate driver monitoring system is one that will “reliably” detect when the driver has become inattentive and alert them to that fact. It adds the system should escalate those warnings and eventually stop the car if it finds they’re not responding.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Consumer Reports</em> said it would also take into account an automaker’s privacy policy when evaluating a driver monitoring system, and may not award additional points in some instances.

The outlet said BMW, Ford, GM, Tesla and Subaru all claim their systems can detect and prevent driver inattention, but notes it found some “serious flaws” in those systems through its testing.</p><p>Beyond mentioning the automaker, <em>Consumer Reports</em> didn’t call out Tesla specifically, but the two have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-21-tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-recommendation.html"><ins>adversarial history</ins></a>.

CONCACAF (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) has <a href="https://www.concacaf.com/news/concacaf-to-use-var-in-multiple-competitions-in-2022/">revealed</a> it will use VAR to help refs in numerous 2022 competitions.

Soccer already has plenty of drama over tackles and handballs, they argue — VAR just draws out those disputes and takes away from the thrill of the game.</p><p>However, the arguments against the system appear to have lost some momentum. VAR helped reverse 17 out of 20 bad calls during the 2018 World Cup, and some backers have contended that video reviews would have overturned other mistakes if they had been used more consistently.

The dual-motor trailer not only reduces the burden on the towing vehicle, but can be remote-controlled from your phone to help you hitch up, reverse or simply move your camp site. You can even use the motors to shift the weight distribution, so you might not need a special hitch to handle certain trailer loads.</p><p>The other concept, the Thor Vision Vehicle, is a Ford Transit-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electric-brands-ebussy-194041042.html">electric RV</a>. The design is conventional, but Thor teased a &quot;best in class&quot; 300-mile range along with a digital cockpit that includes extensive tools to find chargers along your route.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no mention of whether or not the eStream or TVV will lead to ready-to-buy models, let alone timeframes for production. However, it&#39;s easy to see both reaching customers. Campers and other trailers significantly limit the range of any towing vehicle, and often demand extra power. While an electric camper like the eStream would have its own challenges (the weight and wear of its batteries, for instance), it could limit the overall impact on range and make towing an option for vehicles that would normally struggle.</p><div id="93ff81f3e58b4a2786384fe24442c459"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSzwMGXKthQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airstream-electric-camper-estream-concept-211006027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">453388ec-3df8-4240-a973-ae1f9e7e4184</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 21:10:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642693096</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T15:38:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d3b5c420-7a06-11ec-9eff-1a16fd45a011" width="1920" height="1250" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d3b5c420-7a06-11ec-9eff-1a16fd45a011" width="1920" height="1250" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Airstream eStream electric concept camper parked on the grass by a tree line with a couple sitting outside of it in camping chairs.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airstream eStream electric concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nanoleaf has stopped selling its original wall tiles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nanoleaf is retiring the product that made it into a household name.

But many challenges, from designing cars that can easily hold the fuel, to setting up reliable hydrogen distribution, have made it difficult to turn that dream into a reality. But what if you used those fuel cells to set up a remote EV charging station, or to replace a traditional gas or diesel generator for a large camp? That&#39;s what GM is planning to do with its HYDROTEC fuel cell technology, the <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0119-hydrotec.html">company announced today</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de0-7965-11ec-8391-9e184bc110b3" style="height:1316;width:2000;" alt="GM fuel cell mobile power generator" data-uuid="d8ffca3e-d770-31a7-9ee2-86c167f2dc00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GM</div></figure><p>GM&#39;s Mobile Power Generators, or MPGs, are pretty self descriptive: they&#39;d basically let you bring large amounts of electricity anywhere without burning fossil fuels, or expanding a local power grid. It could be useful for concerts, movie sets, or neighborhoods that frequently lose power. (In my town outside of Atlanta, almost everyone owns a gas generator to deal with storm-related outages.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement also makes plenty of sense for GM, as it&#39;s already bringing its fuel cell technology to <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/0127-navistar.html">trucking</a>, <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0617-hydrotec.html">aerospace</a> and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0615-wabtec.html">rail partners</a>. The company says the MPGs will be able to spit out 60 to 600 kilowatts without producing much noise or heat.</p><p>GM plans to show off an MPG-powered EV charging station in the middle of 2022, a project co-funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the U.S. Army. Additionally, the California Energy Commission is exploring how MPGs could help provide energy during power shutdowns. GM is also working together with Renewable Innovations to build the EMPOWER rapid charger, which could deliver fast EV charging to existing stations without the need for huge infrastructure improvements. Taking things to an even more extreme level, there&#39;s a large MPG implementation that could potentially power large military camps and heavy-duty equipment. (And as a bonus, those camps can actually use the water the MPG emits.)</p><p>While it&#39;ll likely be years before MPGs can actually deployed, it&#39;s heartening to see GM explore uses for fuel cells outside of cars. Battery-powered EVs have evolved so quickly that hydrogen-powered cars don&#39;t have much of a future (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-second-generation-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-060056654.html">sorry, Toyota</a>).

The notice sets firmer requirements, both for schedules and for the technology needed to lock down government data.</p><p>The memo lets the NSA require agencies to take &quot;specific actions&quot; in response to threats and security flaws, and asks the NSA to coordinate with Homeland Security on directives. Agencies will also have to identify their national security systems, report incidents and secure tools that transfer data between classified and unclassified systems. The President&#39;s move also sets timelines and guidance for implementing technologies required in the executive order, ranging from encryption to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Biden&#39;s move complements an order that was initially signed in response to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-captures-hacker-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-012541371.html">critical infrastructure cyberattacks</a>. In theory, this will tighten security at some of the most sensitive federal government institutions. As with the order, though, the memo can only accomplish so much without Congress&#39; support.
