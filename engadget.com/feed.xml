Apple&#39;s subtle refinement on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12 models</a> will be familiar if you&#39;ve paid attention to developments in the Android world. Some of the changes are impressive, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-mini-annoucement-175051051.html">bringing the iPhone 12 Pro Max&#39;s excellent camera hardware to smaller phones and lower price points</a>. Others, like a slightly smaller notch, bigger batteries, brighter displays, faster chips and expanded 5G support feel incremental. Still, they add up to make the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 feel like worthwhile upgrades, especially to those looking to upgrade from older iPhones.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>If you’re coming from an iPhone 12 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-mini-review-cameras-battery-life-002700754.html">12 mini</a>, you might not notice a huge difference in this year’s models. The physical refinements include a smaller notch, a rearranged camera module that protrudes slightly further than before along with a new pink color option. I <em>adore</em> this hue — it’s similar to the “Not Pink” shade Google used on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-review-android-pie.html">the Pixel 3</a>, but because of the glass covering the iPhone, it looks paler and more iridescent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple shaved 20 percent off the front camera notch, which is nice, but it’s still significantly larger than the punch-hole designs over in Android land. The smaller size also didn’t make a huge difference in daily use. Of course, that notch houses hardware for Face ID, which is more sophisticated than any punch-hole camera at the moment. Given there isn’t a fingerprint sensor on current iPhones, a beefier face-recognition system is warranted and I guess we’ll just have to put up with the notch until Apple can figure out a better approach.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" alt="A green iPhone 12 and pink iPhone 13 with their backs facing the camera. You can see their dual cameras. On the left, the pair of sensors are stacked on top of each other. On the right, they&#39;re laid out diagonally. The module on the right is also slightly wider and taller, and the cameras themselves are slightly bigger." data-uuid="6ae5cc3c-5d62-32e7-9c10-c53ae98ea06e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The main way to tell the iPhone 13 and its predecessor apart is by looking at the camera module. Instead of stacking the pair of lenses vertically, Apple laid them diagonally. The bump is also a little bigger and thicker and the extra wobbling this causes is mildly annoying. Also, this does mean your old iPhone 12 cases won’t fit.</p><p>Otherwise, the iPhone 13 and 13 mini are physically very similar to last year’s models. They both feature anodized aluminum and glass frames with flat edges with what Apple calls its “ceramic shield” covering the front.</p><p>Both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini are a hair heavier and thicker and have the same display sizes as before at 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch respectively. The iPhone 13 is heavier than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">the Galaxy S21</a>, too, despite having a smaller screen. Though, its density, glass covering and shiny metal edges do make it feel more premium.</p><h2>Display and audio</h2><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">the iPhone 13 Pros</a>, which have faster 120Hz screens, the iPhone 13 and 13 mini have similar displays to their predecessors. Apple says the panels are 28-percent brighter. When I set the iPhone 12 and 13 to max brightness and held them up on a cloudy day, I did notice the newer phone had a <em>teensy</em> bit of an edge. But the difference isn’t big enough that you’d know without having them side by side.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d9c17f40-1a9c-11ec-a7fe-48c24f72b711" alt="A black iPhone 13 mini and pink iPhone 13 standing in front of some books on a shelf, with their rears facing the camera." data-uuid="e86fedf7-e436-30ce-9db0-6ff3437eaa45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Besides that, the iPhone 13’s screens haven’t changed much. The thing is that just about everywhere else you look, though, phone displays are faster. I had been using the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 before reviewing the iPhone 13, and even Google’s 90Hz panels make browsing Twitter and Reddit feel smoother.</p><p>If you’ve only used a 60Hz screen so far, you might not feel like you’re missing much — the iPhone 13’s display is still vibrant and crisp. You’ll enjoy watching Instagram or TikTok videos, for sure. But as someone who’s experienced the <em>good stuff</em>, I can tell you that you’re missing out.</p><p>As for the iPhone 13’s speakers, they’re basically unchanged and are good enough to hear the voices in your favorite creators’ clips or the background music of YouTube videos. In a pinch, they’ll even do a decent job streaming your favorite songs, offering clear vocals and adequate bass. As expected, though, the bigger iPhone is louder and has a fuller sound than the mini.</p><section data-eng-breakout="8060db32f426485ba9ee6c7e29bb99de" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/faa6ab90-1a9c-11ec-b4d7-57fcd5c37c64" alt="A pink iPhone 13 nestled in a planter with its rear cameras facing us."></section><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The bulk of the iPhone 13 and 13 mini’s upgrades are around photography and video. Apple improved both the rear sensors here and the ultrawide lens is supposed to let in more light than before. Sadly, a lot of the notable additions are contingent on the A15 chipsets, meaning things like Cinematic Mode won’t be coming to older iPhones.</p><p>For example, the faster image signal processor (ISP) on the chip means things like nighttime photos won’t take as long. I certainly didn’t have to hold the iPhone 13 still for as many seconds as the iPhone 12 when I used both of them to shoot a candlelit globe in a super dark room. The difference was probably about one second, which sounds insignificant, but can feel like forever when you’re struggling to remain motionless.</p><p>The ultrawide photos I shot with the new phone were actually darker than the iPhone 12’s, but they were better exposed overall. Buildings against the night sky had cleaner lines, less noise and a more neutral tone than those from the iPhone 12. Google’s Night Sight on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">the Pixel 5</a> still rendered more details in the shadows, though, and I preferred the cooler images it produced.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f42ec70-1a9d-11ec-bbb2-7ce8373cec4b" alt="Photographic styles on the iPhone 13" data-uuid="652d0bcf-2a38-3746-9df8-e3faa7667b7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>I used to prefer photos from Pixels because Apple’s pictures had a yellowish tinge. But with the iPhone 13s, Apple is introducing a way to better match users’ individual preferences called Photographic Styles. It’ll let you choose from one of five profiles: Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm and Cool, which differ in contrast levels and color temperature.</p><p>You can tweak these modes to your preference, too. But at their original settings, my favorite Style was Vibrant. Unlike filters, this felt more like a set-and-forget kind of thing — nice for people like me who have never been into Apple’s default treatment. Overall, the iPhone 13 took colorful and crisp shots, though compared to Google’s images they were needlessly brighter with obvious HDR effects.</p><p>In addition to the hardware and software improvements I’ve already mentioned, the company also updated its HDR algorithm to better accommodate every person in the scene. It also worked to enhance video quality, promising better dynamic range, details and highlights. Plus, you can now record in Dolby Vision in 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second.</p><p>But the most intriguing new video feature (and arguably of all the camera updates) is Cinematic Mode. Using the A15 chip’s neural engine, the iPhone 13 can create a Portrait mode-like effect in your clips, keeping your selected subjects in focus while blurring out the rest of the scene. You can tap on parts of your viewfinder to change focal points as you shoot or let the iPhone decide for you by analyzing who and what’s in the scene.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/48836100-1a9d-11ec-969f-352c696d4e45" alt="Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13" data-uuid="14e351dc-dfc1-38bf-80e0-dc8eca243b45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>On its own, Apple’s system is pretty clever. The iPhone 13 did a great job of identifying faces (both human and canine) in my shots, and yellow or white boxes appeared to indicate potential things to focus on. As my subjects turned toward and away from the camera, they became clearer and blurrier respectively. But when I tried to exert more control and adjust the focal point, the system struggled. Sometimes, my intended subject remained blurry even after I tapped on its rectangle. Other times, the iPhone didn’t follow the person I selected after they walked behind an obstruction, though that’s a reasonable situation.</p><p>When it did perform as expected, Cinematic Mode produced a pleasant effect that gave videos a professional air. But at the default intensity, the blurriness looked strange or artificial. The outline of my colleague’s head was stark against the softened background and I had to adjust the F-stop to the highest (f/16) to get a more natural feel.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Cinematic Mode only works in 1080p at 30 frames per second, even if you’ve set your camera to record at a higher quality.</p><p>Cinematic mode is also available via the 12-megapixel selfie camera, which offers Photographic Styles too, and both features were just as effective via the front sensors as through the rear.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f3dc8fcc-6ed7-4dd9-ba82-5238ee93d825"/><p>In low light, the iPhone 13 took selfies that were slightly blurry compared to the Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21, but when I was well lit, Apple’s camera delivered images that were just as sharp as the competition. It even had a more neutral tone than the other two, with a more accurate white balance (though Samsung was pretty close).</p><h2>iOS 15</h2><p>I covered most of the changes coming via iOS 15 when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">I tested the beta</a>, including things like Focus modes and SharePlay. Focus modes, which lets you set custom home pages and notification profiles based on your location or time of day, is still one of the most useful new features on any smartphone platform in recent years. Meanwhile, SharePlay won’t be available until a later release.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcc02040-1a9d-11ec-b679-b593aac40b57" alt="An iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 next to each other with their screens facing the camera." data-uuid="0d3b3232-2d48-35ee-9cfd-deb1d2471b09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Each time you open a relevant app, like Photos or Tips, Apple shows you what’s new this time around — like Memories set to tunes from the company’s Music library. Safari also had a redesign (and a few tweaks during the beta window), primarily making it easier to browse and organize your tabs.</p><p>I’ve never been a big Safari user, preferring Chrome for its convenience, but it’s nice to see Apple update its interface for easier navigation with one hand. Chrome and Safari are pretty similar on iOS, although Google sadly still has its address and search bar at the top of the screen. If you prefer, you can also go back to the traditional layout in Safari.</p><p>Other noteworthy iOS updates include Live Text in Photos, which makes finding specific pictures from the Spotlight search much easier. The Maps and Weather apps also received a refresh, while Shared With You in Messages makes it slightly easier to find things you and your friends chatted about. Since most of these will be coming to older iPhones, though, iOS 15 features are unlikely to sway your decision on whether to upgrade this year.</p><p>We’ll have a more in-depth review of Apple’s latest OS soon, but for now, I’m pleased with the level of control iOS 15 offers and look forward to testing out a stable version of SharePlay.</p><section data-eng-breakout="8227b9ca170e46be9c25f9b7803eb6f1" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9349aeb0-1a9d-11ec-a7ef-e9f4d7e00ada" alt="A pink iPhone 13 slightly off angle, with its rear facing the camera."></section><h2>Performance and in use</h2><p>There are some annual updates that we take for granted nowadays, like imperceptibly faster processors and incrementally improved battery life. Though it’s not obvious, Apple says one of the iPhone 13’s key updates is an internal redesign that allows for a bigger battery, among other things. Also new in the A15 are the GPU, ISP and video encoder and decoder, which made using the camera super snappy. Oh, and it’s worth pointing out that Apple doubled the storage of the base iPhone 13, so you now get 128GB at the entry-level. <em>Finally</em>.</p><p>I spent most of my time on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini shooting pictures and video, browsing my feeds, shopping for completely unnecessary things, messaging my friends and completing round after round on the New York Times Crossword app. Every now and then, I had to wait for a page to load on the mini, while the bigger phone rarely lagged. I can’t tell if the delays I encountered had to do with my internet connection or if the smaller device was actually slower. Their scores on Geekbench 5 are about the same, so I suspect it was the former. Overall, though, both the iPhone 13s sped through tasks like launching and switching between multiple apps, snapping photos in rapid succession and uploading Instagram posts.</p><p>Frankly, the main thing holding both models back is the display. As mentioned, pretty much every other flagship phone has a faster screen now, and even the Pixel 5’s 90Hz panel feels noticeably faster. Whenever I reflexively started scrolling my list of Instagram Story viewers or Twitter timeline or pretty much anything on the internet, it felt like a drag on the new iPhones. I went right back to the Pixel 5 or iPhone 13 Pro any time I knew I was going to spend a long time scrolling.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Despite their brighter screens, Apple said the iPhone 13 and 13 mini should last up to 2.5 and 1.5 hours longer than their predecessors respectively. While the 13 mini did beat the 12 mini by sticking around almost a whole day on light use, the 13 hours and 19 minutes score on our video rundown test is still shorter than the average smartphone. It’s a pity; I love the size of the iPhone 13 mini — it’s just so much easier to use with one hand. But the greatest drawback of any modern phone this small is a lack of endurance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b629a40-1a9e-11ec-af7e-7c48791d7ea9" alt="A pink iPhone 13 on a mustard-colored couch with its rear facing the camera." data-uuid="d671fcc3-0c02-33d6-8e05-3af69df2b3bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPhone 13, meanwhile, outlasted its predecessor and generally hung around for almost two days. The Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21 also clocked similar runtimes — it’s nice that most flagships these days have fairly long-lasting batteries. I&#39;m still running our full battery tests across all of the new iPhones, including the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, and will update this review with comparative figures shortly.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>This is a story we’ve told over and over again, each time with the same conclusion: While this year’s iPhones aren’t major improvements over their predecessors, they offer just enough changes that might tempt you to upgrade, particularly if you’re still on an iPhone 11 or older. The iPhone 13 and 13 mini feel like they should have been called the 12s and 12s mini, thanks to a largely similar design and few major upgrades from the previous models. If you have an iPhone 12, you need to decide if the longer battery life and photography updates are worth however much the upgrade will cost you. Our review of the 13 Pro and Pro Max is coming later this week, so you can check that out to see if things like the faster displays and macro photography features would be worth picking up one of those.</p><p>As for how Apple’s latest compare to recent Android flagships, you’ll find they’re all almost on par when it comes to hardware. The biggest difference is the faster screens on Androids, and those who prefer fingerprint sensors to Face ID will only find them on non-Apple phones. Those are good reasons to stick with Android. But on software, Apple’s thoughtful approach with Focus modes and privacy on iOS makes it appealing to those who want greater control over how much of their lives they want to give up to their phones. Switching ecosystems will always be a struggle, and with the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, Apple has yet to give people a compelling reason to do so. But, as expected, they’re excellent phones with little to complain about.</p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with HDR</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,532 x 1,170 (460 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear dual cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.6 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 19 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.30 inches; 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.65mm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 174 grams; 6.14oz</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13 mini)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with HDR</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,340 x 1,080 (476 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear dual cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.6 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 17 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 5.18 x 2.53 x 0.30 inches; 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.65mm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 141grams; 4.97oz</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05d73a96-dac2-4fbc-95fb-a534e53a1ef4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632227392</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T12:29:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de2e6bc0-1a9b-11ec-bef7-5c6aa1cb549c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73f8c710-1ad6-11ec-b7dd-264bb5d27314" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13 and 13 mini.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 and 13 mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhites have bigger, brighter screens and USB-C charging]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As indicated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-next-kindle-5-may-come-in-a-signature-edition-with-more-storage-101549272.html">a leak earlier this week</a>, Amazon is updating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Kindle%20Paperwhite">Kindle Paperwhite</a>. The fifth-gen Paperwhite (which marks the first refresh in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">nearly three years</a>) has a larger, 6.8-inch display, compared with the previous model&#39;s six-inch screen.

The Kindle Paperwhite Kids is largely the same as the other two models in terms of design, though there are a bunch of child-friendly features. For one thing, there&#39;s a two-year worry-free guarantee. If it breaks in that time, Amazon will replace it.</p><p>There&#39;s audiobook and Bluetooth headphone support, as well as achievement badges and educational tools to foster literacy skills. The kids model, which is designed for readers aged seven and older, doesn&#39;t have internet access or any way for children to accidentally make any purchases. Their folks can manage the device using the Parent Dashboard.</p><p>Kindle Paperwhite Kids has funkier color options than the other two devices, which only come in black.

The HP Envy 34 All-in-One PC arrives in October 2021 starting at $1,999.

Among those is the rollout of its Stories-style feature, which will let users share <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-audio-143014019.html"><ins>audio, video and screen recordings</ins></a> in channels and direct messages. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-video-stories-anytime-audio-connect-dms-130051370.html"><ins>said last October</ins></a> it was experimenting with the idea.</p><p>Rather than sharing snippets from your life or whatever&#39;s on your mind (as you might on Instagram Stories), <a href="https://slack.com/digital-hq">Slack Clips</a> is more about sharing work updates. You might use them to share a briefing so colleagues in other timezones can catch up later, or to offer some feedback on a project without having to type out all of your thoughts. Clips could help teams avoid trying to find a time that everyone&#39;s available for a meeting and instead let folks watch recordings when it best suits them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Slack says it designed the feature with inclusivity and accessibility in mind. Along with changing the playback speed, you can read live, automated captions. You can also use a transcript to skip the preamble and get to the parts of the recording that truly matter, and respond to a Clip with text, audio or video. Unlike Stories on other platforms, Clips won&#39;t automatically disappear and the transcriptions will be searchable.</p><p>Slack is rolling out Clips now. The feature should be available to all paid teams this fall.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/79830260-170f-11ec-bf77-1d84c5422f66" style="height:542;width:829;" alt="Slack Connect" data-uuid="2883b2e8-f8df-31b9-a3e7-91538a0e9d49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slack</div></figure><p>One of the other things you can do with Clips is share them with people outside of your team through Slack Connect. That feature lets users interact with external partners and customers, and the company has some news on that front too. With Slack Connect sponsored connections, Enterprise Grid teams will be able to invite anyone else into channels, even if they aren&#39;t paid users.</p><p>Until now, only organizations on paid plans have been able to work in channels together through Slack Connect. (All users can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-connect-dm-change-190737764.html"><ins>DM each other</ins></a> regardless of what plan they&#39;re on.) The company suggests sponsored connections, named so because Enterprise Grid plans cover the cost of Connect, will help teams move forward with partners and customers faster. Enterprise Grid teams will have access to the feature this fall.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slack announced a version of the app for the public sector called GovSlack, which is designed to meet government security needs and certifications. GovSlack will be available next year.

At the same time, the company unveiled a new TikTok-esque app called Xiao Qu Xing (&quot;Little Fun Star&quot;), which offers short educational videos.</p><p>This is another fairly dramatic move as part of China’s broader crackdown on digital media and video games. Officials have recently described gaming as “spiritual opium” and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html"><ins>limited kids playtime to just three hours a week</ins></a>.</p><p>Chinese leaders are reportedly concerned that children are becoming addicted to video games, which is having a detrimental effect on their development. The science behind video game addiction is controversial and disputed, with research into the condition ongoing.</p><p>Either way, the changes to Douyin aren’t likely to be that wide ranging in isolation since it’s thought that less than half a percent of users are under 14.

They have reason to be concerned, according to a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521003791?via%3Dihub#!">MIT study</a> seen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The researchers studied glance data and found that drivers become more inattentive when using Tesla&#39;s Autopilot system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Visual behavior patterns change before and after [Autopilot] disengagement,” according to the study. “Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Visual behavior patterns change before and after AP disengagement. Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that drivers may not pay as much attention to the road when using Autopilot is not exactly a shocker. What&#39;s new is that the researchers were able to see exactly where drivers were looking when the autopilot was engaged versus when it&#39;s disengaged.</p><p>Off-road glances were directed downwards and toward the center stack region, so they &quot;were presumably non-driving related.&quot; Rather, looking in those directions is typically associated with activities like glancing down at a smartphone or interacting with the center-stack infotainment touchscreen. Those were often longer with Autopilot engaged and far more frequent than off-road glances in manual driving, according to the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the name, Tesla&#39;s FSD (full self-driving) Autopilot is merely a driver assist system and far from being fully autonomous.

The streaming service has launched a free tier in the country that offers around one-fourth the content available to paying subscribers. It has no ads and won&#39;t even ask for payment information upon sign-up — a new subscriber will only need to confirm they&#39;re over 18 and to type in their email address and password.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it does have limitations in addition to having a smaller selection: It&#39;s only accessible on an Android device and users won&#39;t be able to download episodes for offline viewing or to cast shows on movies to a TV. In the announcement post, Netflix&#39;s Director of Product Innovation Cathy Conk, said: &quot;If you’ve never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service.&quot; The company is hoping that the free tier would entice people to pay for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Netflix made some of its content free to access. Last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-original-content-collection-125616221.html">launched</a> a &quot;watch free&quot; page where people can stream original movies such as <em>Bird Box</em> and the first episodes of popular shows like <em>Stranger Things</em> without even having to log in. The free plan is new, though, and a spokesperson told <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/netflix-free-streaming-plan-kenya-1235069573/"><em>Variety</em></a> that it&#39;s launching first in Kenya as a way for the company to gather information on how effective it is in generating paying customers. Netflix has been investing more heavily in new markets to offset its slowing growth in the US and other saturated markets and amidst an increasing number of rival streaming services. Based on what the rep said, we may see the free tier make its way to more regions in the future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-tier-android-kenya-043616484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3646f197-281a-4257-8186-b00ad29d6534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 04:36:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632226166</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T12:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a04777f0-1ad4-11ec-9f9d-fab1eb8ee56e" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a04777f0-1ad4-11ec-9f9d-fab1eb8ee56e" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/08/27: In this photo illustration the Netflix logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

According to an investor note <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphone-14-pro-hole-punch-48mp-camera/"><ins>seen by </ins><em><ins>MacRumors</ins></em></a>, Kuo claims Apple will release three new iPhones in the second half of the year. The two high-end models will reportedly feature punch-hole display cutouts and a 48-megapixel primary camera. In other words, the expectation is that Apple will start moving away from the notch design that has defined its phones since the release of the iPhone X in 2017.</p><p>Moving to a 48-megapixel camera would also represent a significant change for the company. Recent iPhones have exclusively shipped with 12-megapixel primary cameras. By moving to a denser sensor, the company could use <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-pixel-binning-966179/"><ins>pixel binning technology</ins></a> to allow people to take high-resolution shots during the day and less noisy ones when the sun starts to set.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/kuo-iphones-with-under-screen-touch-id-now-coming-in-2023-foldable-iphone-in-2024/"><ins>Looking further ahead</ins></a>, Kuo said Apple plans to add an in-display fingerprint sensor to the iPhone in 2023. Previously, the analyst had predicted that would happen next year, but now notes a slower than expected development process has delayed Apple’s rollout of the feature. That’s a significant delay when you consider <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-223939578.html"><ins>early reports on the iPhone 13</ins></a> lineup had suggested those phones would include in-display fingerprint sensors. Similarly, he expects the company will release a foldable iPhone in 2024, where he had previously predicted we would see the device sometime in 2023. As always, take these reports with a grain of salt. Kuo has a decent but not flawless track record when predicting Apple releases.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ming-chi-kuo-apple-iphone-14-report-172030312.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af167258-2611-4429-a100-ab35fca35b5e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 17:20:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632157777</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T17:09:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7627a90-13da-11ec-a3ff-c372aa61c8d9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a7627a90-13da-11ec-a3ff-c372aa61c8d9" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max back]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max back]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15 is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is now rolling out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html"><ins>iOS 15</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html"><ins>iPadOS 15</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html"><ins>watchOS 8</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-airpods-max-spatial-audio-tvos-macos-180128777.html">tvOS 15</a> to iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and Apple TV devices.

(Lau said the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-2-5-g-impressions-release-date-price-144511154.html">Nord 2</a> already features an early version of the integrated codebase, so there&#39;s a good chance that it&#39;ll get the full upgrade.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef059810-1aa5-11ec-bef3-cb2ce1593c6a" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="OnePlus 9 Pro &#x00548c; Oppo Find X3 Pro" data-uuid="33690b06-5e93-39e4-bc81-3236505260b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Given that the shared OS would reduce differentiation between Lau&#39;s two brands, one might wonder which would more likely produce the &quot;perfect&quot; flagship smartphone? Never one to give a direct answer, Lau implied that he doesn&#39;t believe such a device would ever exist. He referred to an internal demographic map featuring 20 user categories, each of which tied to a combination of different needs — down to the level of product size, specific photography features, charging modes, weight and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Lau&#39;s basic definition of OnePlus users is &quot;tech enthusiasts,&quot; but he added that based on this mapping, it&#39;s still impossible to satisfy everyone&#39;s needs with a single device. As such, the exec thinks the market is big enough for his two brands to avoid friendly fire. For the same reason, OnePlus&#39; Nord line will continue to co-exist with the Oppo Reno series (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-flash-magdart-android-apple-magsafe-125551887.html">Realme</a>, for that matter), though the similarity of their designs is still questionable. (Lau insisted that each brand has a dedicated design team, even after the merger.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/beeb28b0-1a24-11ec-be5f-6929c604d6cc" alt="OnePlus founder Pete Lau" data-uuid="5380acb9-60bf-3d68-96b3-4b4563885a5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>Another area which OnePlus may benefit from the integration is photography. Lau pointed out that what used to be a camera team of around 100 people is now some 700, which may allow OnePlus to take better advantage of its relationship with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-hasselblad-xpan-film-camera-setting-update-120054895.html">Hasselblad</a>, especially with their ongoing work on color science this year. The exec added that he can&#39;t say OnePlus currently has the best camera performance, but he&#39;s certain that it&#39;s &quot;definitely&quot; among the top in the industry.</p><p>Lau admitted that with his expanded role, even if he had 48-hour days, it&#39;d still be impossible for him to personally pick on every single detail on every product like he did before (let&#39;s just say it&#39;d be unlikely that he&#39;d throw a fit over a minor design issue on a logic board, as he once <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-23-oneplus-one-launch-ceo-pete-lau-interview.html">famously</a> did back in his Oppo Blu-ray player days). Instead, Lau had been spending a lot of time teaching his &quot;never settle&quot; philosophy to his new Oppo teammates over the past year or so, in the hopes of changing what used to be a leader-driven mission to true team work. It&#39;ll be a while before we get a real taste of this fruition, but Lau is &quot;confident that this new unified OS won&#39;t disappoint.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-10-oppo-unified-android-operating-system-163038315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2600f01e-bdd7-47eb-a28d-190056be04d7</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 16:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632208195</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T07:10:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/78887b40-96a6-11eb-8df5-61842fe56da9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/78887b40-96a6-11eb-8df5-61842fe56da9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eric Chan / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro 評測]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro 評測]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Finch' trailer sees man, machine and dog try to flee climate change]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple offered a brief glimpse of the Tom Hanks-led <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tom-hanks-finch-release-date-085915154.html"><em>Finch</em></a> at its recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html">iPhone 13 launch event</a>, and now you can watch the first full trailer for the upcoming sci-fi film.

The Axon 30 is a direct sequel to the Axon 20, which was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-front-selfie-camera-140003878.html">first phone to feature an in-screen camera</a>. However, the company has subsequently released the Axon 30 Pro and Ultra in some territories. So, weirdly, the vanilla Axon 30 is the last of the Axon 30 family to appear.</p><p>At $500, it’s also the cheapest — another attempt by ZTE to slide underneath the priciest smartphones around and offer a mixture of compelling features, albeit tempered by some compromises. The Axon 30’s headline feature is a much-improved under-display camera (UDC), which is almost invisible. It’s also a ZTE smartphone that’s launching in the US, which doesn’t always happen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But with increasingly strong midrange phone competition from the likes of Samsung, OnePlus and Google, does ZTE’s Axon 30 offer more than just a hidden selfie camera?</p><p>So what’s all the fuss about that camera anyway? Well, the under-screen 16-megapixel selfie shooter on the $500 Axon 30 puts the one on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 to shame. ZTE’s implementation is imperceptible unless you really, really look for it. No punch hole, no notch, no pop-up camera.</p><p>In comparison, the Fold 3’s selfie cam has a pixelated effect that signposts where the camera is and ruins the whole effect. (Yes, in Samsung’s defense, there’s another front-facing camera on the Fold 3 when it’s closed and you’re using the smaller screen.)</p><p>The difference seems to be pixel density, or according to ZTE, the composition of them, with a “special pixel matrix” that ensures the screen appears at 400 PPI — double that found on the Axon 20. If the light catches the unit just right, then yes, you can see it. You’ll probably never notice it again.</p><p>There’s also a dedicated UDC chip that apparently works to keep the camera area looking consistent with the rest of the screen. To get a closer look, I used Oppo’s Find X3 Pro, which has a microscope phone camera — perfect for visually explaining what could otherwise get very technical.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1e4cce0-1643-11ec-bdff-65a10a81eed6" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="ecb3519d-46cf-33cf-be2f-dab8e0641e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>As you can see, some pixels seem slightly smaller, or dimmer, than those surrounding them. In this close up you can see the outline of the UDC area, but at this magnification, it’s impressive that it doesn’t look more out of place. I’ll touch on the camera’s performance later, but spoiler: While it might look the part, it’s not quite capable enough.</p><p>The hidden sensor also complements the expansive 6.92-inch AMOLED screen, uninterrupted by the presence of any camera notches or holes. With a 2,460 x 1,080 resolution panel and 120Hz refresh rate, the Axon 30 is offering a flagship screen for mid-range prices. You can switch between 120 and 60Hz modes, with an automatic option letting the Axon 30 decide when to increase the frequency. On more expensive phones, like the OnePlus 9 Pro and the recently-announced<a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html"> iPhone Pro 13</a>, there are more refresh rate options that dip even lower, but at this price, this seems like a fair compromise.</p><p>Leaving it on auto is probably the best fit for most folks, but the manual options are nice — especially as there seems to be a tangible battery life benefit to the lower setting.</p><p>The phone itself is pretty big but feels solid despite its plastic back. ZTE added a translucent reflective effect across the rear of the Axon 30, which I like. I’m less enamored with the giant camera unit, however, which protrudes a few millimeters from the phone, and is likely to be more easily dinged and scratched. Sadly, this design is now everywhere.</p><p>The screen might be comparable to a high-end phone, but there are some features that didn’t make the cut at this price, like wireless charging and certified resistance against dust and water.</p><p><strong>Performance and software</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1243e550-1571-11ec-a35e-0d3efbfffa54" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="e6fc0689-11b6-342b-9305-3211a1614f15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>There are further compromises. The Axon 30 is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 processor — which is a little underpowered compared to the Snapdragon 880 and 880 Plus we’re seeing in flagship Android smartphones now.</p><p>But at $500, phones like the Pixel 5a (and its Snapdragon 765G chip) are a better comparison to make. The Axon 30 has a more powerful chip than Google’s latest device, though it’s hard to notice a difference in performance between the two.</p><p>The Axon 30 handled everything I threw at it, whether that was video streaming, Stadia or playing games on the phone itself. (The Stadia app did flag that the phone wasn’t officially supported, although it worked fine for me.) There was some visible slowdown when recording video at full 4K resolution, and hopping into the gallery, but otherwise, I didn’t have many complaints.</p><p>I also have to mention that the Axon 30 isn’t exactly great for 5G support in the US. It only works on T-Mobile’s midband 5G. If you’re on Verizon or AT&amp;T, you’ll be relegated to 4G.</p><p>ZTE does know what it’s doing with smartphone power, though. The phone has a 4,200mAh battery that, when I turned the 120Hz refresh rate off, lasted a good two days of typical use before I needed to recharge. And when I did need to, it took hardly any time.</p><p>The Axon 30 supports incredibly fast charging speeds of up to 65W with the appropriate charger, which (thankfully) the phone comes with. ZTE estimates it can charge the phone to 100 percent in under an hour, but getting to 50 percent takes proportionately less time — around 20 minutes.</p><p>Software is pretty innocuous, which is generally a good thing. ZTE keeps pretty close to the stock Google experience. Its new MyOS 11 skin, based on Android 11, is pretty close to what you’d find on a Pixel. There are a few gesture quirks (shake the Axon 30 for the flashlight!) and a floating shortcut widget that can be minimized to the edges of the screen. It’s similar to Samsung’s Edge panel on its bigger phones. ZTE’s version is called Z-Pop and you can tweak the four shortcuts for system commands and app switching. That said, it’s not something that makes you think “Mmm what a memorable experience this is.”</p><p></p><h3>Cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124c97e0-1571-11ec-a75b-f4c08389583e" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="15b1c40a-7bb5-35cb-b408-cf9ce34ddafd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>While the front-facing 16-megapixel camera is technically impressive, it doesn’t take great selfies. Don’t get me wrong, it shoots far better pics than the UDC on both Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Axon 20. The work done to pixel-bin for low light performance, as well as algorithms to help the camera ‘see’ through the AMOLED panel make this the best UDC so far. But it still offers up middling to poor photos. It’s a bit of a time warp, to be honest, giving me the kind of pictures I used to get on smartphones years ago. Details are fuzzy, and any strong backlighting leads to lens flares and washout.</p><p>There’s also an AI assist mode that doesn’t seem to help much — if anything, modes like brightness seem to wash out skin tones even further, and they’re a little gray to begin with. Even if you turn this off, images seem pretty unnatural.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3d582710-1643-11ec-b766-ba2f99c72f3d" alt="ZTE Axon 30 samples" data-uuid="d27e495c-7fce-3801-bc61-5faf14aae13f"><figcaption>I couldn&#39;t mask how disappointed I was in these selfies.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>It does still capture enough detail to offer face unlock functionality if you prefer that method to fingerprint unlock. And yes, there’s also a fingerprint reader built into the screen. Face unlock worked fine for me nine times out of ten, and was plenty fast enough, but I used a combination of the two. Fingerprint unlock seemed more reliable in darker environments.</p><p>But what about the rest of the cameras? On the back, the Axon 30 has a four-camera array, led by a 64-megapixel Sony sensor. While you’ll mostly be taking pictures that fuse a lot of these pixels together for less noise and better performance in low-light, ZTE has kept the ability to take full-resolution stills if you want to. There’s also an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 5-megapixel macro camera and finally, a 2-megapixel depth sensor to aid your bokeh photography efforts and help with focus. You get up to 2x optical zoom, which is what you’d generally expect at this price point.</p><p>While shooting pictures with the Axon 30 during a family event, images of friends and family seemed particularly good. There is a softness to some shots, likely due to the photos being shrunk down from the 64-megapixel original, but the phone was able to handle most things I threw at it.</p><section data-eng-breakout="d271d4f23b974ac682bfd836cdcc2da6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b37a2d0-1642-11ec-bd3f-9ec869f25ab3" alt="ZTE Axon 30 sample images"></section><p>There’s a night mode — of course — but the Axon 30 takes pretty functional shots in low light without having to resort to using it. It did help further reduce noise and improve detail a little, but I’d also advise testing shots with AI mode on and off, as sometimes I found it meddled a little too heavily, especially with people as subjects.</p><p>And the macro camera isn’t worth your time. I suggest using the primary camera with zoom for generally better results in most situations. The problem with the macro camera seems to be that the phone has to be so close to the subject that it blocks a lot of light. That’s not great for detail-oriented photography.</p><p>Video camera modes are generally the same across most mid-range phones in recent years, and the Axon 30 isn’t hugely different. It can handle up to 4K at 60fps and a multi-camera mode lets you record from both the wide-angle and the primary camera at the same time, which is a nice trick we’ve occasionally seen on flagship phones. Due to sluggish autofocus, however, the recording quality isn’t great. If you’ve got a stable subject and good light, videos will generally come out nicely. At other times, you’ll struggle to record anything functional. Just because a phone can record 4K, it doesn’t mean you should.</p><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1224c490-1571-11ec-afcf-825b32632843" alt="ZTE Axon 30 review" data-uuid="6e71016f-7a16-3e39-8320-d41ca3582a07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>With the Axon 30, ZTE has proved it can successfully camouflage its under-display camera. But that doesn’t mean it’s up to the task. Image quality from the secretive selfie lens really isn’t good enough, even if the implementation is impressive. Aside from that, the Axon 30 has a gorgeous, fluid screen and a decent rear camera setup. The lack of wider 5G support in the US is frustrating in a 2021 phone, but there is still a lot here for $500. The bigger challenge is that competition is tough in the middleweight phone arena. Google’s latest Pixel, the 5a, rings in at $450, and offers better-performing cameras, front and back. If you’re struggling to pick between the two, the decision loosely boils down to a bigger screen or better selfies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b5a2e5b-32ba-4e1e-b89b-825f5a87f0fc</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:32:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632152511</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:42:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124ce600-1571-11ec-acdc-e652b6376c24" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/124cbef0-1571-11ec-ad7b-052195c49d14" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Mat Smith]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ZTE Axon 30 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With the debut of new Echo Show 8 and Show 5 devices in June, we&#39;ve seen a few good deals on Amazon&#39;s first-generation smart displays since then. A new one has popped up on both Amazon and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/qnyBqn">Best Buy</a> for the original <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3nPM3aD">Echo Show 8</a>, dropping it down to a record low of $64. That&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen all year on the gadget, and it&#39;s even better than the $70 sale price that we saw during Amazon Prime Day.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nPM3aD" id="82831fda5d7c4da8a82fe8b75b757127" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 8 (1st gen) at Amazon - $64</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/qnyBqn" id="e2d7a316af65496e98cd35ba81de432b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 8 (1st gen) at Best Buy - $64</a><p>The Echo Show 8 sits in the middle of Amazon&#39;s smart display lineup with its 8-inch HD screen. While the Echo Show 5 excels as a smart alarm clock, the Echo Show 8 lets you watch videos, view photos and check out security camera feeds with a bit more comfort. The larger display is also better for video chats and it has a physical camera shutter (along with a microphone on/off button) for when you want extra privacy. If the Show 5 is a bit too small for you but the $250 Echo Show 10 is too expensive (or you&#39;re freaked out by its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">swiveling base</a>), the Show 8 will likely hit a sweet spot with its power, screen real estate and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:updated Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3tTqdUo">updated Echo Show 8</a> is only a few months old but it&#39;s much pricer at $130 and it&#39;s not significantly different from the first-generation. It has a faster octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera with auto-framing, which means it will automatically pan to track your face and keep you in view during video calls. This feature also works with all video chat services that the device supports, including Skype and Zoom, so it will come in handy if you frequently make calls with the Show 8. But you could safely skip the 2021 model if you mostly use your smart displays for weather alerts, calendar appointments, music streaming and other basic tasks.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-first-generation-echo-show-8-is-on-sale-for-64-right-now-152439302.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f25da33-177b-41ef-be12-f9bfb9225bd5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 15:24:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632151481</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T15:24:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2F40dc0430-dfbb-11e9-ae9b-ca5928634a9b&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=f96c45df5b3abe419f169fd22a70f0ac82b3af8e" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s first-generation Echo Show 8 is on sale for $64 right now]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
