The first of those features would make it easier for those with protected accounts to make their tweets publicly viewable in instances where they want to reply to non-followers. “If you have a protected account and reply to someone who isn’t following you, you may not know they can’t see your reply,” Lena Emara, Twitter people experience designer, <a href="https://twitter.com/LenaEmara/status/1412458812863299592?s=20">wrote in a thread</a>. So one idea is to include a prompt that reminds people of that fact, as well as give them the option to easily switch their tweets to public.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/560ab770-de8d-11eb-a7df-ac7ad80954de" alt="Twitter Replies concept" data-uuid="4e74df9c-817d-3585-b5f6-b954cb0bc347"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Another potential feature would help those with multiple accounts. A mockup Emara shared shows an interface element that would allow you to switch to a different account directly from Twitter’s main composition window. What’s more, the new interface would allow you to see, at a glance, the name, handle and privacy status of your accounts all in one place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two other concepts Emara shared focus more on privacy. One of those details a feature that would periodically touch base with users to see if they’re happy with their current discoverability and conversation settings and make it easy to tweak them as needed without visiting the app’s settings menu. Lastly, the second one would create a system for notifying you when people search for your username and give you more control over whether your account is discoverable that way. That’s something that could be significant for limiting online harassment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/86318780-de8d-11eb-b77e-c1838b72203e" alt="Twitter concept 2" data-uuid="fbf64a4b-22cc-39bd-bf06-f69f75673686"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>As with the last time Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-concept-200046070.html">showed off several concept features</a>, everything you see above “are just ideas and not being built (yet?).” They may never mature into features the company ships. That said, the feedback Twitter collects could inform other tools the company builds in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-privacy-concepts-192700072.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5371f3b-68dc-4cb7-b851-a3b82d4ff48d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 19:27:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625601692</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T20:01:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e134be50-de8c-11eb-bf7f-3bdd08b3bd19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e134be50-de8c-11eb-bf7f-3bdd08b3bd19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter privacy check-in]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter privacy check-in]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown' arrives September 22nd, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-trailer-223258995.html"><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em></a><em>,</em> the long-awaited third open-world entry in the Test Drive series, at last has a release date, but fans are in for quite the wait.

The Pentagon said it “initiated contract termination procedures” in a <a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2682992/future-of-the-joint-enterprise-defense-infrastructure-cloud-contract/">press release</a> it shared on Tuesday, noting “the Department has determined that, due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs.”</p><p>With JEDI, the Defense Department had planned to modernize its IT infrastructure, but the contract hadn’t moved forward since the Pentagon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-jedi-dod-azure.html">awarded it to Microsoft in 2019</a> on account of a legal challenge from Amazon. One month after JEDI went to Redmond, Amazon filed a formal challenge with the US Court of Federal Claims, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-14-amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-protest.html">alleging the Pentagon showed “unmistakable bias”</a> when it evaluated the two companies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the lawsuit was eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-amazon-jedi-lawsuit-trump-vendetta.html">unsealed later that same year</a>, it came out that Amazon believed it lost the contract due to interference from former President Donald Trump. According to the company, Trump “used his power to ‘screw Amazon’ out of the JEDI Contract as part of his highly public personal vendetta against Mr. Bezos, Amazon and The Washington Post.”</p><p>Following an internal audit, the Pentagon&#39;s inspector general <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-trump-amazon-jedi-contract-162147083.html">released a report</a> that said it found no evidence that the Trump Administration had interfered with the procurement process. At the same time, it noted that several White House officials did not cooperate with the probe. As such, it could not definitively determine whether the administration had affected the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shortly after the Defense Department announced it wasn’t moving forward with JEDI, Microsoft published a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/06/microsofts-commitment-to-the-dod-remains-steadfast/">blog post</a> on the decision. “We understand the DOD’s rationale, and we support them and every military member who needs the mission-critical 21st century technology JEDI would have provided. The DOD faced a difficult choice: continue with what could be a years-long litigation battle or find another path forward,” the company said. “The security of the United States is more important than any single contract, and we know that Microsoft will do well when the nation does well.”</p><p>Microsoft went on to say the episode highlights the need for lawmakers to look at the challenge process. &quot;The 20 months since DOD selected Microsoft as its JEDI partner highlights issues that warrant the attention of policymakers: when one company can delay, for years, critical technology upgrades for those who defend our nation, the protest process needs reform,&quot; it said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We understand and agree with the DOD’s decision. Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement,&quot; a spokesperson for Amazon said. &quot;Our commitment to supporting our nation’s military and ensuring that our warfighters and defense partners have access to the best technology at the best price is stronger than ever. We look forward to continuing to support the DOD’s modernization efforts and building solutions that help accomplish their critical missions.”</p><p>Alongside the cancelation, the Pentagon announced a new multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability (JWCC). The agency plans to collect proposals from both Amazon and Microsoft. It contends they&#39;re the two vendors best suited to meet its needs, though it also plans to see if other companies can help it modernize its IT infrastructure. The Defense Department <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and other outlets during a call that it expects to award the first direct JWCC contracts in 2022, with the procurement process to open more broadly as soon as 2025. It also said the litigation with Amazon wasn&#39;t the primary reason for the cancelation of JEDI. “The mission needs have been our primary driver on this,” John Sherman, the DOD acting chief information officer, said.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 3:29PM ET:</strong> Added comment from Amazon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17859900-103e-4897-9ce3-6883ce0518f5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 17:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625599874</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T19:31:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/15ddb2e0-3e09-11ea-a69f-c6942218a0ce" width="5576" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeremy Christensen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aerial view of the United States Pentagon, the Department of Defense headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington DC, with I-395 freeway and the Air Force Memorial and Arlington Cemetery nearby.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's neck speakers are back and now they're for remote workers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just when you think Sony doesn’t have any more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-05-20-sony-rolly-finally-brings-the-party-stateside.html">weird and fanciful designs</a> left in it, the company surprises you. Building on devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-18-sony-immersive-wearable-speaker-hands-on-srs-ws1.html">SRS-WS1</a>, it announced the <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-electronics-introduces-the-srs-nb10-wireless-neckband-speaker-the-ultimate-work-from-home-companion-301325627.html"><ins>SRS-NB10</ins></a> on Tuesday. It&#39;s a neckband speaker the company says it designed with remote workers in mind. Set to cost $150 when it goes on sale later this year, the NB10 promises up to 20 hours of audio playback “optimized for your ears alone” with drivers that are angled upward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cc2b1440-de74-11eb-a27c-dda354014ee3" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Sony SRS-NB10" data-uuid="a190e2e5-09a4-3c88-aad3-d8189d7b72b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>As long as you’re listening to something at a relatively low volume, Sony says you “don’t need to worry about distracting colleagues, roommates or family.” But let’s be real here, you’re wearing a speaker on your shoulders.

You can also use it for voice and video calls. Thanks to two beamforming microphones and its built-in voice processing technology, Sony claims the NB10 will make it easy for people on the other end of a call to hear you. What’s more, the “open-ear” design makes it so that you can hear what’s going on around you.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26af88b0-de75-11eb-bfef-ddcbf805d216" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="SRS-NB10" data-uuid="f3b5c5c4-d888-325b-9bfa-fcb7dab9d1fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The NB10 can connect to two Bluetooth-capable devices simultaneously, allowing you to switch between them as needed. Should you have the courage to wear the NB10 to say the gym, they’re also IPX4-certified water-resistant.

It stated that Muse Group will collect users&#39; personal data and possibly share that information with third parties, including law enforcement and potential buyers. That led to claims from users that the software was becoming &quot;spyware.&quot;</p><p>The company has <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>attempted</ins></a> to clear up the controversy, which it says is primarily down to &quot;unclear phrasing in the Privacy Policy,” as <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/audacity-spyware-claims"><em><ins>Music Radar</ins></em></a> reported. Muse Group says it will only collect &quot;very limited&quot; data (operating system version, processor type, IP address and opt-in error reports) from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Audacity"><ins>Audacity</ins></a> users. Users&#39; IP addresses are stored in a readable format for 24 hours before they become &quot;pseudonymized and irretrievable.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Muse Group added it will only share data if required by a court in a jurisdiction in which it operates. It won&#39;t hand over user information following a law enforcement request or otherwise sell or share data. The data collection is &quot;a standard policy requirement for providing services in many jurisdictions, regardless of the depth of data collected or nature of service,&quot; the company said.</p><p>&quot;We do understand that unclear phrasing of the Privacy Policy and lack of context regarding introduction has led to major concerns about how we use and store the very limited data we collect,&quot; Muse Group&#39;s head of strategy Daniel Ray <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1225"><ins>wrote on GitHub</ins></a>. The company is working with its legal team on a revised, clearer version of the policy, which it plans to publish soon.</p><p>The limited data collection is necessary because of two new features in the upcoming version of Audacity, according to Ray: a way to automatically check for updates, and the optional error reporting. Ray didn&#39;t address a privacy policy request for users aged under 13 not to use the app. The General Public License under which Audacity is distributed doesn&#39;t allow restrictions on the use of software.&nbsp;</p><p>The updated privacy policy does not apply &quot;to offline use of the application,&quot; so if you block Audacity&#39;s access to the internet, it shouldn&#39;t be an issue. The policy will only come into force with the next version of the software, 3.0.3. Current and older versions don&#39;t have any networking features and they won&#39;t collect any data.</p><p>At best, this was a case of miscommunication which caused concern among Audacity users. Nevertheless, many community members are <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/1240"><ins>pushing for</ins></a> a fork of the open-source app without any data collection requirements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audacity-data-collection-privacy-policy-muse-group-145857557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">580774a6-0449-4fc2-bafe-0a5256d5ba17</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625583690</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T15:01:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c75411c0-de69-11eb-b7af-9a05c33319d0" width="926" height="557" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c75411c0-de69-11eb-b7af-9a05c33319d0" width="926" height="557" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The premium OnePlus 9 Pro is $100 off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The OnePlus 9 Pro holds its own against the stiff competition from Apple and Samsung, and that&#39;s more than most competing smartphones can say. If you&#39;re looking for a different sort of handset with all the premium features typically found in a smartphone made by the usual suspects, the OnePlus 9 Pro could fit the bill. But just like Apple&#39;s and Samsung&#39;s flagships, the 9 Pro doesn&#39;t come cheap with a starting price of $1,070. But Amazon has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:9 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3qNVYNf">9 Pro</a> for $100 less right now, bringing it down to $970 — the cheapest we&#39;ve seen it since launch. And if you want to spend even less, the regular <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:OnePlus 9" href="https://amzn.to/3jPgrjg">OnePlus 9</a> is on sale for $650, or $80 off its normal price.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy OnePlus 9 Pro at Amazon - $970" href="https://amzn.to/3qNVYNf">Buy OnePlus 9 Pro at Amazon - $970</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy OnePlus 9 at Amazon - $650" href="https://amzn.to/3jPgrjg">Buy OnePlus 9 at Amazon - $650</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> impressed us with its comprehensive set of features and (for the most part) it&#39;s excellent cameras. While slimmer than previous models, the 9 Pro doesn&#39;t look drastically different than other OnePlus smartphones and that&#39;s a good thing. It has a lovely 6.7-inch, 3,216 x 1,440 AMOLED display that supports up to a 120Hz refresh rate and a brightness up to 1,300 nits. OnePlus also includes a bunch of customizable screen settings that can help you do things like get the best mobile gaming experience or increase battery life when necessary. The IP68-rated handset also has dual speakers, a microSIM card slot and one Warp Charge-compatible USB-C port.</p><p>OnePlus collaborated with Hasselblad on the 9 Pro&#39;s rear camera array, which includes a 48-megapixel main camera, 50MP ultra-wide lens and an 8MP telephoto lens. Overall, the system produces lovely images with true-to-life colors, and it&#39;s capable of shooting video in up to 8K 30fps. Our biggest gripe was with the telephoto lens, which had a tendency to take overexposed images in bright environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, we had no complaints about the OnePlus 9 Pro&#39;s performance. It runs on a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and there&#39;s very little that combination of specs can&#39;t handle. The 9 Pro&#39;s highly responsive display only helps the smartphone feel ever fast, too. Battery life is also quite good as the dual 4,500mAh cells lasted at least a full day without breaking a sweat, and you&#39;ll get even more juice out of them if you leave the display on Full HD.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-deal-100-off-amazon-143951540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efe996b4-fb72-4435-84a3-4bb35df4b66e</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:39:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625582422</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T14:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/28f16030-de66-11eb-957b-dba7de21ab89" width="2400" height="1390" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/28f16030-de66-11eb-957b-dba7de21ab89" width="2400" height="1390" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The premium OnePlus 9 Pro is $100 off at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Batters in the Home Run Derby will livestream using 5G helmet cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to see a pro baseball player&#39;s at-bat through their eyes, you&#39;re about to get your chance. T-Mobile is marketing its 5G network by equipping players at the 2021 Home Run Derby with 5G point-of-view cameras on their helmets, including the catchers&#39; masks. Watch the live competition through a <a href="https://www.t-mobilebeyondthebases.com/#/">special T-Mobile website</a> and you can witness both batting practice and the derby itself as if you were on the field, with 5G (hopefully) keeping everything in sync.</p><p>The event kicks off July 12th, starting with practice at 6:30PM Eastern and the derby itself at 8PM. The POV cameras are also coming alongside a new MLB AR mobile app to explore Coors Field in 3D and get detailed stats for each swing. People with 5G phones will also get extra stats like hang time and exit velocity, although this is clearly just an incentive to upgrade your device. You don&#39;t need 5G to get a few extra numbers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The footage is &#39;only&#39; in HD, and it&#39;s not clear which players will have 5G cameras. T-Mobile says they&#39;ll have three or four hat cameras during batting practice, and then they&#39;ll have two during the derby (one for the American League, one for the National League) in addition to a catcher camera. If all goes well, though, you&#39;ll see what it&#39;s like for stars like Shohei Ohtani when they knock one out of the park. Look at it this way — even if the cameras are limited, this is one of the few 5G tie-ins that&#39;s more than just a gimmick.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-mlb-home-run-derby-5g-player-cameras-142640402.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6d92706-0954-41d1-93a9-8c0d0beeb6cf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 14:26:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625591399</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T17:10:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c34de5e0-de34-11eb-b6fd-3c0499abca08" width="6937" height="4624" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c34de5e0-de34-11eb-b6fd-3c0499abca08" width="6937" height="4624" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Shirey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANAHEIM, CA - JULY 05:  Shohei Ohtani #17 of the Los Angeles Angels singles during the game between the Boston Red Sox and the Los Angeles Angels at Angel Stadium on Monday, July 5, 2021 in Anaheim, California.

While it was already a tempting gadget for those looking to save energy and make their homes smarter, Google sweetened the deal by pricing the thermostat at $130. It has since gone on sale a few times, but today you can grab the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:snow color option" href="https://amzn.to/2UroLem">snow color option</a> for $88, which is 32 percent off its normal price and a record low. Also, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:snow Thermostat with a Trim Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3ytWBhG">snow Thermostat with a Trim Kit</a> is on sale for $103, or $12 less than the other Trim Kit packages. <a href="https://amzn.to/3yqfhyK">Other colors are down to $100</a>, which is the same sale price we saw back in April <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-thermostat-amazon-deal-111504158.html">around Earth Day</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nest Thermostat at Amazon - $88" href="https://amzn.to/2UroLem">Buy Nest Thermostat at Amazon - $88</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nest Thermostat + Trim Kit at Amazon - $103" href="https://amzn.to/3ytWBhG">Buy Nest Thermostat + Trim Kit at Amazon - $103</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Compared to previous Nest thermostats, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nest-thermostat-2020-redesign-google-home-130-specs-pre-order-140039186.html">this one</a> is slimmer, has a touch-sensitive edge and a mirrored display that both looks lovely and automatically wakes up when you approach it. In addition to looking better than most conventional thermostats, the Nest Thermostat is much smarter as well, allowing you to control via on-device controls, Google&#39;s Home app and even with Assistant or Alexa voice commands. The device itself has a redesigned controller view too, which makes it easier to quickly set the temperature in your home.</p><p>But the automatic features are likely the biggest selling points for a device like the Nest Thermostat. It recognizes when you&#39;ve left your home and will automatically go into Eco mode, keeping your home at a specific temperature until you return when it will either raise or lower the temperature based on your preferences. This Nest Thermostat also has Savings Finder, a feature that continuously looks for ways to reduce your energy bill throughout the year. For example, the device will suggest adjustments based on weather conditions — think reducing your home heat usage during a particularly warm winter — that you can choose to accept in order to potentially decrease your energy costs. Although a smart thermostat like Nest&#39;s takes a bit more installation that a standard smart light bulb, it&#39;s a good entry point into the smart home world — and it&#39;s even better when on sale like this.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-thermostat-sale-amazon-daily-deal-134858109.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea53682f-b743-47c6-938b-56a6d1b61dd4</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 13:48:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625579382</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T13:49:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/3b81b9a0-9921-11eb-abe7-fb12ee5f322a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/3b81b9a0-9921-11eb-abe7-fb12ee5f322a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nest Thermostat]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nest Thermostat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing's wireless earbuds will offer ANC for $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nothing is borrowing a strategy from its founder Carl Pei&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carl-pei-leaving-oneplus-235552807.html">previous gig at OnePlus</a>: dribbling technical details ahead of a product launch.

After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-new-switch-oled-rumor.html">years of rumors</a>, the company has at last confirmed the existence of a new Switch model with an OLED display. It&#39;ll cost $349.99 and arrive on October 8th.</p><p>As expected, the latest model has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-4k-022740993.html">a larger, seven-inch screen</a>. The 720p OLED display, which Nintendo claims is more vivid, is a step up from the 6.2-inch LCD screen on the original Switch. The console has significantly reduced bezels and 64GB of storage, while the dock has a wired LAN port.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nintendo is promising &quot;enhanced audio&quot; with the new Switch, which works with all existing Joy-Con controllers. The company is offering it in the traditional neon red/blue color scheme with a black dock, or in a white/black color scheme with a white dock.</p><div id="8e504f7d12674aa38c51c8cac3ea4058"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The new Switch also has what looks like a <em>massively</em> improved kickstand that spans the entire width of the back of the console. It can be propped up at any angle and looks far sturdier than the tiny, fragile piece of plastic that propped up the old Switch.</p><p>However, there&#39;s no 4K output, as reports had widely suggested. You&#39;ll still only play at a maximum resolution of 1080p in docked mode. Nor has Nintendo said it will upgrade any other parts of the Switch. The OLED device was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-upgraded-oled-switch-will-reportedly-use-an-nvidia-gpu-082107049.html">rumored</a> to use NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS tech with an upgraded chip. The company also warned that tweaks such as the larger screen mean the new Switch might not work as neatly with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-02-nintendo-labo-vr-review-cardboard.html">Nintendo Labo products</a>.</p><p>The original Switch is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-is-selling-way-more-switches-than-it-predicted-083640962.html">selling like hot cakes</a>, so there’s a case to be made that Nintendo didn&#39;t need to upgrade the console just yet. But the original Switch&#39;s display and huge bezels are starting to look a little bit dated in 2021; this OLED screen should modernize the experience significantly. That said, for people who want to save some cash, Nintendo will continue selling the original Switch, at least for now.</p><p>It&#39;s highly likely that demand will far exceed supply. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-second-console-144551868.html">told investors</a> in a call in May that the company was still contending with shortages and production issues. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">current global scarcity of semiconductors</a> will also limit production capacity. So, the new Switch might be even harder to find than the current console has been at various points.</p><p>Since it released the original Switch in 2017, Nintendo has issued a revised model <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-nintendo-switch-upgraded-battery-life.html">with a battery upgrade</a>. It also released the handheld-only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-nintendo-switch-lite-review.html">Switch Lite</a> in 2019. Two years later, moving in the other direction with an upgraded Switch is a logical move. Good luck getting your hands on one any time soon, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ffbc4a7f-5053-4eb5-8793-b0d878c92067</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 13:13:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625580366</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T14:06:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b081aa10-de5b-11eb-a7af-98922c0c41ac" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b081aa10-de5b-11eb-a7af-98922c0c41ac" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch with OLED screen]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch with OLED screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Animal Crossing, Mario and Pokémon Switch games drop to all-time lows]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you have somehow not jumped on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Animal Crossing" href="https://amzn.to/3xmK5jF"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a> bandwagon yet, now&#39;s your chance to do so for less.

Despite decrying the competitive nature of the free-to-play gaming market, the company isn&#39;t giving up on those titles it deems successful.

The notorious con-man pretended to be Russian oligarch Simon Leviev, the son of Russian-Israeli diamond mogul Lev Leviev. He would take his victims — mostly Scandinavian women — on trips via private jets, stay with them in luxury hotels and treat them to expensive dinners. In truth, he&#39;s an Israeli man named Shimon Hayut, who fled to Europe twice to escape theft, forgery and fraud charges in his home country.&nbsp;</p><p>Online dating scams have been fairly common these past years, with con-artists using every available outlet into finding potential victims.

And that&#39;s just for the scams Americans reported to the agency. The Tinder Swindler hit the headlines for living a jet set lifestyle, though, with previous victims funding his efforts into wooing his current ones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hayut would spend months pretending to be in a relationship with his targets before he begins asking them for money, usually pretending to be in trouble to ask his current &quot;girlfriend&quot; for help. Norwegian publication <a href="https://www.vg.no/spesial/2019/tindersvindleren/english/"><em>VG</em></a> spent six months tracking Hayut and got in contact with two of his most recent victims. One of the women it interviewed said she had to take out loans to help him out and ended up being scammed out of 2.1 Norwegian Krones (US$244,000).&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix&#39;s documentary will be produced by the makers of <em>Three Identical Strangers</em> and <em>Don&#39;t F*** With Cats</em>, both of which are also available on the streaming platform.

The highlight feature of the company&#39;s new Seoul earbuds is a mode toggle that Urbanista claims reduces Bluetooth latency to about 70ms. A dedicated latency toggle isn’t something we’ve seen on a lot of true wireless headphones. Most gaming-oriented earbuds use Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html">aptX Bluetooth codec</a> to get latency as low as possible.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43c4a0a0-ddb9-11eb-b736-0c4bdb031a57" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Seoul" data-uuid="9b3ff420-36d0-3eca-9065-df36a8d90925"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>With the codec’s low-latency variant, Qualcomm claims you get that number down to about 40ms. The downside of aptX is both your earbuds and phone need to support the codec. That’s not a problem with most Snapdragon devices since Qualcomm makes those too, but you won’t find the codec supported on Apple devices. That’s what makes the Seoul earbuds interesting. They give you a device agnostic way to get a low-latency mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that feature, the Seoul earbuds are about what you expect from a pair of mid-range true wireless earbuds in 2021. At $89.90, they feature a claimed eight hours of battery life on a single charge, with the included case allowing you to get another 32 hours of playtime before the entire unit needs to recharge. At that point, you can charge them using either a USB-C cable or Qi charging pad.  They’re also IPX4-certified, come with Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and feature both Google Assistant and Siri integration. Urbanista will sell the Seoul earbuds in four colors: black, blue, purple and white.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/09f791c0-ddb9-11eb-9fff-0accef854609" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Lisbon" data-uuid="9f482045-319c-3af0-aae6-e16cd856821d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>For those looking for something more affordable, Urbanista also announced its new Lisbon earbuds. At $49.90, they’re the company’s cheapest true wireless earbuds to date. Looking at the spec sheet Urbanista sent over, they look decent too. Battery life comes in at a claimed nine hours on a single charge. With the included charging case, you can get a total of 27 hours of playtime from them. They don’t feature waterproofing, but you do get Bluetooth 5.2 support and USB-C charging, as well as Google Assistant and Siri integration. They’ll come in five colors: pastel red, beige, pink, green and black.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/urbanista-seoul-gaming-true-wireless-earbuds-announcement-080005653.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b610cde-d2a7-4a14-9f8b-2e6b2fc52900</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 06 Jul 2021 08:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625508380</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T18:06:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c810b070-ddb8-11eb-bbce-f6abe0192847" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c810b070-ddb8-11eb-bbce-f6abe0192847" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Urbanista]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Urbanista Seoul]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Urbanista Seoul]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bumble is opening a restaurant to help people date IRL again]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With more and more people getting fully vaccinated against <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19">COVID-19</a>, many single folks are ditching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-bumble-online-experiences-virtual-dates-130012757.html">virtual dates</a> for in-person ones.

The open-source software is now collecting user data for &quot;app analytics&quot; and &quot;improving our app&quot; as well as &quot;for legal enforcement.&quot;</p><p>The privacy policy was updated on July 2nd, following Muse Group&#39;s <a href="https://mu.se/newsroom/tpost/6dhedma301-muse-group-acquires-audacity-expanding-c">acquisition</a> of Audacity in April — Muse Group also owns Ultimate Guitar and notation app MuseScore. As reported by <a href="https://fosspost.org/audacity-is-now-a-spyware/"><em>Foss Post</em></a>, the policy notes Muse Group is collecting details about users&#39; operating system version, processor, country based on IP address, crash reports and non-fatal error codes and messages. According to the policy, processing that data is in the &quot;legitimate interest&quot; of the company &quot;to offer and ensure the proper functioning of the app.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The data it collects on law enforcement grounds is more vague. The policy says Muse Group will capture &quot;data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities&#39; requests (if any).&quot; It may share personal data with &quot;any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary.&quot; Data may be shared with potential buyers too.</p><p>Users&#39; personal data is stored on servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, Muse Group is &quot;occasionally required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our external counsel in the USA.&quot; Muse Group noted that whenever personal data is &quot;transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in accordance with [the European Union&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a>].&quot;</p><p>The policy states users&#39; IP addresses are &quot;stored in an identifiable way&quot; for a day before they&#39;re hashed. That leaves users open to identification through law enforcement or government data requests.</p><p>Several other points in the privacy policy have raised some eyebrows, including asking under-13s not to use Audacity. That, as <em>Foss Post</em> notes, may violate the license under which Audacity is distributed. The General Public License prohibits restrictions on software use. Engadget has contacted Muse Group for comment.</p><p>All is not lost for Audacity users who value their privacy and pre-teens who tinker with audio in the app. Some users have been <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213">calling for</a> a fork of the software, a new version of the app based on the source code. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the community take Audacity in that direction.</p><p>Until that fork arrives, privacy-conscious users might want to find alternative software, or at least block Audacity from accessing the internet. After all, it&#39;s a desktop app that doesn&#39;t have any tangible online functions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audacity-privacy-policy-spyware-accusations-data-collection-210001803.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06062508-3fd8-452a-96b6-f2b247d41c60</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 21:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625582569</ingested><modified>2021-07-06T14:43:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook, Google and Twitter threaten to leave Hong Kong over privacy law changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tech companies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-hong-kong-stops-data-requests-134700801.html">at odds with the Hong Kong government</a>, and that tension appears to be on the rise. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036?mod=djemalertNEWS">learned</a> that the Asia Internet Coalition, a tech alliance including Facebook, Google and Twitter, has quietly warned Hong Kong that companies would stop operating in the territory if officials move forward with data protection law amendments that could hold companies liable for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-former-senate-it-worker-pleads-guilty-to-doxxing-senators-on-wik.html">doxxing</a> campaigns.</p><p>The tech giants are worried that staff could face criminal investigations or even charges if users share personal info online, even if they didn&#39;t mean any harm.  That would be a &quot;completely disproportionate and unnecessary response&quot; and could chill free speech, the Coalition wrote. The alliance instead suggested that Hong Kong narrow the scope of violations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hong Kong&#39;s Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data acknowledged the letter&#39;s existence, but said that new measures were needed after doxxing pushed the &quot;limits of morality and the law.&quot; The Commissioner also insisted that the changed laws would &quot;not have any bearing&quot; on freedom of speech, and wouldn&#39;t deter outside investment in the Hong Kong region.</p><p>The amendments could be approved by the end of the legislative year.</p><p>The concern, as you might guess, is that pro-China officials might abuse the updated laws to silence dissent. Pro-democracy activists doxxed police officers and others frequently during the 2019 protests, and there&#39;s a worry that the revised laws could be worded loosely enough that merely sharing a photo of someone in a public space could get both sharers and tech companies in trouble. It could be harder to hold police accountable for violence, or to criticize officials for anti-democratic policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-twitter-may-leave-hong-kong-190015028.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efc886ff-321b-481f-8aa4-c0d3980ac903</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 19:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625492497</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T13:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/67636b50-dd90-11eb-bfdf-515275072f24" width="8000" height="5000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[d3sign via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young Asian woman with surgical face mask   to prevent the spread of viruses during the Covid-19 health crisis and using smartphone against the iconic city skyline of Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
