EA is also promising a look at a new scouting feature that it hopes to release in September. When it comes to the July 20th panel, meanwhile, EA is being tight-lipped. “Look, we’re not allowed to tell you much about this one yet, sorry,” the company said. “But we can say this Spotlight will highlight an extremely cool new addition to an extremely popular and long-running EA Sports franchise.”</p><p>Part of the reason EA plans to host these panels is so that it can make games the “unwavering” focus of its July 22nd event. From start to finish, the publisher says its main showcase should clock in at about 40 minutes.

The company showed off <a href="https://twitter.com/a_dsgnr/status/1410690421106241539">two concepts</a> for new features that would allow users to target tweets toward specific audiences without having to switch accounts or change privacy settings.</p><p>The first would enable people to designate “trusted friends” so some tweets would only be visible to that group. The idea is similar to Instagram’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-instagrams-close-friends-feature-lets-you-keep-stories-privat.html">“close friends”</a> feature for Stories. According to an image shared by Twitter designer Andrew Courter, Twitter’s version would allow users to toggle the audience much like the way you can choose who is able <a href="http://v/">to reply</a> to you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He added that “perhaps you could also see trusted friends&#39; Tweets first” in your timeline, which would offer another alternative to the chronological or algorithmic “home” timelines Twitter currently offers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9128eba0-daa1-11eb-b77f-a7894d893578" data-uuid="539aa1ff-099b-3040-82ca-38408b76fb4c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Another feature would allow people to take on different personas or “facets” from the same account. For example, a user could have a professional identity, where they tweet about work-related topics, and a personal one that’s meant more for friends and family. According to the images, users could have the option of making any one persona public or private, and new followers would be able to choose which “facet” they want to see tweets from.</p><p>Finally, Courter showed off a <a href="https://twitter.com/a_dsgnr/status/1410690515180290052">new concept</a> for filtering replies that would allow users to choose specific words or phrases “they prefer not to see.” Then, if a user who is replying or mentioning the user tries to use one of those words or phrases, Twitter will let them know the words go against that person’s preference.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b9e0f650-daa1-11eb-bfbf-38ce167aa9dc" alt="Twitter is thinking about new ways to set " data-uuid="317afaba-3ca6-3b42-b5e2-c96bc0f9c7ba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>According to the images shared by Courter, the feature wouldn’t prevent anyone from sending a tweet using the offending words, but it would make it less visible to the person on the receiving end. The idea is similar to other kinds of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-anti-bullying-prompts-expansion-173049219.html">anti-bullying nudges</a> Twitter has employed in the past, but would go a step further as each user could set their own conversational “boundaries.”</p><p>All these features are still just ideas — Courter noted that “we’re not building these yet” — so they may never actually launch. But the company is looking for feedback on the designs, so they could inform future tools Twitter does decide to build. At the very least, it sheds some light on how Twitter is thinking about issues like identity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-trusted-friends-facets-concept-200046070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b63d4f33-cf26-4bf2-b532-66a0557e0d6e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 20:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625170242</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T20:10:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/72778f40-daa1-11eb-bffd-9b957d0e9dbb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/72778f40-daa1-11eb-bffd-9b957d0e9dbb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is considering a "trusted friends" feature.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[twitter trusted friends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EA is reportedly developing a 'Dead Space' remake]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EA is reportedly working on a remake of <em>Dead Space</em>.

The <a href="https://support.insomniac.games/hc/en-us/articles/4403977358861-Version-1-002-Release-Notes"><ins>latest patch</ins></a> bumps up the framerate from 30 fps to 40 fps in that mode.</p><p>The update slightly makes up for the lack of variable refresh rate (VRR) support on PS5 as things stand, though Sony plans to enable that through an update in the future. The fidelity mode prioritizes visuals over performance, offering ray tracing and up to 4K resolution, but the framerate was capped at 30 fps. The performance and performance RT modes have lower resolution, but run the game at 60 fps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aiming for 40 fps might seem like an odd number when we&#39;re so used to having 60Hz and 120 Hz displays. Because 40 divides neatly into 120, a 120Hz screen will show a new frame on every three refreshes. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558816/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-fidelity-mode-40fps-120hz-30fps-refresh-rate"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> notes, that will help ensure <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</em> looks smooth if you have a compatible display. It&#39;ll certainly seem slicker than a framerate that doesn&#39;t match up with how often a screen refreshes, which could cause screen tearing.</p><p>The framerate issue should become less complicated for PS5 developers once the VRR update arrives. Xbox Series X/S and many PC GPUs currently have VRR support, and more 120Hz+ monitors and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tvs-for-gaming-180033983.html">TVs are hitting the market</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Insomniac rolled out an update for its other PS5 blockbuster, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/miles-morales-ps5-review-spider-man-161228925.html"><em><ins>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</ins></em></a>.

Instead of adhering to the usual 60-second limit, they could share clips that were as long as three minutes. Starting today and “over the coming weeks,” TikTok says it will <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/longer-videos">roll out that capability to everyone</a>. You’ll get a notification from the app once you can use the feature.</p><p>TikTok says it’s making the change to give people more flexibility when it comes to crafting their videos, especially when it comes to content like cooking and beauty tutorials that are tough to pull off over a series of short clips. “With longer videos, creators will have the canvas to create new or expanded types of content on TikTok, with the flexibility of a bit more space,” the company says of the change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now that the feature is becoming more widely available, it will be interesting to see how the TikTok community responds to it. When some of the first longer videos hit the platform, the response was one of collective bewilderment. After all, the 60-second format is so central to TikTok’s identity. That’s not to say longer videos will erode the app&#39;s popularity, but you always worry when a platform moves away, even if it’s just a small step, from what made it popular in the first place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-three-minute-videos-now-available-182016623.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94898332-10c9-43c3-8df6-c656c88d711e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 18:20:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625162542</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T18:02:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/b804bcd0-43b2-11eb-b7ff-09e10b41b8fc" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/b804bcd0-43b2-11eb-b7ff-09e10b41b8fc" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[macOS Monterey preview: All about FaceTime and Safari]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With all of the changes that came to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-big-sur-review-180036335.html">macOS Big Sur</a> last year, we didn&#39;t expect Apple to deliver much with this year&#39;s update, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-monterey-182454905.html">Monterey</a>. And for the most part, that prediction held true. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">iOS 15 </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-get-ios-15-beta-available-today-172240291.html?src=rss">iPadOS 15 </a>got the bulk of the upgrades this time around. But that doesn&#39;t mean Apple has forgotten about its computers. After testing out the first macOS Monterey public beta, I&#39;d wager Mac fans will be pleased to see just how much it pushes Apple&#39;s desktop vision forward. It&#39;s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">a dramatic leap like Windows 11</a>, but it doesn&#39;t really have to be.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="baf9fb79-43d4-4a44-8d46-f5bcee80f03b"/><h2>What&#39;s in the public beta?</h2><p>This Monterey public beta includes the FaceTime and SharePlay updates, which will also show up in Apple&#39;s mobile operating systems. There&#39;s also the dramatically redesigned Safari browser, and improved Focus options for managing notifications and other distractions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unfortunately, you won&#39;t see what&#39;s perhaps the most anticipated new feature: Universal Control. That lets you use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple Macs and iPads simultaneously. Given just how complex the feature appears to be, it makes sense for Apple to take time and make sure it&#39;s fully baked. It&#39;ll likely pop up in a future beta as we get closer to a final release in the fall.</p><section data-eng-breakout="bcbeb1b8cac84451b0ef7d4384e90208" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3861e702-da93-11eb-9f7d-c191af84e3bc" alt="macOS Monterey"></section><h2>Safari</h2><p>After loading up the Monterey public beta for the first time, I had a hard time telling if I had actually upgraded from Big Sur. But then I launched the new Safari browser, which sent my head spinning. Say goodbye to the tabs bar — and get used to juggling your tabs, address bar and navigation buttons all in a thin menu at the top.</p><p>Clearly, the goal is to devote as much screen space as possible to web pages. That makes for a better browsing experience on smaller devices, like the 13-inch MacBook Air I’ve been using to test the software. But it also means a lot more clutter when trying to sort through your tabs. It&#39;s not bad when dealing with just a few tabs, but once I racked up 10 or more, they all got reduced to their site icons. It used to take a lot more tabs to make Safari that unusable.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e042bd50-da93-11eb-b5f5-a671141fd01a" alt="macOS Monterey" data-uuid="065fbaa1-b93a-34e1-a88b-4a33ca290d51"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Although you can always hover your cursor over the icons to see a small preview of the page, that can be a slow process if you&#39;re trying to fish through tons of tabs from one site. You can also bundle tabs together in groups now, which could be useful if you&#39;re on a serious research binge. You can name tab groups and swap between different sets in an instant. It&#39;s a more elegant solution than opening more Safari windows and best of all, it&#39;s also synced across the browser on iOS and iPadOS.</p><p>Beyond the new interface, Safari is still the zippiest browser on macOS by far. I typically juggle Chrome and Safari at the same time — it&#39;s helpful for keeping work and personal logins separate — and Apple&#39;s browser always loads pages just a bit faster.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/163fd870-da94-11eb-9fdf-182584dd7911" alt="macOS Monterey Facetime Shareplay" data-uuid="791bda7b-5cb8-379e-a721-0396b520f4bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2>FaceTime and SharePlay</h2><p>In macOS Monterey, FaceTime is starting to look a lot more like Zoom. And I suppose that makes sense, given just how essential group video chats have become over the past year. Now you can start a FaceTime call without ringing anyone directly. Once you&#39;re in, you can either invite your friends <em>or</em> create a link for anyone to join, even if they&#39;re on an Android device. Your calls are more like events anticipating a group of people, instead of individual chats where you may rope in a friend or two.</p><p>During my testing, a friend was able to join my FaceTime weblink via his iPhone running iOS 14, but he couldn&#39;t hear anything. When he moved over to his Mac, everything worked fine. Since he was running macOS Catalina, though, it still showed up as a web FaceTime call, instead of automatically opening the app.</p><p>If you have AirPods or other headphones that support Spatial Audio, you&#39;ll also be able to hear people’s voices coming from different directions based on their screen position in FaceTime. They&#39;ll need to be running the Monterey or iOS/iPadOS 15 beta for the feature to work, but it&#39;ll certainly be more useful once those updates finally drop. During my testing, I heard two friends coming from the left and right channels of my AirPod Pros. It&#39;s like you&#39;re sitting at a small table together. I&#39;d imagine it would also be useful for users who are visually impaired and hard of hearing, as the separation makes it easier to keep track of multiple people.</p><p>I’d imagine many more people will be FaceTiming their friends to take advantage of SharePlay, which allows you to watch shows and listen to music with others. Using it could be more intuitive, though. When trying out the feature with other Monterey and iOS 15 beta testers, it took us a while to figure out there wasn’t a SharePlay button anywhere within FaceTime. Instead, you have to start playing a piece of media, which triggers a pop-up notification that asks if you want to share it with friends, or view it on your own.</p><p>Once I figured that out, it was nice to be able to sit back and watch a few minutes of <em>Mythic Quest</em> with my friends. Unfortunately, even though FaceTime is opening up to Android and Windows users with web video chats, those folks won’t be able to enjoy SharePlay content. And it remains to be seen if and how media providers adopt the service. With Apple TV+ content, you <em>and</em> your friends need to have subscriptions to watch anything. I can’t imagine Netflix or Disney+ being more lax and allowing a single subscriber to share something with friends.</p><h2>Other notable additions:</h2><ul><li><p>The new Focus Modes are a nice way to reduce distractions from notifications. You can also customize your Focus options to allow messages from specific users.</p></li><li><p>Quick Notes is a simple way to grab quotes and other snippets of information from websites and documents. They appear inside of the Notes app and are synchronized across all of your Apple devices with iCloud.</p></li><li><p>I didn’t have much time to dive into Shortcuts, but at first glance they appear to be a more user-friendly stab at macOS Automations. One of the built-in Shortcuts is supposed to make a GIF from video files, but it kept throwing an error whenever I tried to trigger it with Siri.</p></li><li><p>Live Text is a nifty feature that lets you select text embedded in photos. It’s useful for grabbing information from receipts, and I’d wager it’d be helpful for handwritten notes as well. But in many ways, it&#39;s really just Apple&#39;s spin on Google Lens.</p></li><li><p>I appreciated being able to use my MacBook Air as an AirPlay device. That&#39;d be particularly useful with the new iMacs, or any systems connected to great speakers.</p></li></ul>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10a3b1b4-ce90-4400-9832-33411bbab808</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 17:59:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625167400</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T19:23:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d437b60-da9f-11eb-b6d2-c27c02f86e65" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d437b60-da9f-11eb-b6d2-c27c02f86e65" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[macOS Monterey]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[macOS Monterey]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's macOS Monterey public beta is now available]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html">iOS 15</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-os-15-wwdc-2021-multitasking-widgets-update-175058732.html">iPadOS 15</a> are Apple&#39;s major software focus this year, there&#39;s still plenty to look forward to in macOS Monterey.

There are also fresh abilities, mini games, enemies, armor and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pet-the-dog-charm-new-game-plus-095551552.html">animals to pet</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="586e0e914c844b0981af896b1f51fc39"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5gVt028Hww?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Iki seems like a significant expansion that might help keep fans busy until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-170424580.html">the movie arrives</a>. New players can unlock Iki once they reach the Toyotama region in Act 2 of <em>Ghost of Tsushima.</em></p><p>The PS5 version will have a few exclusive features. Cutscenes will now support lip sync for Japanese voiceovers. The developers were able to add this feature by harnessing the PS5&#39;s real-time rendering ability for cinematics. There will be haptic feedback and adaptive trigger support for the DualSense controller, along with 3D audio, faster load times, resolution up to 4K and a target framerate of 60 fps.</p><p>Meanwhile, a patch with some useful features is on the way for all players. A target lock-on option, photo mode updates, more controller remapping and a way to hide the quiver during combat are coming soon. Additional updates are in the pipeline for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-legends-co-op-mode-release-date-150023370.html"><em>Ghost of Tsushima: Legends</em> co-op experience</a> as well, including a new mode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/82ff6940-da8e-11eb-b3fa-f6bf6104c0a9" style="height:671;width:1445;" alt="Ghost of Tsushima on PS5" data-uuid="5e90e790-8677-3ce0-9c2b-9ca5c8cae3dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sucker Punch Productions</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, you won&#39;t get a free upgrade to the Director&#39;s Cut on either console. Current <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> owners can upgrade to the PS4 Director&#39;s Cut for $20. You can then upgrade again to the PS5 version for another $10. Alternatively, you can pay $30 to upgrade straight from the original game to the PS5 Director&#39;s Cut. Phew.</p><p>Newcomers can buy <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director&#39;s Cut</em> for $60 on PS4 and $70 on PS5. While there will be physical editions available, it&#39;s maybe best to pre-order from the PlayStation Store if you&#39;re planning to play any time soon. The current game costs $60, but if you pre-order the upcoming edition at the same price, you can download and play the original PS4 game right away. You&#39;ll be able to transfer progress to <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</em> after it arrives in August.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1700563e-71a8-497d-bae2-67ecd98cdd4a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 17:11:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625159936</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T17:19:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/09a06590-da8e-11eb-bdf4-e66538abbf0a" width="1353" height="680" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/09a06590-da8e-11eb-bdf4-e66538abbf0a" width="1353" height="680" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sucker Punch Productions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima on PS5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ghost of Tsushima on PS5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony buys a studio known for porting games to PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has just bought another studio, and no it’s not Bluepoint Games.

Today, the company is making free game streaming available to 98 percent of the mainland US and bringing on board a major partner in Ubisoft. Facebook says it has now scaled-up its cloud computing infrastructure to the extent that it can roll out the service to 100 percent of the US by the fall. An international rollout is also underway, beginning in Canada and Mexico and expanding to Western and Central Europe by early 2022.</p><p>While its rivals Google and Amazon have opted for standalone cloud gaming for a monthly subscription, Facebook has built its offering into its main social network and accompanying Android app. Unlike the competition, which deliver console and PC games over the internet, the social network is focusing on smaller free-to-play mobile titles that it says are easier to host at its data centers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cloud-gaming-launch-web-android-asphalt-9-legends-120007686.html">launching</a> cloud gaming on Android in a handful of US states last October, Facebook says it has added 25 titles to the service, including newcomers <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon Touch </em>by Atari, <em>Lego Legacy Heroes Unboxed</em> and <em>Dragon Mania Legends </em>by Gameloft and <em>State of Survival</em> by FunPlus. It&#39;s also redesigned its Play section with new categories, including a list of the top games in the US, improved filtering and sorting options.</p><p>More than 1.5 million people play cloud-streamed games on Facebook every month, the company revealed. With 195 million daily users in North America and more than 1.87 billion global users on Facebook proper, the service has a big runway ahead of it. Despite offering less games than the competition, Facebook will be hoping that its focus on mobile titles can help it to thrive in the lucrative game streaming arena. The cloud gaming market will be worth an estimated $1.4 billion this year and over $5 billion in 2023, according to research firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/cloud-gaming-market-first-billion-dollar-year-23-7-million-paying-users-will-generate-revenues-of-1-4-billion-in-2021/">NewZoo</a>.</p><p>To bolster its appeal, Facebook is partnering with<strong>&nbsp;</strong>France-based developer Ubisoft. The studio&#39;s game subscription service is already available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-plus-google-stadia-150043117.html">Google Stadia</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-game-streaming-amazon-luna-google-stadia-160227004.html">Amazon Luna</a>, but (for now at least) Facebook will only host its mobile gaming titles. Ubisoft games available on the service include <em>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</em>, <em>Hungry Shark Evolution</em> and <em>Hungry Dragon, </em>with <em>Mighty Quest </em>and <em>Trials Frontier </em>launching in the coming months. Facebook also recently acquired <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-acquires-crayta-developer-unit-2-games-180131931.html">Unit 2</a>, the developer behind game creation platform <em>Crayta</em>, with plans to integrate its tools into its cloud gaming platform.</p><p>On the infrastructure side, Facebook is focusing on lowering latency caps to allow it to distribute more game genres across multiple devices. Currently, it says its &quot;sweet spot&quot; is in mobile sports, card, simulation, strategy, action-adventure, and puzzle titles, but it plans to add more variety to the mix in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook says it is still working to get cloud gaming onto iOS devices. Though its gaming app is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-slams-apples-restrictive-policies-as-its-gaming-app-arrives-on-i-os-132148396.html">available</a> on iPhones and iPads, it doesn&#39;t include playable games due to Apple&#39;s restrictions on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#third-party-software">third-party software</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cloud-gaming-ubisoft-160048634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd58facb-45fb-429f-90a3-4d5f0225d5a4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625157210</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T16:33:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a1d1fd0-da51-11eb-98f7-d2154a049e2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a1d1fd0-da51-11eb-98f7-d2154a049e2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google TV’s Watch with Me highlights celebrity movie and TV recommendations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much like bookshelves, watchlists say a lot about who we are as people. They reflect our interests and the things that inspire us. Tapping into that, Google is introducing a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-launch-android-tv-os-180529431.html">TV</a> feature called <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.blog.google_products_google-2Dtv_watchwithme-2Dlavernecox&amp;d=DwQGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=iUeMNOIuPBRnHjfl_fszGq526fhBaDKweMfHkI-i9iM&amp;m=R9FarmOJLOuWwV08eGytlo_Yiks2hiJcvdVUUxKJ6mo&amp;s=94cD8c6pluiDGn3RIxDZChRxHfhfmyU3cdQQRmJoXTc&amp;e=">Watch With Me</a>. Part of an ongoing series, it will share content recommendations from celebrities and artists. Each spotlight will also include an interview where the featured individual will talk about their picks. The first Watch With Me will star Emmy-nominated actress and LGBTQ+ advocate Laverne Cox.</p><p>Google isn’t the first company to put together a feature like this. If you’ve used HBO Max recently, you’ve likely seen the playlists the streaming service has shared around events like Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month. In that instance, HBO Max highlighted recommendations from <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> director Jon M. Chu. But in Google TV’s case, what separates Watch With Me is that you’ll get recommendations for a variety of sources, not just one streaming service, and that&#39;s likely to make you more inclined to use Google TV as a hub.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-watch-with-me-160025964.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8b919b7-dc99-4d13-b1d1-af56fe92b6c4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 16:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625091131</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T22:12:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/836b1910-d9ee-11eb-bf7e-cbbd866df43a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/836b1910-d9ee-11eb-bf7e-cbbd866df43a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Watch With Me]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Watch With Me]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Prime Gaming members can claim a trio of Lucasfilm Games classics this summer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By now, gamers are accustomed to receiving freebies through Sony&#39;s PlayStation Plus and Microsoft&#39;s Xbox Games with Gold perks.

Glenn was one of the Mercury Seven, the astronauts who were selected for the United States&#39; first spaceflight program.</p><p>Thirteen women went through the same tests as the Mercury Seven as part of the privately funded Women in Space Program. Although all of the Mercury Seven traveled to space, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/the-true-story-of-the-mercury-13-and-the-women-who-never-made-it-to-space/">none of Mercury 13 have</a> until now.

She has logged more than 19,600 flying hours and has taught more than 3,000 people to fly. Funk applied three times to join NASA&#39;s astronaut program after the agency opened it to women in the late 1970s to no avail. Six decades after Funk&#39;s first attempts to venture to space, she&#39;ll finally get her chance.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ae77586-4da8-421c-aa94-d0d61fdf4428</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 15:50:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625155101</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T15:58:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a1c1fa20-da82-11eb-baf4-59cf5c827324" width="4190" height="2590" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a1c1fa20-da82-11eb-baf4-59cf5c827324" width="4190" height="2590" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Provided by Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wally Funk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wally Funk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram is 'no longer a photo-sharing app,' says its head]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram doesn&#39;t see itself as a platform where people go to share photos anymore. That&#39;s the main takeaway from a series of recent comments made by the head of the company, Adam Mosseri. &quot;We&#39;re no longer a photo-sharing app or a square photo-sharing app,&quot; Mosseri said in a video he posted to his social media accounts this week. According to Mosseri, the main reason for that is that people come to Instagram &quot;to be entertained,&quot; and it&#39;s not the only app that offers that in what is a crowded marketplace.</p><div id="c8dfa9a4168e4cfc893cbd9474ebf807"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Changes are coming to video on Instagram 📺<br><br>At Instagram we’re always trying to build new features that help you get the most out of your experience. Right now we’re focused on four key areas: Creators, Video, Shopping and Messaging. <a href="https://t.co/ezFp4hfDpf">pic.twitter.com/ezFp4hfDpf</a></p>— Adam Mosseri 😷 (@mosseri) <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1410297743285829632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;Let&#39;s be honest, there&#39;s some really serious competition right now,&quot; Mosseri said. &quot;TikTok is huge, YouTube is even bigger and there are a lot of other upstarts as well.&quot; To stay competitive, Mosseri said Instagram has to embrace that aspect of itself, &quot;and that means change.&quot; One way the app will change is with Instagram handing out more recommendations. Mosseri referenced a test the company kicked off last week that&#39;s seen it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-suggested-posts-feed-191126529.html">intersperse &quot;Suggested Posts&quot;</a> in users&#39; feeds. He also said Instagram plans to embrace video more broadly, focusing on full-screen and immersive content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In short, what Mosseri is describing is Instagram becoming more like TikTok. And that&#39;s something we&#39;ve already seen the company try to do with features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html">Reels</a>. Of course, it&#39;s one thing to adapt to your rivals and another to lose sight of what made your platform compelling to people in the first place. Together with things like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-shop-facebook-pay-checkout-launch-130050050.html">dedicated shopping hub</a>, Reels and Stories have made Instagram feel bloated and less vital than it was before.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed2b9ba6-199f-47ca-8cc4-92d3f15e91f7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 15:31:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625153598</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T15:33:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6066be60-da7f-11eb-b7f5-716cb4c33f5e" width="4000" height="2199" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6066be60-da7f-11eb-b7f5-716cb4c33f5e" width="4000" height="2199" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DENIS CHARLET via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture taken on October 1, 2019 in Lille shows the logo of mobile app Instagram displayed on a tablet.

The four tech giants <a href="https://webfoundation.org/2021/07/generation-equality-commitments/">made the promises</a> during the UN Generation Equality Forum in Paris.</p><p>The pledge follows <a href="https://ogbv.webfoundation.org/"><ins>four consultations</ins></a> arranged by the Web Foundation that took place over 11 months. The organization then ran a few policy design workshops in April to &quot;develop prototypes that center the experiences of women most impacted by online abuse.&quot; Two core themes emerged: Curation, with a broad recommendation to &quot;build better ways for women to curate their safety online,&quot; and Reporting, with a call to &quot;implement improvements to reporting systems.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech companies promised to offer users more granular settings over who can see, comment on, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-reply-limits-to-all-users-173007909.html"><ins>reply to</ins></a> or share posts. Easier navigation and access to safety features, simpler and more accessible language across the user interface and &quot;proactively reducing the amount of abuse&quot; that women encounter are also among the commitments.</p><p>As for reporting, Facebook, Google, TikTok and Twitter say they&#39;ll enable users to have the option of tracking and managing the reports they file as well, as having more ways for women to access support and help as they go through the reporting process. The other commitments include &quot;enabling greater capacity to address context and/or language&quot; and &quot;providing more policy and product guidance when reporting abuse.&quot;</p><p>According to the Web Foundation, the companies pledged to implement their solutions within a certain time frame. They&#39;ll provide insights and data on how they&#39;re carrying out those commitments. The Web Foundation will publish annual reports on their progress as well.</p><p>More than 200 prominent figures have signed <a href="https://webfoundation.org/2021/07/generation-equality-letter/"><ins>an open letter</ins></a> to the CEOs of the four companies, urging them to take action based on the promises. Among those who have <a href="https://webfoundation.org/docs/2021/07/Generation-Equality-Open-Letter-to-tech-CEOs.pdf"><ins>signed the letter</ins></a> are actors Emma Watson and Gillian Anderson, UK Members of Parliament Diane Abbott and Jess Phillips, Creative Commons CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/C_Stihler/status/1410583248422555648"><ins>Catherine Stihler</ins></a> and ex-Australia prime minister Julia Gillard.</p><p>The Web Foundation <a href="https://onlineviolencewomen.eiu.com/"><ins>says</ins></a> 38 percent of those who identify as women have experienced online abuse. The figure rises to 45 percent for Gen Z and Millennial women. Women of color, and those in LGBTQIA+ and other marginalized communities often experience much worse abuse.</p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/partnering-with-experts-to-promote-womens-safety/"><ins>just opened</ins></a> a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/safety/womenssafety">Women&#39;s Safety Hub</a> that explains the platform&#39;s tools for bolstering privacy and security. It will also run training sessions to help people harness those tools. In addition, the hub has resources for victims of abuse.

It’s got many out there looking to upgrade from a cheap Crosley turntable and build out their first HiFi system. Of course, there are multiple pieces that go into building a decent stereo, but perhaps the most important is the speakers. If your speakers don’t sound good, it basically doesn’t matter what you connect them to.</p><p>This is understandably the part of their setup that people likely spend the most time researching. And you have to make a number of choices. One of the biggest is: active or passive? Both have their advantages, but for the sake of this guide we’re going to focus on passive speakers, which require a separate amplifier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Active speakers have an amplifier built in. Usually, the two things are specifically designed to work together, which means you&#39;re getting a more faithful version of the manufacturer’s aural vision. And since you don’t need an external amplifier, active speakers also take up less room. While active speakers are more expensive than passive, the fact that you need to buy an amplifier to power passive speakers means the savings aren’t as great as they might initially seem. The primary benefit of passive is greater flexibility. You can’t go out and buy a new high-end amplifier and connect your active speakers to it; you’re stuck with what’s built in. Also, since active speakers require power, you’ll have to make sure they’re near an outlet.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3049351-d9bf-11eb-ae7f-fe41bc844706" alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide" data-uuid="d454e0f9-b1d0-3ddc-ab8d-85e7eb84fd79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>We’re also putting a cap on our spending for this guide: a somewhat arbitrary $600. Anything over that and you’re starting to get into budget audiophile territory. It also basically limits us to bookshelf speakers between five and six inches. While you can certainly get floorstanding speakers for that much, the quality of the drivers will likely be better on bookshelf speakers at the same price point.</p><h2>A note about testing</h2><p>Obviously, I could not test <em>every </em>set of five to six inch bookshelf speakers under $600, but I’ve tried enough and done enough research to feel confident in my recommendations. I’m sure there are other good speakers out there, but I don’t think anyone is going to regret buying the sets here.</p><p>Additionally, speaker preference is largely subjective. But I did my best to be as objective as possible. All of the speakers were connected to a Pyle PSS6 switcher with the same wire for quick side-by-side comparisons. After I’d tested them all myself I enlisted multiple people to listen blindly and then rank them based on their preference to see if their opinions lined up with my own. Testing included playing new and vintage vinyl, as well as streaming songs from Spotify.</p><p>Also worth noting: I am not an audiophile. This is not a guide for audiophiles. I want my music to sound good, but I’m not about to drop the price of a used sedan on my stereo. My setup includes an Audio Technica Audio-Technica AT-LP120 and a Chromecast Audio running through a Technics SA-EX110. This is not fancy stuff, but it is certainly an upgrade from a Crosley Suitcase turntable or even a higher-end Sonos system.</p><h2>The best for most people: Audioengine HDP6</h2><section data-eng-breakout="46ee20427c5440128a85b763ce29ff0f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c304ba60-d9bf-11eb-af6f-c0c19d7f256e" alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide"></section><p>Honestly, a lot of the speakers I tested sounded eerily similar to each other. But not the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$399 Audioengines" href="https://amzn.to/3zLFGst">$399 Audioengines</a>. They had a much brighter sound and a lot more clarity than all the others, with the exception of a significantly more expensive KEF pair. The particular pair I tried also came in a gorgeous “walnut” enclosure that helped them stand out in a sea of utilitarian black.</p><p>The HDP6s deliver especially strong mids that shine when it comes to vocals and guitars. But they sound quite balanced across the entire spectrum. Towering compositions like Nine Inch Nails “The Day the Whole World Went Away” sprung to life and revealed nuances that, frankly, I’ve never noticed before even on headphones. And <em>Promises</em>, the recent album from Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra, was so enveloping it made me want to throw my current floorstanding speakers in the trash.</p><p>While no bookshelf speakers on their own are going to be able to deliver the sort of room-shaking thump that floorstanding speakers or a subwoofer can deliver, the HDP6 performed admirably with bass-heavy songs. They didn’t have the most low end of my test units, but drums and bass were still punchy and clear.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Audioengine HDP6 at Amazon - $399" href="https://amzn.to/3zLFGst">Buy Audioengine HDP6 at Amazon - $399</a></p><h2>For those who want the best sound: KEF Q150</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3046c41-d9bf-11eb-bccd-3201c6a408f7" alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide" data-uuid="4a9557b5-aa77-3906-8384-260e7b4cff32"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>If your number one concern is sound quality, regardless of anything else, check out the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Q150s" href="https://fave.co/3h0Yn2w">Q150s</a>. These are the entry-level option from noted audiophile brand KEF and the only speakers that beat out the Audioengines in any of my blind taste tests. They didn’t come out on top every time, and some people had trouble deciding between the two, but ultimately I think the KEF’s have the slight edge in pure sound quality. They had a bit more volume at the extreme lower and higher ends of the spectrum. It added a certain sparkle to tracks like the Beach Boys’ “Wouldn’t it Be Nice,” while Run the Jewels’ “JU$T” hit a little bit harder than on the HDP6s. The difference can be subtle depending on what you’re listening to, but it’s undeniable in side-by-side testing.</p><p>The audio profile of the KEF is similar to that of the Audioengines. They’re both much brighter and with a lot more treble and midrange than all the other speakers in this roundup. If you’re into listening to classical or jazz on high quality vinyl, these are going to deliver exactly the sort of frequency response you’re looking for.</p><p>What stops the Q150 from topping this list is the list price. At $600 they&#39;re essentially tied for the most expensive speakers I tested. (The <a href="https://fave.co/3d8yGvR">Polk R100s</a> were $599, but didn’t make the final cut.) While the Q150s sounded slightly better than the HDP6s to my ears, they weren’t necessarily $200 better. At the time of this writing, however, the Q150s were on sale for $400, making them a compelling option to the Audioengines.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy KEF Q150 at Crunchfield - $399" href="https://fave.co/3h0Yn2w">Buy KEF Q150 at Crunchfield - $400</a></p><h2>For the bargain hunter: JBL A130</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3046c40-d9bf-11eb-b7f1-18a6f5125771" alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide" data-uuid="2244939e-dac0-3a7d-8859-cbc174376590"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBLs" href="https://fave.co/35N0lyw">JBLs</a> were pretty consistently in the middle of the pack when it came to listener preference. They’re not as bright as the KEFs and the Audioengines, but not quite as muddy at the lowend as the Polk S15s. If you’re just looking for a decent set of speakers and don’t sweat over spec sheets, or if you’re primarily listening to streaming music and only putting on vinyl occasionally, these are a great option if you can find them on sale.</p><p>The A130s aren’t a bad deal at the list price of $300. But I’ve seen them discounted to as little as $180, at which point they’re a downright steal.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy JBL A130 at B&amp;H Photo - $300" href="https://fave.co/35N0lyw">Buy JBL A130 at B&amp;H Photo - $300</a></p><h2>For those that need more bass: ELAC Debut 2.0 DB6.2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3046c43-d9bf-11eb-aff7-0aae788dadc1" alt="Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide" data-uuid="5ea8bb9b-7b50-3df6-b69b-ea291ef6d99b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Ok, so these speakers break our rules a bit but, if you opt for the slightly larger 6.5-inch DB6.2s, instead of the DB5.2s, you get a lot more thump at the bottom end. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Debuts" href="https://amzn.to/3d8Vega">Debuts</a> can’t quite match the Audioengine or KEFs when it comes to clarity, but you’ll feel every 808 hit a lot more. Backxwash’s new album <em>I Lie Here Buried with my Rings and my Dresses</em> raged harder on the ELACs than it did on the Polks, JBLs or even the KEFs. And they only cost $350, which isn’t bad at all.</p><p>If you’re primarily listening to electronic music and modern hip hop, you might consider the Debut 2.0 DB6.2s.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy ELAC Debut 2.0 DB6.2 at Amazon - $350" href="https://amzn.to/3d8Vega">Buy ELAC Debut 2.0 DB6.2 at Amazon - $350</a></p><h2>For those who want to ignore my advice:</h2><h3>Polk S15</h3><p>If you can’t find the JBL A130s on sale, and really want to save as much money as possible, you could snag the <a href="https://fave.co/3qiBuMi">Polk S15s</a>. The S15s don’t sound <em>bad</em>, but the JBLs are definitely superior. They don’t have as deep of a soundstage as the other speakers I tested and the lowend can be a little undefined. These are probably better suited as part of a home entertainment system than a stereo. At a list price of $229 they might seem like a bargain, but I’d save your pennies for a bit longer and spring for something better.</p><h3>Polk R100</h3><p>The <a href="https://fave.co/3d8yGvR">Polk R100s</a> are decent sounding speakers. Perhaps slightly better than the JBLs, though with a sound profile closer to the Polk’s own S15. The problem is they’re $600, tying them for the most expensive I tested. At half the price these might be a solid option, but the $600 KEFs and $400 Audioengines were ranked higher than the R100s by every tester.</p><h3>Q Acoustics 3020i</h3><p>I have no doubt that <a href="https://amzn.to/3qhowys">these</a> are very good speakers: They’re currently <em>Wirecutter</em>’s top choice. But I could not test them and therefore cannot vouch for them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-best-passive-bookshelf-speakers-under-600-dollars-for-most-people-140057354.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fbc75bf0-9cde-49f1-a066-0743b2bc4a72</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625150651</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T14:44:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c304e170-d9bf-11eb-bd67-9645d103c50e" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c304e170-d9bf-11eb-bd67-9645d103c50e" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinterest bans all weight-loss ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/pinterest">Pinterest</a> has announced a complete ban on weight-loss ads, which goes into effect today. The policy builds on previous rules that prohibited ads for weight-loss or appetite-suppressant pills and supplements, liposuction and fat-burning procedures and body shaming.</p><p>There&#39;s now a blanket ban on ads with any weight-loss language or images, and those that reference Body Mass Index (BMI) or similar indexes. Testimonials about weight loss or weight-loss products are prohibited, as are language and images that denigrate or idealize body types. Additionally, you&#39;ll no longer see ads for products that claim to enable weight loss through something that&#39;s worn or applied to the skin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ads related to fitness products and services, and those promoting healthy habits and lifestyles, are still welcome. However, any that focus on weight loss won&#39;t be approved.</p><p>Pinterest developed the updated policy with the support of the National Eating Disorders Association. The organization <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-pandemic-eating-disorders/">said in March</a> it had seen a 41 percent increase in helpline calls during the previous 12 months, and <a href="https://uncexchanges.org/2020/06/01/the-early-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-with-eating-disorders/">studies have suggested</a> the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on many people with eating disorders. Whenever someone searches for content related to eating disorders on Pinterest, the company redirects that person to NEDA to provide them with helpful resources.</p><p>The company says its community has been embracing body neutrality, with searchers for that term, and quotes related to &quot;healthy mindset,&quot; &quot;stop body shaming&quot; and &quot;body acceptance&quot; rising dramatically over the past year or so. Pinterest will highlight related pins from creators on the Today Tab &quot;to showcase those reimagining the relationship with their bodies.&quot;</p><p>Pinterest says it&#39;s the first major platform to ban all weight loss ads and it urged others to do the same. Instagram and Facebook have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-instagram-will-restrict-posts-on-cosmetic-surgery-and-diet-prod.html">restricted</a> ads for diet products. Instagram also points users searching for eating disorder-related terms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-nedawarness-week-resources-221528472.html">toward NEDA resources</a>. Last year, TikTok <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-body-image-policy-193208999.html">prohibited</a> ads for weight-loss supplements and those that “promote a harmful or negative body image.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-weight-loss-ad-ban-130049016.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9ee80f3-4123-4017-b47d-21a163da7243</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 13:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625148347</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T14:06:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diet & Weight Loss]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9eb7b2a0-d5e8-11eb-bb39-6efd9a4be8e3" width="3200" height="2129" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9eb7b2a0-d5e8-11eb-bb39-6efd9a4be8e3" width="3200" height="2129" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2020/10/20: In this photo illustration a Pinterest logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

The 44mm model is down to $429 — that&#39;s $100 off its normal price and the best we&#39;ve seen it. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:40mm version" href="https://amzn.to/3yhOB3f">40mm version</a> is also $100 off, bringing it down to $399, although we have seen it $10 less than that in the past.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $399" href="https://amzn.to/3yhOB3f">Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (40mm, GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $399</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm, GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $429" href="https://amzn.to/3ya4DMs">Buy Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm, GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $429</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from the red case and band color, the other caveat to this deal is that you&#39;ll have to wait to get your new gadget. Amazon currently estimates delivery for the 44mm model in about one month — not ideal, but a decent tradeoff for the $100 savings. If you opt for the 40mm model, your wait time will only be about two weeks.</p><p>Apple made small improvements to the overall experience of using the Apple Watch in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Series 6</a>, while also adding some new sensors into the mix. It runs on an S6 processor that&#39;s 20 percent faster than the chipset in the Series 5, and the battery life has been slightly improved. Also, Apple sped up the charging time for the Series 6 — we got a 51-percent increase in battery life after only a half hour of charging.</p><p>The Series 6 adds a blood oxygen sensor to its array of internal trackers, which also includes an ECG sensor, a heart rate monitor, altimeter, compass and more. WatchOS 7 added new features as well including native sleep tracking (which is much easier to do now that the Watch&#39;s battery life and charge time have improved) and a hand-washing timer. While the less expensive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/3w9AhIs">Apple Watch SE</a> is best for those new to wearables in general, the Series 6 is our pick for those that want the most comprehensive Apple Watch experience.</p><p>But we&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that September is slowly approaching, and that&#39;s when Apple tends to release the latest Apple Watches. Holding out until the fall is probably best for anyone who wants to ensure they&#39;re getting the latest and greatest from Apple.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-gps-lte-product-red-edition-deal-amazon-123944170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">22586632-28cc-41cf-a29d-401c3b773644</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 12:39:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625143594</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T12:46:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/13e913f0-a80f-11eb-8eae-48b04790c8d3" width="963" height="620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/13e913f0-a80f-11eb-8eae-48b04790c8d3" width="963" height="620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic leak suggests a more familiar design]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-wear-os-leak-152254285.html">Active 4</a> may not be the only Samsung smartwatch to feature its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">new OS</a> built with Google. <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic"><em>Android Headlines</em></a> has published leaked pics of a new device it claims is the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.

Both <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/over-78-million-verizon-customers-protected-over-13-billion-unwanted-calls">Verizon</a> and <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/press/t-mobile-calls-are-100-stir-shaken-compliant">T-Mobile</a> announced yesterday that all calls originating on their networks are 100 percent compliant with the FCC&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://transnexus.com/whitepapers/stir-and-shaken-overview/">STIR/SHAKEN</a>&quot; technology designed to show a caller&#39;s true phone number. AT&amp;T, meanwhile, confirmed with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557539/t-mobile-verizon-carriers-fcc-stir-shaken-certification-deadline-spam-calls"><em>The Verge</em></a> that it&#39;s also in compliance with the new rules.&nbsp;</p><p>The FCC had set a deadline of June 30th for the major carrier&#39;s to implement the STIR/SHAKEN protocol developed under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-fcc-caller-id-authentication-2019.html">Ajit Pai regime</a>. For now, smaller carriers have until June 30th, 2023 unless the FCC decides to shorten that timespan, something that&#39;s currently <a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373714A1.pdf">under consideration</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>The STIR/SHAKEN standards serve as a common digital language used by phone networks, allowing valid information to pass from provider to provider which, among other things, informs blocking tools of possible suspicious calls.</p></blockquote><p>So what does the new protocol do? Without it, scam or spam callers can spoof their phone numbers to show up as local numbers, making it more likely that you&#39;ll pick up. STIR/SHAKEN deals with that by using public key encryption digital certificates sent by the originating telephone service provider, with the keys verified by the terminating service provider. If everything matches, then the calling number hasn&#39;t been spoofed.&nbsp;</p><p>The FCC is hoping that carrier implementation will reduce the volume of spam, scam and robocalls that have made answering your phone a game of whack-a-mole. The commission said that over 1,500 voice providers have filed to be in its robocall mitigation database with over 200 of those being fully certified. &quot;Beginning on September 28, 2021, if a voice service provider’s certification does not appear in the database, intermediate and voice service providers will be prohibited from directly accepting the provider’s traffic,&quot; the FCC stated.&nbsp;</p><p>The protocol will help reduce but not totally eliminate scams or robocalls. Legacy phone systems that don&#39;t use IP protocols are exempt from the rules, and the system won&#39;t work with international calls. Still, if a local pops up on your phone going forward, you can have more confidence that it&#39;s not a fake number coming from a scammer.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/major-carriers-implemented-fcc-anti-spoofing-spam-calls-090503217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">011b84af-7264-46c4-994b-679398c18fb1</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 09:05:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625130344</ingested><modified>2021-07-01T09:05:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/412db570-399f-11eb-b7fb-e83e824fca3e" width="3500" height="2361" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/412db570-399f-11eb-b7fb-e83e824fca3e" width="3500" height="2361" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yuri Gripas / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) logo is seen before the FCC Net Neutrality hearing in Washington February 26, 2015.
