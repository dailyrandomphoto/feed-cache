On Friday, the company announced the existence of <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441447381279539204?s=20"><em>Kate: Collateral Damage</em></a>. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-eden-unearthed-vr-oculus-214541602.html"><em><ins>Eden Unearthed</ins></em></a>, the VR experience we saw make the media rounds earlier in the week, the new game is a tie-in to a recently released Netflix original. In this case, it’s here to promote the release of action thriller <em>Kate</em>, which stars Mary Elizabeth Winstead as a deadly assassin<em>.</em></p><div id="9e09e043a6254975bc331fe17ca08f1f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MysGjRS9jFU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Netflix describes <em>Kate: Collateral Damage</em> as an time-attack, action roguelike. If you’ve played games like <em>Hotline Miami</em> and <em>Katana Zero</em>, you have a good idea of the setup.  Each enemy in <em>Kate: Collateral Damage</em> only takes a single hit or two to dispatch, but the same is true of your character.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Much like in the movie, Kate is poisoned by a substance called Polonium 204, leaving her with only 24 hours to live. How that plays out in the game is that the more efficiently you can take out enemies, the more time you’ll have to complete a run. Since most firearms have limited ammo, you’ll also need to get creative and adapt your tactics to the moment.</p><div id="9faf68be50f4434fa66b41fd2e6d6af6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The clock is ticking, you have 24 hours and ONLY revenge on your mind. 🔥 KATE: COLLATERAL DAMAGE is coming to Steam on October 22nd. <a href="https://t.co/8HHGqty3GS">pic.twitter.com/8HHGqty3GS</a></p>— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441447381279539204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Kate: Collateral Damage</em> arrives on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623000/?curator_clanid=4777282&amp;utm_source=SteamDB">Steam</a> on October 22nd.

Jeep will debut the long-awaited 2022 Grand Cherokee, including the nameplate’s first-ever 4xe plug-in hybrid model, on September 29th at 9AM ET, the automaker <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=23136&amp;mid=898">announced today</a>. Jeep had initially planned to debut the 2022 Grand Cherokee in August at the 2021 New York Auto Show, but that plan went out the window when the event was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-new-york-auto-show-canceled-190749186.html">canceled</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>We got our first good look at the SUV when Jeep <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-4xe-2025-plan-200527710.html">shared its updated electrification</a> plans in July. Unsurprisingly, it looked a lot like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-grand-cherokee-l-050100377.html">Grand Cherokee L</a> but with a shorter wheelbase. The upcoming 4xe model is expected to feature the same gasoline-electric powertrain as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-sahara-4-xe-phev-first-drive-174554804.html">2021 Wrangler 4xe</a>. That SUV can output a combined 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Its 4xe models are becoming increasingly important to Jeep. In July, the automaker said it expects electric vehicles to account for 70 percent of all of its sales by mid-decade. To that end, it plans to offer a “fully electric” 4xe model in every SUV category it sells by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jeep-2022-grand-cherokee-4xe-debut-september-29-173239673.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079d3130-2b6d-4323-b669-6e6df5b56722</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 17:32:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632504764</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T17:32:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b483540-e024-11eb-be26-92d3282c47e3" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b483540-e024-11eb-be26-92d3282c47e3" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeep]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Justice Department will reportedly let Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou return to China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou that will let her return home to China, pending a judge&#39;s approval.

Biden admin officials reopened the talks in recent weeks, according to reports, and with Meng seemingly seeking a reunion with her family, she may have been more open to a compromise. A judge in Vancouver was expected to rule on Meng&#39;s possible extradition to the US later this year, following almost two years of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-cfo-extradition-allowed-in-canada-ruling-194024350.html">hearings</a>.</p><p>Huawei and its subsidiaries are still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-13-justice-department-huawei-charges.html">facing charges in the US</a>, including conspiracy to steal trade secrets and racketeering conspiracy.

In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html"><ins>banned the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered</ins></a> vehicles by 2035. That same year, the state’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html"><ins>Air Resources Board</ins></a> mandated that all new trucks sold in California emit zero emissions by 2045.</p><p>“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement to Engadget. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero-emissions fleet from the start.” Cruise backed SB 500 through its involvement with the <a href="https://www.emissionzero.net/"><ins>Emission Zero Coalition</ins></a>, a group that also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html"><ins>autonomous delivery startup Nuro</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency</ins></a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse emissions in the US since 2019, with light-duty vehicles accounting for more than half of that output. However, autonomous cars currently represent only a tiny fraction of the nearly 15 million vehicles on California roads. Moreover, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html"><ins>Cruise</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-san-francisco-trusted-tester-170602490.html"><ins>Waymo</ins></a>, two of the most prominent companies testing fully autonomous taxi services in the state, utilize fleets made almost exclusively of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html"><ins>electric</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-19-google-waymo-chrysler-self-driving-minivan.html"><ins>hybrid</ins></a> vehicles. This latest move from California then is about preventing autonomous vehicles from becoming major polluters in the future, particularly if driverless taxi services become popular among commuters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-zero-emissions-autonomous-vehicles-2030-162009922.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80ae15a5-a503-4588-9e29-3cea1b936d72</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632500415</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T16:20:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cdbedb0-1d52-11ec-bfe9-57240ffb77ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cdbedb0-1d52-11ec-bfe9-57240ffb77ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cruise]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cruise car in San Francisco]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cruise car in San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 is $150 off, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week brought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2021-event-recap-185020522.html">new Surface devices</a> and a bunch of tech deals across the web.

They attempt to get to the bottom of the suspicious death of crypto exchange founder Gerald Cotten and figure out what actually happened to the $250 million they think he stole from them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cotten was the founder of QuadrigaCX, said to be the biggest crypto exchange in Canada for a spell. He died in December 2018 of Crohn&#39;s disease complications. According to his widow, Jennifer Robertson, Cotten was the only one who knew the passwords to QuadrigaCX&#39;s offline crypto storage, meaning that digital currency that was worth around $200 million CAD in early 2019 was no longer accessible.</p><p>However, internet sleuths uncovered some eyebrow-raising details about the saga. For one thing, Cotten wrote a will a month before his death in which he left all of his assets to Robertson. There were also suggestions QuadrigaCX didn&#39;t have enough cash on hand to pay all of its creditors and even that Cotten <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-documentary-quadrigacx-ceo/">faked his death</a> and disappeared with the money. The company ceased operations in 2019 after it was declared bankrupt.</p><p>The FBI started investigating that year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-quadrigacx-bitcoin-fbi-ir.html"><ins>seeking information</ins></a> from those who lost money after Cotten&#39;s death and QuadrigaCX&#39;s collapse. It remains to be seen whether the documentary will include any concrete details about the resolution of the saga, but it should at least direct the spotlight toward one of the more curious crypto cases of recent years.</p><p>Also on the way to Netflix is <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1441040133193568270"><em><ins>The Tinder Swindler</ins></em></a>, a documentary about a conman who posed as a billionaire on the dating app and the women who tried to stop him. That documentary will start streaming in February.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-documentary-quadrigacx-bitcoin-gerald-cotten-150253816.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bf353cb-1920-475f-a4d9-99fd2a9dd24e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 15:02:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632495777</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T15:03:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/188a5d40-1d46-11ec-b3f7-03269028f311" width="2852" height="1598" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/188a5d40-1d46-11ec-b3f7-03269028f311" width="2852" height="1598" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Text reading "A Netflix Documentary.

That’s why the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">iPhone 13 Pro’s most important new feature is its ProMotion</a> display.</p><p>But ProMotion is only included on the Pro and Pro Max models this year, making it one of the features that differentiate them from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13 and 13 mini</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">last year’s 12 Pro</a>. For an extra $200 to $300, the Pro series also offers an additional telephoto camera, a new macro photography mode, as well as more power and endurance. But are the iPhone 13 Pro’s new cameras and screens worth the extra money?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>Before we get into those features, though, there’s one thing you should consider: weight. At 204 grams (7.19 ounces), the 6.1-inch 13 Pro is heavier than both the 12 Pro and the iPhone 13. The 13 Pro Max, which has a 6.7-inch screen, outweighs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-cameras-battery-price-233156949.html">last year’s Pro Max</a> and Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-specs-price-cameras-snapdragon-888-160013665.html">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>. While I didn’t mind the regular Pro, it was uncomfortable to use Apple’s biggest flagship one-handed for more than a few minutes at a time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cb811cb0-1cfe-11ec-b6f5-fb4009179dfb" alt="An iPhone 13 Pro Max in Sierra Blue" data-uuid="c3403808-ace5-3796-969a-43c6c5b1e123"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>In addition to being heavier than last year&#39;s models, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are a bit thicker, too. They also have larger rear camera modules and slightly smaller display notches. Otherwise, Apple hasn’t strayed far from the 12 Pro’s design. These phones have similar stainless steel enclosures with glass coverings, and are rated IP68 for water and dust resistance.</p><p>Even the colors available are familiar: The typical trio of graphite, gold and silver are now accompanied by Sierra Blue. Personally, I prefer this paler shade to the Pacific Blue offered on the last generation.</p><h2>Display and audio</h2><p>I realized something when I started testing the iPhone 13 series last week: Basically everything I do on a phone requires scrolling. That includes browsing social feeds, looking for the right component on a spec sheet, reading through old conversations, creeping on my Instagram viewers and reading articles, to give you a non-exhaustive list.</p><p><em>This </em>is why Apple’s new ProMotion screen on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max is a big deal, and also why it’s kind of annoying that it took the company so long to adopt this technology in the first place. Google was already a little behind when it added 90Hz panels to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">the Pixel 4</a>, after companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-asus-rog-phone-ii-gaming-hands-on.html">ASUS</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-oneplus-7-pro-review.html">OnePlus</a> had already introduced higher refresh rates. Nowadays, this tech isn&#39;t just for premium, top-tier Android devices either.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" alt="The iPhone 13 Pro, held face up in a person&#39;s hand, with the iOS 15 home screen in view." data-uuid="91300510-2b0c-3fae-8d53-3a2aa2e54722"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This is hardly the first time Apple is late to adopt a new technology. But it is worth emphasizing that the faster screens on the iPhones make a real difference. Like many Android phones, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adjust their refresh rates depending on what you’re doing. They can go as low as 10Hz when you’re looking at a static image, or up to 120Hz for scrolling and compatible games.</p><p>The benefits might not be obvious at first, but when you go back to a slower screen, you’ll quickly notice the jagged artifacts they produce.</p><p>Aside from ProMotion, the iPhone 13 Pro’s OLED displays are also 25 percent brighter than their predecessors, which is nice for outdoor reading. But without a side-by-side comparison, the difference is subtle at best.</p><p>Regardless, I enjoyed watching the visual perfection that is Doja Cat’s <em>Kiss Me More</em> music video on the iPhone 13 Pro’s True Tone display. The rosy, cotton-candy hues looked vibrant and her individual lashes were clear. The stereo speakers also did a respectable job of delivering crisp audio with adequate bass. Other things like voices and instrumental background music in videos and games all came through clearly as well.</p><section data-eng-breakout="75c76fee4e104d248d72c7e2a5593a63" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b064ae0-1cff-11ec-b8fd-3e4f4674243c" alt="Close up of the gold iPhone 13 Pro&#39;s triple rear cameras"></section><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro’s rear cameras have received the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/">biggest upgrade ever</a>,” touting “next-level hardware that captures so much more detail.” The triple 12-megapixel setup includes a primary sensor with a large f/1.5 aperture, a 77mm telephoto lens and an ultra-wide option with a 120-degree field of view. Night mode is now supported on all three of the cameras, so you don’t have to compromise on wide-angle or close up shots in low light. There’s also a new macro photography feature thanks to the updated ultra-wide lens, along with software like Photographic Styles and Cinematic Mode.</p><p>Those two modes are also offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, and you can read my review of those phones for more details. In short, Photographic Styles lets you easily customize and set a sort of default for the contrast levels and color temperature of your images. Meanwhile, Cinematic Mode is good at identifying faces and people in a scene and blurring out everything surrounding a subject, but it struggled when I tried to change the focal point. The system is also a little wonky at outlining individuals, and stray body parts like thumbs and ears can get eaten up in the artificial blur. I found that adjusting the intensity via the f-stop setting helped keep this problem at bay, but the trade-off was less of a DSLR-like look in the final video.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/80e5ba20-1cff-11ec-ae9b-9ac58c12e753" alt="Cinematic Mode on iPhone 13" data-uuid="9247c551-ec54-35e6-b562-06a220987ca4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>One feature the Pros have over the regular 13 is macro photography. With this generation, you can get as close as two centimeters away from your subject and not lose focus. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t offer a way to manually enable a macro mode; the system automatically switches to the close-up camera when you get all up in something’s face.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro was generally accurate at detecting when I was trying to get a tight shot, but it kept changing back and forth between macro and regular views. Sometimes it would continually focus and refocus on the flowers behind the buds I was trying to shoot. The latter is a more understandable issue; every little hand tremor is magnified when a camera is zoomed that far in, making it hard to latch on to a subject. Not to mention something in motion, like a leaf in the wind. But that’s all the more reason to give users manual control.</p><p>Apple has said it will be releasing a software update soon that should prevent the camera from switching in and out of macro mode, which I of course can&#39;t vouch for yet.</p><p>When it worked as expected, macro mode delivered surprisingly great results. My shots of a closed flower bud and the vein system on a leaf’s surface were impressively detailed, showing individual hairs on the stem and petals. Close-ups of a fried fish clearly rendered the oil oozing out of the batter.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b174b54d-4a79-4497-bc6d-0fd255c83e41"/><p>You need to make sure to let enough light shine on your subject, though, because my shots of a bee inside a flower were dark and splotchy. But that’s basically Photography 101; it’s not an issue specific to macro mode.</p><p>In general, the iPhone 13 Pro took sharp, colorful photos rivaling my sample shots from the Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21 Ultra. Apple’s default treatment renders pictures that are typically brighter and sometimes more saturated, but with Photographic Styles you can pick a look that you like and stick with it. I’m not a fan of the iPhone’s aggressive HDR effects compared to the Pixels’ more neutral landscapes, but frankly we’re at a point where Samsung, Google and Apple are generally on par in terms of sheer quality.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro’s upgraded sensors also really improved low light performance. I took photos of the moon peeking through some clouds in the middle of Manhattan skyscrapers with the S21 Ultra, Pixel 5 and iPhone 13 Pro, and they were all clean and sharp. They differed a bit in color temperature, but it’s not noticeable without a direct comparison. Google still retains an advantage with Night Sight, though; it produces photos that are significantly cleaner, brighter and richer in detail.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/af929460-1cff-11ec-b0fb-1ac4511b656e" alt="A medium shot of the notch housing the iPhone 13 Pro&#39;s front camera." data-uuid="076d969f-1629-3715-b4a0-cae28c0ce2a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>As for the 13 Pro’s front camera, it’s pretty much the same as the iPhone 13’s, and that’s not a bad thing. You’ll still get Cinematic Mode and Photographic Styles via the 12-megapixel True Depth sensor, and though selfies were a little soft in low light, they were otherwise sharp.</p><p>Because these are Pro-series phones, Apple also threw in support for ProRes videos in addition to its ProRAW format for stills... or at least it will eventually. ProRes won’t be available until a future iOS 15 update arrives at an unspecified date, but it promises to preserve colors at high quality. And, thanks to the A15’s hardware acceleration plus video encoders and decoders, you’ll be able to record in the format at up to 4K resolution (1080p for the base 128GB model) and 30 frames per second.</p><h2>iOS 15</h2><p>Speaking of, the iPhone 13 series runs iOS 15 out of the box, and I was able to test most of the new features when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">I tested the beta version</a>. Focus modes, for example, let you set custom home pages and notification profiles based on your location or time of day. It’s one of my favorite new features on any smartphone platform in recent years because it allows people without a separate work device to switch off from work when they please.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c976ff60-1cff-11ec-9ffb-1dbc9d9986b4" alt="An iPhone 13 Pro standing on a fabric surface with its screen facing the camera." data-uuid="4d04c0c5-3991-305f-9505-4be457d9e531"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Since most of iOS 15’s new features will be coming to older iPhones, though, they’re unlikely to sway your decision on whether to upgrade. We’ll have a more in-depth review of iOS 15, but suffice to say I appreciate the level of control it offers. I’m especially looking forward to testing out SharePlay, which hasn&#39;t rolled out yet, but will let you watch shows with or stream your phone screen to friends over FaceTime.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>The main difference between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro’s processors is that the latter uses a beefier 5-core GPU. This means that graphics-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing should be executed more quickly. I made a trailer in iMovie and while I had to wait 51 seconds for it to finish exporting on the iPhone 13, it took a mere 15 seconds on the Pro.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro’s A15 Bionic chip is similarly powerful in less-intensive tasks. I played rounds of <em>Catan</em>, watched various YouTube videos, chatted with friends, played music and snapped photos in rapid succession — all without any delay. And I know I’ve already said this a lot, but I have to stress again that the faster screens here just make most tasks feel more responsive.</p><p>In the week or so that I’ve had the iPhone 13 Pros, I’ve only needed to charge them twice. Granted, I spent most of the first few days focusing on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, using the Pros predominantly when I was doing intensive camera testing. But when I switched over to the more-premium devices, the iPhone 13 Pro lasted almost a full two days before needing a charge. Battery levels dipped more quickly when I was playing games and exporting videos, but not so much that I had to worry about running out of juice.</p><p>Considering its higher refresh rate, that’s an impressive runtime. I’m still running battery tests across the iPhone 13 lineup, and will update this review with more empirical results as soon as that’s done. For now, though, it’s clear that despite the ProMotion displays, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max can last longer than a day.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f1922dd0-1cff-11ec-bdde-90058ea15718" alt="A blue iPhone 13 Pro Mac and a gold iPhone 13 Pro next to each other on a table with their rear cameras facing us." data-uuid="b123ee1c-4c03-3fed-800e-fe42028b6791"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>With faster screens, superb performance and long-lasting batteries, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones. If you’re on a device older than a 12 Pro, you should consider upgrading just<em> for</em> the new ProMotion displays. Though the cameras also got a noteworthy improvement, I’m not sure they’re going to be the biggest draw. It’s honestly hard to spot the difference in quality between photos taken by Apple’s recent flagships.</p><p>Features like Cinematic Mode, Photographic Styles and macro cameras are nice to have, but won’t define your iPhone 13 Pro experience. And though Apple was playing catch up to Android flagships by finally introducing 120Hz screens to its phones, there are now fewer things that Samsung and Google offer that the iPhones don’t. But for basically anyone who uses iOS, the iPhone 13 Pro (and Pro Max, if you don’t mind its weight) is a worthy upgrade.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13 Pro)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB or 1TB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with ProMotion up to 120Hz</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,532 x 1,170 (460 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.5 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS;

display]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is working on a number of new devices including an Echo with a 15-inch wall-mounted display, a soundbar, new Echo Auto technology and wearables. Some may appear fairly soon at the company&#39;s September 28th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fall-hardware-event-september-28-181440028.html">hardware event</a>, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/amazon-working-on-large-wall-echo-sound-bar-and-new-auto-device"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.&nbsp;</p><p>The splashiest-looking product would be an Alexa-enabled Echo with a display size around 15-inches. Codenamed Hoya, it could not only be placed on a stand like a regular Echo device, but mounted on a wall as well. It would serve as a smart-home center to control lights, cameras, locks and other devices, while showing weather, timers, appointments, photos and more. It&#39;s specifically designed to work in the kitchen, displaying recipes and YouTube cooking videos, while letting you stream Netflix and other apps.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company may also announce its own soundbar, codenamed Harmony, to accompany a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html">rumored lineup</a> of Amazon-branded TVs. Unlike third-party Alexa-enabled soundbars, it would have a front-facing camera and support video calls from TVs, much like Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html">Portal TV</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, it&#39;s reportedly developing a new version of Echo Auto (codenamed Marion). The updated version will supposedly have a new design and allow for device charging via inductive technology. Amazon currently has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-alexa-built-in-120032156.html">partnership with Ford</a> to put Alexa in 700,000 vehicles, but it&#39;s apparently looking to team up with other automakers, too.</p><p>Other items in the works include new Echo speakers for 2022 and wearables for kids and seniors (the latter with fall detection). It&#39;s also reportedly building dedicated processors to improve artificial intelligence along with new technology to help its Fire TV, Echo and other devices work better together.&nbsp;</p><p>The company has some other, somewhat more unusual products in the works as well, according to the report. It has been working on a home robot codenamed Vesta that would use the Alexa interface and also an Alexa-powered karaoke microphone — though the team working on the latter project was reportedly disbanded.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-reportedly-planning-an-echo-with-a-15-inch-display-122607832.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44735d84-b327-41a0-97e2-d3dcb1e665d4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 12:26:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632486564</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T12:29:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/003f43d0-1d2e-11ec-9aef-879c692355fb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/003f43d0-1d2e-11ec-9aef-879c692355fb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon is reportedly planning a wall-mounted Echo with a 15-inch display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon is reportedly planning a wall-mounted Echo with a 15-inch display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dell XPS 15 OLED review: A practically perfect 15-inch laptop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p><div id="1a71aef51ebd4a69a4b59241af3c7207"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GaWcYXHUzTw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>OLED makes Dell&#39;s already excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 15" href="https://bit.ly/3lOELBj">XPS 15</a> even better. That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all you need to know. I&#39;ve seen dozens of OLED screens over the last decade, and they never fail to impress. By their very nature they look bolder and capture inky blacks better than most LCD screens. So take that together with the latest hardware from Intel and NVIDIA, and you&#39;ve got a surefire ultraportable powerhouse.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6a145e1d-6327-4b26-ba92-6b557ed5524c"/><p>Now, if you remember last year&#39;s redesigned XPS 15 you&#39;ll probably have a hard time telling this new model apart. It still has a sturdy and thin aluminum unibody case, but the star of the show is the 15.6-inch display. It has some of the thinnest bezels on the market, which almost makes the screen seem as if it&#39;s floating in the air. New this year is the 3.5K OLED touchscreen model, but you can also choose from two LCD panels: a 4K+ touchscreen and a 1080p+ display. The plus on those resolutions just means they pack a few more vertical pixels to reach a 16 x 10 aspect ratio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While I&#39;m clearly partial to what OLED adds to the experience, all of the displays should look great. They each support Dolby Vision HDR, and the LCD models are also fairly bright at 500 nits. The OLED version maxes out at 400 nits, but the vastly better contrast should make up for it. It&#39;s also the only screen that supports 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut, making it ideal for artists who demand color accuracy.</p><p>I&#39;ll admit: I&#39;m mainly reviewing the XPS 15 to gawk at its screen. As soon as I powered it up, I put on the <em>Matrix Resurrections</em> trailer in 4K HDR just to see if it looked better than my OLED TV. Of course the TV looked better, but I was still impressed by the XPS 15. The glimpses we see at night look truly black, bright elements like explosions and sunlight were so brilliant they made me tear up a bit, and it managed to juggle scenes that had <em>both</em> bright and dark aspects. That&#39;s the advantage of OLED.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7dacc08d02124613867835f46506e967" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fda7533-1c97-11ec-bb37-e3dcfd4bbaa9" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED"></section><p>To push the XPS 15&#39;s display to the max, I turned to Ang Lee&#39;s <em>Gemini Man</em>, one of the few films viewable in 4K with HDR at 60 frames per second. Say what you will about the movie, but the OLED screen made the shootout between Will Smith and his younger clone feel almost as thrilling as watching it in theaters. Sure, it doesn&#39;t have a full 4K resolution, but that&#39;s not something you&#39;ll really notice while watching it. Another bonus: Dell&#39;s upward-firing speakers did a decent job throughout most of the action.</p><p>Outside of video, the XPS 15&#39;s OLED screen made looking at just about everything a joy. I&#39;ve never had so much fun scrolling through text-heavy websites — even jotting ideas down in Evernote felt a bit more satisfying, thanks to the ultra crisp text. Photos just about popped off the screen, as you&#39;d expect. The DCI-P3 color range is around 25 percent wider than the more common sRGB, which means images will be able to show off more depth.</p><p>The only way the XPS 15&#39;s screen could look better was if it took a cue from gaming laptops and offered a faster refresh rate. Going above 60Hz makes scrolling images and text look instantly smoother, but it&#39;ll likely be a few years before work-focused notebooks take advantage of that tech.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark Night Raid</p></td><td><p>ATTO disk speeds (top read/write)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 (Intel i7-11800H, NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti 45w)</p></td><td><p>5,966</p></td><td><p>22,264</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s / 2.6 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 (Intel i7-10875H, NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti)</p></td><td><p>3,962</p></td><td><p>18,500</p></td><td><p>3 GB/s / 2.4 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Surface Laptop 4 15&quot; (AMD Ryzen 7 4980U Surface Edition, Radeon)</p></td><td><p>4,620</p></td><td><p>15,517</p></td><td><p>1.9 GB/s / 985 MB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ZenBook Duo (Intel Core i7-1165G7, Xe graphics)</p></td><td><p>4,704</p></td><td><p>15,315</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.48 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Our XPS 15 review unit was powered by an eight-core Intel i7-11800H, 16GB of RAM and a 45-watt version of NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti GPU. That&#39;s on the low-end of that GPU&#39;s potential power usage — it can go all the way up to 80 watts — which means it&#39;s far less capable than the same card in a gaming notebook. Still, it should be a huge upgrade from last year&#39;s GTX 1650 Ti. In the GPU-focused Geekbench 5 Compute benchmark, for example, the XPS 15 notched around 6,000 more points than last year&#39;s model.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine too many people will be judging the XPS 15 on its gaming capabilities, not when you can get faster screens and potentially better hardware for similar prices from dedicated laptops. But if you&#39;re just itching to get a bit of <em>Overwatch</em> action in once in a while, it&#39;s good enough to reach 70fps in Overwatch at 2,560 by 1,600 (1,440p+) at the highest graphics settings. Honestly, it has enough power to tackle most modern games. Just don&#39;t try playing them at 3.5K.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdbfbd1-1c97-11ec-8f77-5de58b0380df" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="831c69dd-3e18-313e-8729-8e70fb31134b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The XPS 15 also scored around 50 percent higher in the PCMark 10 benchmark, something I&#39;d attribute both to that Intel CPU and the NVIDIA hardware. You can expect it to tackle most intense workloads with ease. It managed to transcode a one-minute 4K video file into 1080p in 35 seconds using Handbrake and the NVIDIA encoder.</p><p>As for the XPS 15&#39;s keyboard and trackpad, they&#39;re unchanged from last year. I appreciated the keyboard&#39;s wide layout and responsive keys, though I hope Dell explores ways to add even more depth. It&#39;d be nice for some of that CherryMX technology from Alienware&#39;s gaming laptops to make its way to the XPS line. The trackpad, meanwhile, is luxuriously smooth. No complaints there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdb86a0-1c97-11ec-9ffd-2c4315902940" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="cde0b525-a1cb-3840-9df1-fe1e39854e8c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I&#39;d like to see more than three USB-C ports, but at least two of them support Thunderbolt 4. And I&#39;ll always give a laptop extra credit for including a full-sized SD card slot. That&#39;s something photographers everywhere will appreciate. I was also surprised to find that the OLED screen didn&#39;t ding the XPS’s battery life as much as I thought it would. It lasted for nine hours and 55 minutes in our battery benchmark, compared to 10 hours and 10 minutes on last year&#39;s model with a 4K+ LCD.</p><p>The only downside of the XPS 15 is that Dell was a bit slow to add OLED. Remember, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-dell-4k-oled-xps-alienware.html">said OLED would be coming to the XPS 15 </a>since CES 2019. I was surprised that Dell didn&#39;t include it in the XPS 15&#39;s redesign last year and I wager the pandemic slowed things down a bit. But other PC makers, like ASUS, were much quicker to build OLED laptops, so it’s hard to make excuses for Dell.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdac350-1c97-11ec-bf9f-34ba25a76d38" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="87db685e-91cf-3999-9381-48e7daef1489"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:new XPS 15" href="https://bit.ly/3lOELBj">new XPS 15</a> starts at $1,300 with a Core i5 processor, integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You&#39;d have to shell out $2,000 to nab our review unit with a 512GB SSD. Those are reasonable prices for 15-inch workhorse machines, especially when the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a rather painful $2,400 and still has an aging ninth-gen Intel chip.</p><p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t expect Dell to do much with the XPS 15 after last year. But the addition of OLED goes a long way. It&#39;s one of the best screens you can find on a laptop today.

The law would also “unbundle” the sale of chargers from devices as a way of reducing e-waste.</p><p>EU officials are also proposing for technology manufacturers to harmonize their fast charging technology to ensure continuity between devices. Officials added that such harmonization would prevent “different producers unjustifiably [limiting] the charging speed” which isn&#39;t really the issue here.</p><p>Naturally, the obvious target for this is Apple, which has already come out against the proposal.

Currently, shooting in that format requires a large, relatively expensive drone and in many cases, a separate camera like DJI&#39;s <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186060-REG/dji_x5l_camera_and_3_axis.html">Zenmuse</a> line or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html">Panasonic&#39;s BGH1</a>. At the same time, a second telephoto camera would make it more versatile.</p><p>It will also offer direct USB-C charging so you don&#39;t need to remove the battery. All of that will boost the weight a bit, up from 907g on the Mavic 2 Pro to 920g for the Mavic 3 Pro. Despite that bump from the extra camera and other new features, the Mavic 3 will be able to fly for 46 minutes, way up from the 31 minutes available on the Mavic 2.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mavic 3 will apparently come in two flavors, a Pro and a Cine model, with the latter offering a built-in SSD and a &quot;1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable&quot; option for faster transfers. It will also offer a new version of DJI&#39;s display-equipped Smart Controller allowing for video transmission over 15km, up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mavic 3 Pro will cost $1,600, both sources say, which is the same price as the current Mavic 2 Pro. Prices for the Cine model are less clear, but could run around $1,000 more — still a relative deal for such a high tech camera drone. Both are expected to arrive on November 15th.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-may-have-a-bigger-sensor-and-46-minute-flight-time-090542963.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e5297f-ae7f-48a1-903f-ff2d4c622803</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 09:05:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632472702</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T08:38:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91810b60-1d08-11ec-bfda-e10652868cbb" width="4032" height="2739" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91810b60-1d08-11ec-bfda-e10652868cbb" width="4032" height="2739" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alwyn Scott / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of Chinese drone maker DJI is seen at the company's office in New York, New York, U.S., August 11, 2017.

The move makes the city one of the first municipalities in the US to aggressively regulate an industry that has grown by leaps and bounds during the pandemic.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/nyc-poised-to-improve-food-delivery-driver-working-conditions">Per <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the legislation touches nearly every aspect of the job. For instance, addressing an issue that was a subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html"><ins>$2.5 million settlement</ins></a>, delivery apps and courier services must disclose their gratuity policies, and guarantee that workers always receive their tips. They must also pay them at least once a week, and provide them with payment options that don’t necessitate the need for a bank account. Another part of the legislation mandates platforms include a clause in their contracts with restaurants to ensure they provide bathroom access to delivery workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both Grubhub and DoorDash told Engadget they support the legislation, though the latter voiced some reservations about specific measures. “We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them,” a DoorDash spokesperson said. “We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences.”</p><p>The company specifically pointed to the restroom mandate, which lawmakers tweaked near the end of the process to put the onus of ensuring compliance on platform holders. It’s also concerned about a provision that gives delivery workers the ability to set limits on their routes. The company contends that’s something that could hurt customers in underserved areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grubhub voiced, at least publicly, stronger support for the laws. “These bills are common-sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents,” a spokesperson for the company told Engadget. “Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea — it’s the right thing to do.”</p><p>Just how difficult it can be to make a living as a delivery worker was put in sharp relief last month when Hurricane Ida blanketed New York City with torrential rain. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/nyregion/ida-delivery-workers-safety.html"><ins>Images and videos</ins></a> of workers navigating flooded streets spread on social media, leading to calls for more regulation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-food-delivery-workers-laws-234217000.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4438151-4218-41eb-9bed-50ceec2690f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 23:42:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632440543</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T23:42:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlo Allegri / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A delivery person for Doordash rides his bike in the rain during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 13, 2020.
