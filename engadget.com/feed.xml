Though Engadget intended to send a few editors to cover CES in person, we later decided amid surging covid cases that it would be best if our entire staff just stayed home and covered the show remotely. In the end, too, we also decided it would be easiest, under these very fluid circumstances, to do our own thing for our annual CES Awards, which since 2014 we have produced in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES itself. Though we can’t hand out awards in person this year, we do still have opinions. And we&#39;re about to share them with you.</p><p>What follows are all of our favorites from CES 2022 which, despite some stormy press, turned out to be a surprisingly busy show (if <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/05/ces-2022-las-vegas-covid/">not in foot traffic</a>, then certainly in hard news). As in years past, we arrived at these picks by first asking the editors who cover these categories year-round to weigh in on a shortlist. Then our wider team voted using a ranked-choice system. Maybe one day we&#39;ll also tell you about the dark-horse favorites that almost, but didn&#39;t quite, make the cut. — <em>Dana Wollman, Editor-in-Chief</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Best Accessibility Product</h2><h3>OrCam MyEye Pro</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70b57b00-6fdd-11ec-b6fd-aef18ea25eb4" alt="OrCam MyEye Pro" data-uuid="3d4e14a9-581c-3cc1-b31a-c5643a0883af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OrCam</div></figure><p>For people with low vision or difficulty reading, camera-based gadgets with object recognition can make life a little easier. OrCam’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/orcam-smart-glasses-visually-impaired-ces-2022-innovation-award-083054174.html">MyEye Pro</a> is a wearable camera module that can be attached to any pair of glasses. Like previous generations, the MyEye Pro can read text, identify objects and faces and tell the wearer what it sees via an onboard speaker or paired Bluetooth headphones. In addition to a touch-sensitive control panel, OrCam offers voice control via the company’s own assistant with the “Hey OrCam” hotword. The Pro also features a faster processor than older models, an additional microphone, stronger magnets and improved tactile cues. It has a new interactive “Smart Reading” feature that lets users ask their MyEye to quickly find specific information like phone numbers, the total on a bill, a particular word on a page and more.</p><p>MyEye Pro is one of a few assistive devices built specifically to help people with vision impairments or reading disabilities. Though smartphones can arguably perform similar tasks, the fact that the OrCam can be mounted on spectacles makes it easier for extended reading or all-day use. The company needs to address some usability issues, and like most assistive devices the MyEye is very expensive starting at <a href="https://amzn.to/3EYsjXa">$3,990</a>. But with greater awareness of the existence of such products, perhaps more insurance providers will consider covering some of the cost. — <em>Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor / Reviews</em></p><h2><strong>Best Health and Fitness Product</strong></h2><h3><strong>Withings Body Scan</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70baf941-6fdd-11ec-be7b-871e26d3b033" alt="Withings Body Scan" data-uuid="07ed2a42-dc79-34a6-becb-41c4c14c0e9f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Withings has been doing all it can to push the boundaries of what a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-02-withings-body-cardio-scale-review.html">bathroom weighing scale</a> can do for a long while now. This year at CES, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-latest-scale-has-a-handheld-lead-to-measure-fat-in-different-body-parts-010059582.html">Withings Body Scan</a>, which aims to bring a number of new health-monitoring technologies into your home. The Body Scan’s most obvious new feature is the pull-out handlebar that you’ll hold in front of your waist while you’re standing on the deck. This allows the device to run an ECG to check on your heart health, offer up sequential body composition data and, most intriguing, analyze your nerve activity.</p><p>It’s not just the breadth of data the <a href="https://fave.co/3FZgmSj">Body Scan</a> promises to analyze, but the claimed depth that impressed us. Withings says that its six-lead ECG will produce medical-grade results and that its output can easily be read by a cardiologist. Meanwhile, the nerve activity tracking will look for signs of nerve degeneration, which can be caused by obesity (and treated with appropriate remedial action). It’s a hell of a lot of tech to pack into one consumer device, and if Withings makes good on its promises, it may become the bathroom scale of choice for anyone who wants to keep tabs on their health. — <em>Daniel Cooper, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Wearable</strong></h2><h3>Razer Zephyr Pro</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70baf941-6fdd-11ec-9bbf-a79446668d61" alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" data-uuid="b35c87d7-e9fa-35c6-9113-0feae35c330b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>In a year where many CES attendees decided to stay home amid rising COVID cases, it feels fitting that our favorite wearable at the show was a smart mask. Tech companies had already started to put their spin on face coverings, with Razer’s original <a href="https://fave.co/3zxPzKl">$100 Zephyr mask</a> and LG’s PuriCare Mask. With a gamer steampunk-inspired design, the first–gen Zephyr combined N95 filters, dual-fan active air filtration system and (of course) RGB lighting all in one striking device.</p><p>Razer followed up this year with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-zephyr-pro-announcement-180037042.html">Zephyr Pro</a> and one new feature in particular is worth highlighting: the ability to amplify your voice by 60 decibels up to one meter away. It solves a problem most of us have experienced at some point over the past couple of years: You try to order a coffee and the barista behind the counter can&#39;t hear you over your mask, not to mention the protective plastic wall separating you both. In theory, if you&#39;re wearing the Zephyr Pro, you shouldn&#39;t have this problem. Whenever you don&#39;t want to use the feature (or maybe just want to conserve battery), you can turn off voice amplification.</p><p>We don&#39;t know exactly when the Zephyr Pro will come out, but Razer has said it will cost <a href="https://fave.co/3F2a5nH">$150</a>, or $200 for the starter pack with 100 days worth of filters. Is the Zephyr Pro a bit excessive? Yes. Will the RGB lighting make you look ridiculous? You bet. But even so, we have to hand it to Razer for making masked interactions just a little easier. — <em>Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Transportation Tech</strong></h2><h3>Chevrolet Silverado EV</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bad230-6fdd-11ec-a7fc-1bbf5ab8eef4" alt="Chevrolet Silverado EV" data-uuid="22eadc9c-aa91-3e5d-93df-e7b977cf09e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chevrolet</div></figure><p>2022 is already shaping up to be the year of the electric pickup, so it was no surprise that GM CEO Mary Barra took to the CES stage on Wednesday to officially unveil the American automaker’s second electrified truck, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet Silverado EV</a>. We shouldn’t need to explain why Chevy’s best-selling vehicle going electric is a big deal.</p><p>The new Silverado joins the Hummer EV in GM’s burgeoning electric truck lineup (soon to be accompanied by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-blazer-equinox-ev-teaser-184112130.html">Blazer and Equinox</a> EVs) and will arrive in two versions: the RST First Edition, a limited-run production with an MSRP just north of $100,000, followed by the far more affordable WT fleet edition and standard RST – both of which start at around $39,900.</p><p>Positioned to compete directly with Ford’s forthcoming F-150 Lightning, the Silverado EV RST will offer a GM-estimated 400 mile range, up to 664 horsepower and 811 ft-lb of torque with the ability to tow up to 10,000 pounds. The WT version will be slightly less powerful but still boasts 510 hp, 615 lb-ft of torque and 8,000 pounds of towing capacity. Both the RST and WT versions will enter production alongside the Hummer EV line at GM’s new Factory ZERO electric vehicle production facility in 2023. — <em>Andrew Tarantola, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Home Theater Product</strong></h2><h3>Samsung Eco Remote (2022)</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70baf940-6fdd-11ec-bcbb-6bbcc3fedaec" alt="Samsung Eco Remote" data-uuid="3d518764-2cde-3324-baea-f0ee380da9f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>At CES last year, <a href="https://fave.co/31Ygak3">Samsung</a> debuted an Eco Remote that uses indoor or outdoor light to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-solar-cell-remote-control-ces-2021-201053496.html">recharge via a solar panel</a>. This year, the company took things a step further. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-eco-remote-2022-radio-waves-router-020027276.html">The 2022 model</a> brings back the solar panel and adds the ability to recharge using radio frequency (RF) signals from your WiFi router. Since you don’t need to replace the battery, this eliminates the need to hunt for AAAs (which would eventually be destined for a landfill).</p><p>Using energy that otherwise goes to waste, the new Eco Remote’s low power requirements make it a good choice for harvesting RF waves. The device, available with either a black or white finish, is also equipped with dedicated buttons for streaming services to give you one-touch access. Sure, you’ll need a Samsung TV to use it, but the greener power sources certainly help the device live up to its name. And hopefully, Samsung’s clever use of RF waves can serve as inspiration for other TV manufacturers. — <em>Billy Steele, Senior News Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Smart Home Product</strong></h2><h3>TP-Link Archer AXE200 Omni</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2051-6fdd-11ec-b7bf-36493f8256b5" alt="TP-Link Archer AXE200 Omni" data-uuid="f33c1afa-9cef-382c-ab49-56db45f806ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TP-Link</div></figure><p>It wouldn’t be CES if we didn’t see some crazy routers, and TP-Link delivered this year. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-router-antennas-automatically-move-wifi-6e-151032290.html">TP-Link AXE200 Omni router</a> has the over-the-top design that the company typically saves for its most expensive and powerful devices, but this model has a trick we’ve never seen before. It packs four mechanical antennas that can rotate automatically based on the placement and location of devices using your WiFi connection.</p><p>Sure, this feature looks cool in action (almost anthropomorphic, even), but TP-Link’s history-making top-flight routers means this likely isn’t a gimmick. And the rest of its specs are top of the line, too. It has tri-band WiFi 6E, capable of delivering speeds of up to 11 Gbps. There are also 10 Gigabit ethernet ports for wired connections. Given how many devices most households have these days, having a powerful, reliable router is crucial to keeping everything online. TP-Link’s latest should be able to do that no matter how many gadgets you need to connect. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor / News</em></p><h2><strong>Best Phone or Tablet</strong></h2><h3>Asus ZenBook 17 Fold</h3><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2054-6fdd-11ec-bf39-7232c88aa2ee" alt="Asus ZenBook 17 Fold" data-uuid="f14a0406-b91e-3088-9cbe-b0d11c3e7a82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Asus</div></figure><p>There was no shortage of mobile devices at CES this year, ranging from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-10-pro-reveal-launch-date-specs-price-010013479.html">OnePlus’ new flagship</a> to Samsung’s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-specs-price-availability-hands-on-020006151.html">value-for-money phone</a>. If the award should go to the most memorable, though, there was one clear pick. We’ve chosen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-tablet-foldable-164510240.html">ASUS’ ZenBook 17 Fold</a> for attempting to redefine tablets, foldables and laptops in one fell swoop.</p><p>The foldable tablet category isn’t exactly novel, given past entries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-foldable-pc-review-specs-price-181519620.html">Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold</a>. <a href="https://fave.co/3f7kSCh">ASUS’ offering</a> is decidedly bolder, though, with a 17.3-inch OLED screen that offers a huge canvas and various usage possibilities (think: a book-like reader or a desktop PC). You’ll even have a usable laptop thanks to an included Bluetooth keyboard that allows the folded tablet to function as a 12.5-inch Windows laptop. All told, this is one of the most versatile tablets we’ve seen, and it could replace more than just your notebook depending on how you use it. — <em>Jon Fingas, Weekend Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best TV Tech</strong></h2><h3>Samsung QD-Display</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2050-6fdd-11ec-8f7f-55ff539c1012" alt="Samsung QD-Display" data-uuid="1e44110c-1c70-377b-afdb-e9c1cdadc2e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung Display</div></figure><p>We&#39;ve praised LG&#39;s OLED TVs for years, mainly because they represent a huge upgrade over LCDs in almost every way. Their one big weakness is brightness: LCDs rely on backlights that can reach far beyond a single OLED, which can&#39;t burn too hot or they risk failure. OLEDs also lose a bit of color accuracy the brighter they get. Now Samsung believes it has a solution: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html">QD-Display</a>, an updated OLED technology that relies on quantum dots to supercharge colors and deliver more brightness. On paper, it seems like the biggest advancement in TV technology we’ve seen in years.</p><p>While Samsung isn&#39;t showing off its own QD-Display TVs yet, Sony leapt at the chance to adopt the technology for its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html?src=rss">A95K premium TV</a>.

Sony revealed the name, logo and specs for its next virtual reality headset, PlayStation VR2, and even though the device didn’t make an appearance, the details were enough to get us excited about the upcoming headset.</p><p>The PS VR2 has a display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 for each eye, a 110-degree field of view, 4K HDR capabilities and frame rates of 90Hz or 120Hz. The new device has upgraded eye-tracking software and it also supports foveated rendering, a gaze-based feature common in high-end PC headsets. The addition of inside-out tracking means it doesn’t require an external camera – a nice step up from the original PS VR. The most surprising detail about the PS VR2 is the fact that it includes an internal motor that can make the headset vibrate, providing a new level of haptic feedback (or maybe just a headache).</p><p>In addition to all those details, Sony confirmed an original game in the Horizon universe is heading exclusively to the headset, and developer Guerrilla gave us a quick tease of first-person robot-dino hunting. Console gaming news at CES is a rarity, which makes Sony’s showing this year stand out, even without any actual hardware. — <em>Jessica Conditt, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Laptop</strong></h2><h3>Lenovo ThinkPad Z Series</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2052-6fdd-11ec-bf7b-2acdd0de3cd6" alt="Lenovo ThinkPad Z Series" data-uuid="77744746-350d-3dba-891a-21e9626b0a01"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>Come for the lid; stay for the sustainability. Or maybe it’s the other way around. When we first saw the <a href="https://bit.ly/32Y6h9Z">ThinkPad Z series</a> at a private demo ahead of CES, we were immediately charmed by its lid, which is designed to be openable with just one hand. But as we learned more about these sleek laptops, available with 13- and 16-inch screens, we were impressed with their focus on sustainability, including materials like recycled aluminum and vegan leather, and a charger made of 90 percent recyclable material. Even the packaging is 100 percent recyclable, thanks to compostable materials like bamboo and sugarcane.</p><p>We haven’t even talked about the potentially solid performance. The Z13 and Z16 are the result of a collaboration with AMD. In fact, these are among the first machines with AMD’s high-performance Ryzen PRO 6000 Series laptop processors. On the outside, the Z13 boasts a 2.8K OLED display while the 16 has a 4K screen, also OLED. Both machines support Dolby Vision, along with Dolby Atmos and Dolby AI noise cancellation.

Traditional tires are resource intensive to produce and difficult to dispose of, with only a small fraction of them ending up actually being recycled. As such, Goodyear two years ago set an ambitious goal for itself: develop a 100-percent sustainable tire by 2030. Two years into this project, the company is already well on its way toward meeting that goal.</p><p>Earlier this week, the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/goodyear-prototype-tire-70-percent-sustainable-materials-170024650.html">70-percent sustainable concept tire</a>, which features 13 ingredients across nine different tire components that were formerly made with petroleum and other non-renewable resources. For example, carbon black and other petrol-based rubbers are typically used as filler materials to enhance a tire’s durability and usable lifespan. Goodyear has substituted these with more eco-friendly methane, carbon dioxide and plant-based oil, all of which are produced in ways that generate fewer greenhouse gasses than carbon black. Additionally, Goodyear employs silica, which increases a tire’s grip on the road, that has been derived from rice husk ash, a common by-product of the rice milling process.</p><p>Whether Goodyear releases a tire utilizing all of its sustainable technologies by 2030, or simply works individual materials into upcoming models, the environment still stands to benefit. — <em>Andrew Tarantola, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Wildcard</strong></h2><h3>BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2053-6fdd-11ec-bf5d-774ff467dc74" alt="BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink" data-uuid="55a49538-051a-3199-8253-edad8ce765c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>When it comes to CES, there are so many left-field products on display that it can sometimes be hard to define a “wildcard.” Is it a futuristic concept, a bizarre novelty, or simply something you had no idea would be good until it was presented to you? This year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html">BMW’s iX Flow featuring E Ink</a> ticked the “well, we didn’t expect <em>that</em>” box the hardest, and it’s certainly a striking concept. Essentially, BMW coated the skin of its iX car with the same electrophoretic coating you’ll find in most e-readers. The pitch being that, at the touch of a button, you can change the color of your vehicle to reflect your current mood. You know, as one does.</p><p>Of course, while the BMW iX itself is a road-ready car, the E Ink coating isn’t something you can expect to buy in the near future. But even being able to switch from black to white makes plenty of sense in these more energy-conscious times. In warm weather, you can paint the car white and help reflect some of the sun’s heat, reducing the drain on your AC. And when it gets cold, you can reverse the process, helping to store up more warmth to keep you, and your battery, nice and cozy. Even better, if the company gets a color E Ink version working, then we never need to worry about being stuck with someone else’s idea of a good paint job. — <em>Daniel Cooper, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best of the Best</strong></h2><h3>Chevrolet Silverado EV</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70b57b01-6fdd-11ec-bfea-1b4563453bcd" alt="Chevrolet Silverado EV" data-uuid="fffe881d-86d5-39a4-a5df-ad90b7331341"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chevrolet</div></figure><p>CES 2022 brought us a bevy of innovative announcements from the automotive industry, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html">chameleon-skinned BMWs</a> to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-solar-powered-long-range-ev-concept-183758507.html">sun-soaked 600-mile electric Mercedes</a>. But as ranked-choice systems are wont to do, there can be only one overall winner. This year, the king of the CES hill is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet’s Silverado EV</a>, an electrified pickup that is sure to give both global warming and rival EV, the Ford F-150 Lightning, a run for their money.</p><p>The Silverado is already one of America’s most popular pickup models, having sold more than half a million US units in 2021 alone. Pickups and SUVs in general are far and away the best selling vehicle types in the US but those same buyers have historically been reticent to adopt more eco-friendly alternatives to conventional internal combustion cars and trucks — heck, just a few years ago many diesel owners were giddily “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal">rolling coal</a>” for the social media clout. But as fuel prices and sea surface temperatures continue to rise, the prospect of driving up to 400 miles (or more!) using nothing but a battery has become a compelling feature for drivers and automakers alike.</p><p>GM has already pledged to sell “<a href="https://www.gm.com/electric-vehicles">30 new global electric vehicles by 2025</a>” starting with the Hummer EV, which is already being delivered to early buyers. The Chevy Silverado, Blazer, Equinox and GMC Sierra all poised for production runs of their own starting in 2023. And once these EVs roll off their respective assembly lines, they’ll be faced with stiff competition from Ford, Tesla, Rivian, Toyota and other car makers eager to cash in on America’s newfound love affair with electrified pickups. — <em>Andrew Tarantola, Senior Editor</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-of-ces-2022-200032353.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02244675-cc27-4358-9c45-52428c32edb8</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 20:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641584773</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T19:46:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82e3c660-6f38-11ec-a269-37e42d3c7212" width="1657" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82e15560-6f38-11ec-a9eb-c48026dd2e68" width="1807" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AP Photo/Joe Buglewicz / Engadget (Illustration)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Engadget Best of CES 2022]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Engadget Best of CES 2022]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IKEA and Sonos refresh the Symfonisk bookshelf speaker with a faster processer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Without much fanfare, IKEA and Sonos have released a second-generation version of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">Symfonisk bookshelf</a> speaker.

Since the start of the year, the automaker’s forums have been flooded with reports of people complaining that the clocks and calendars in their vehicles are stuck in the year 2002.</p><p>The issue appears to be widespread. It’s affecting <a href="https://www.ridgelineownersclub.com/threads/time-date-issues-beginning-january-1-2022-latest-update-in-first-post.230330/">Honda</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura/comments/rv4cj1/digital_clock_issue/">Acura</a> models with GPS navigation systems manufactured between 2004 and 2012, and there have been reports of people encountering the problem in the US, Canada and UK. What’s more, there doesn’t appear to a fix at the moment. Each time someone starts their car, the clock resets – even if they went to manually set it beforehand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems,” a spokesperson for the automaker told <a href="https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970"><em><ins>Jalopnik</ins></em></a>. “We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.”</p><p>The problem appears to stem from a coding oversight. When a GPS satellite broadcasts the date, it does so using a binary 10 digit number that includes a reference to the week. A single GPS epoch includes 1023 weeks, with the system rolling over on week 1,024. After the first GPS systems started counting time in 1980, they rolled over in 1999, and then again in 2019. If a system isn’t properly coded to account for those rollovers, what can happen is exactly what we’re seeing here with Honda’s vehicles: they go back to when the calendar started.</p><p>Humorously, this isn’t the first time Honda car owners have run into this problem. Back in <a href="https://jalopnik.com/hondas-and-acuras-from-1999-2004-had-their-clocks-fail-1798427017"><ins>2017</ins></a>, Honda and Acura models from 1999 to 2004 with navigation systems had their clocks reset to 1998. The same issue cropped up more recently in <a href="https://acurazine.com/forums/3g-tl-audio-bluetooth-electronics-navigation-94/navigation-system-doesnt-know-day-wont-allow-clock-adjustment-991736/"><ins>2021</ins></a>. In both instances, the clocks went back exactly 1,024 weeks. Time knows how to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-exchange-year-2022-bug-fix-215225070.html">mockery of everyone</a>, but it would seem it has a special place for Honda’s software developers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-2002-gps-bug-190248626.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b82d7946-cc72-4611-823f-90ea65608427</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 19:02:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641580739</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T18:39:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c823f150-6fe7-11ec-bf5f-f1557b16d8c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c823f150-6fe7-11ec-bf5f-f1557b16d8c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Callopy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neon, Valorant's newest agent, brings sprinting and sliding to the game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-mobile-annoucement-130018738.html"><em>Valorant</em></a> is a game of methodical movement. Your weapon is at its most accurate when you’re standing still, and pinpoint accuracy is essential if you want to live. That’s what makes Neon, the game’s latest playable character, so interesting. She’s a hyper-aggressive duelist whose kit is all about increasing the tempo of matches.</p><div id="815d81e4bcfe4a509408d790dad90849"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtx8CgjRmqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Following a teaser trailer released earlier in the week, Riot has detailed all of Neon’s abilities. Her innate skill “High Gear” allows Neon to sprint and slide into combat, something no <em>Valorant</em> agent before her has been able to do. “Speed, everything about Neon came back to that feeling of running forward and moving fast,” said character producer John Goscicki.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neon’s two other primary abilities, “Relay Bolt” and “Fast Lane,” allow her to throw an electric molly and create two parallel walls of vision-obscuring static. Meanwhile, her ultimate, “Overdrive,” lets Neon shoot out deadly lighting beams, with each kill she obtains resetting the duration of the skill. Her kit is most reminiscent of that of Phoenix who can create a wall of flame to cover his entry assaults. However, the fact Neon can sprint and slide should make weapons like the Stinger, Judge and Frenzy especially deadly in her hands since they tend to dominate in close quarters.</p><p>Neon will join <em>Valorant’s</em> roster on January 11th, the same day Riot plans to release Episode Four, Act One. You can get the associated Battlepass for 1,000 Valorant Points, or the equivalent of $10.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valorant-neon-character-details-180007734.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9128ff36-208a-4d23-81de-830cf8ac71fc</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 18:00:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641505421</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T21:43:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3d519ae0-6f39-11ec-bbf4-cadce204d342" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3d519ae0-6f39-11ec-bbf4-cadce204d342" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Neon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Neon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Model Brooks Nader says someone used an AirTag to track her]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/airtags/"><ins>AirTags</ins></a> can be useful for helping find lost belongings, ever since the tracker went on sale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html"><ins>last spring</ins></a>, critics have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"><ins>raised concerns</ins></a> that bad actors could use it to stalk people. Brooks Nader, a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit model, <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/brooks-nader-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-model-says-apple-airtag-used-to-track-her-in-nyc">claims</a> someone secretly placed an AirTag in her coat and tracked her movements for several hours.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nader was waiting alone for someone at a crowded bar in Tribeca with her coat on the chair behind her. She then visited a couple of other bars with friends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nader, who shared her experience on Instagram Stories, said that while she was walking home alone, her phone alerted her to the fact that &quot;someone&#39;s tracking you and has been for a while.&quot; She then found the AirTag. Nader, who wasn&#39;t aware of AirTags beforehand, called the incident &quot;the scariest moment ever and I just want everyone to be aware that this exists.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not the first time that AirTags have been used to track other people&#39;s movements. Reports have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/airtag-car-thefts-story/"><ins>emerged</ins></a> about thieves using them to follow and steal high-end cars. However, the Nader incident is a high-profile one that should draw more attention to the issue.</p><p>&quot;We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag’s privacy and security. AirTag is designed with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — that both inform users if an unknown AirTag might be with them, and deter bad actors from using an AirTag for nefarious purposes,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;If users ever feel their safety is at risk, they are encouraged to contact local law enforcement who can work with Apple to provide any available information about the unknown AirTag.”</p><p>Soon after Apple launched the AirTag, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-privacy-update-193102233.html">rolled out</a> the iPhone notification Nader mentioned to inform users that someone may be tracking them. In December, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-detect-tracker-android-release-193850566.html">released an Android app</a> called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect">Tracker Detect</a>, which alerts users to nearby AirTags that are away from their owner and could be on their person. However, since Find My isn&#39;t part of Android, you&#39;d need to know about the app and have it installed to detect a hidden AirTag.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-brooks-nader-tracked-privacy-175938300.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1b18510c-68b2-47fb-8236-d2353266d04c</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:59:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641578379</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T17:59:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GameStop is reportedly developing a marketplace for NFTs of in-game items]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following Ubisoft and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-blockchain-games-173640368.html">Square Enix</a>, GameStop is apparently the latest player in the video game industry that sees NFTs as a way to boost its profitability.  According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-entering-nft-and-cryptocurrency-markets-as-part-of-turnaround-plan-11641504417?mod=latest_headlines"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the company has hired nearly two dozen people as part of a newly formed cryptocurrency division. The unit is reportedly building an online marketplace for buying, selling and trading NFTs of in-game items like cosmetics. The hub could launch as soon as later this year. Additionally, the division is reportedly close to partnering with two companies to co-invest in games that make use of blockchain and NFT technologies. GameStop is said ot plan to partner with a dozen companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>News of the development sent the value of GameStop’s <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-stock-soar-over-30-after-hours-thursday-and-reddit-crowd-cheers-after-report-of-plans-for-nft-platform-11641509212"><ins>stock surging to $159.77</ins></a>, up from $131.01, in aftermarket trading. According to <em>The Journal</em>, GameStop executives see NFTs as a way for the company to return to profitability, but it’s not clear if the nascent technology has a place in video games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the recent attempts by some developers and publishers to include digital tokens in their titles have been greeted by outright hostility. Ubisoft, for example, became a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"><ins>magnet for criticism</ins></a> when it announced its Quartz NFT platform. It also seems the negative attention was not worth it for Ubisoft, with a recent <em>Eurogamer</em> report claiming the company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html"><ins>only sold 18 NFTs</ins></a> as of December 21st. But for all the backlash, Ubisoft and others appear unfazed. In an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-boss-tells-employees-that-nfts-are-just-the-beg-1848236987"><ins>employee Q&amp;A</ins></a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reportedly linked the initial backlash to NFTs to earlier outrage over trends like microtransactions and loot boxes. It seems the implication here was that people would eventually come to accept the technology.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-nft-marketplace-report-171819124.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43b1aa2d-6661-42be-857c-a8ecf0d70c68</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:18:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641575900</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T17:18:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b33b29d0-6fdc-11ec-bfba-7ef46ce7568c" width="7431" height="4956" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b33b29d0-6fdc-11ec-bfba-7ef46ce7568c" width="7431" height="4956" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Kelly / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person browses games at an XBox One Display in a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021.

While we likely won&#39;t see the deep discounts we saw in November and December for some time, the deals that are currently available are noteworthy for this time of year. A number of Google smart devices are on sale, including the second-generation Nest Hub for $60 and the Nest Audio for $75. Apple&#39;s Mac Mini M1 is as low as $600 for the base model, while the iPad Air is $60 off.

That&#39;s a spin on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-time-to-walk-audio-stories-fitness-plus-142555084.html"><ins>Time to Walk</ins></a> experience, in which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-time-to-walk-prince-william-151055655.html"><ins>celebrity guests</ins></a> provide narration and a playlist to accompany walks.</p><p>The aim of Time to Run is to help folks &quot;become more consistent and better runners.&quot; It taps into some popular running routes from various cities, and features playlists designed to evoke the spirit of those locations and match the intensity and coaching of each run. The first three episodes that drop on Monday are based on London, Brooklyn and Miami Beach. A new episode will debut each week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rather than celebrity guests, familiar Fitness+ trainers will lead Time to Run sessions. On your Apple Watch, you&#39;ll be able to see photos taken by the trainer along their route. You can view these images in the workout summary and save them to your photo library. For those who use a wheelchair, the feature will be renamed Time to Run or Push, and they&#39;ll be able to select either a run or an Outdoor Push Running Pace workout.</p><p>Apple told Engadget that Time to Run episodes each last around 30 or 60 minutes, which is longer than the typical Time to Walk runtime of 25 to 40 minutes. Other fitness apps offer audio-guided running features, such as Aaptiv, Nike+Run Club and Runtastic. Apple isn&#39;t exactly breaking new ground here, but Fitness+ users will have another option for working up a sweat.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8538d9b0-6fd7-11ec-ad77-f04a0af04d76" style="height:1400;width:1960;" alt="Apple Fitness+ Collections displayed on an iPad." data-uuid="d35f57d0-9d7d-37a0-87f2-21f257e154ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Also on January 10th, Apple will roll out Collections. It&#39;s a curated series of workouts and guided meditations pulled from the Fitness+ library. The feature will suggest plans to help folks make intentional training choices in the following days and weeks. Six Collections will be available at the outset, including Run Your First 5K, Perfect Your Yoga Balance Poses and Wind Down for a Better Bedtime.</p><p>On the same day, the third season of Time to Walk will premiere. The latest batch of guests include Rebel Wilson, Bernice A. King, Chris Meloni and Hasan Minhaj. Episodes will be added on a weekly basis.

It’s the maker of the highly sought-after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-19-at-home-rapid-serial-testing-074232925.html">BinaxNOW rapid COVID-19 tests</a>. It’s also behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-28-fda-freestyle-libre-flash.html"><ins>Freestyle Livre</ins></a>, one of the more popular continuous glucose monitors that negates the need for finger stick blood testing.</p><p>The upcoming biowearables, which aren&#39;t intended for medical use, build on the sensing tech Abbott developed for Freestyle Livre. Athletes are using a version of the device to help optimize their food intake for their training and competition. With Lingo, the company is planning to expand glucose monitoring use cases to help the public manage things like sleep, weight and energy levels.</p><p>The aim of the ketone biowearable is to offer continuous tracking of ketones so that wearers can see how quickly they get into ketosis. That&#39;s a state in which a body doesn&#39;t have enough carbohydrates to turn into energy and instead burns fat (and generates ketones). With the lactate wearable, Abbott&#39;s goal is to continuously measure lactate build up while working out. It says that can provide insights on athletic performance.</p><p>It&#39;ll be some time before Abbott can bring this tech to the consumer market. If and when the biowearables do arrive and they work as promised, they should help those interested in keeping close tabs on the condition of their body to do so.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/abbott-biowearables-glucose-lactate-ketones-153056160.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96615143-0585-44b7-878f-5951f429cccb</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 15:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641569457</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T15:31:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a810fd60-6fcc-11ec-baeb-2d574fb75371" width="4813" height="3209" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a810fd60-6fcc-11ec-baeb-2d574fb75371" width="4813" height="3209" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PATRICK T.

While he&#39;s no longer with us, his contribution to our understanding of the universe remains immense and shouldn&#39;t be forgotten. To pay tribute to the celebrated physicist and cosmologist on what would&#39;ve been his 80th birthday, Google worked with his family to create a video Doodle that gives us a condensed version of his life. Moreover, the tech giant used Hawking&#39;s famous computer-generated voice to narrate his work and experiences from the time he graduated.&nbsp;</p><p>Hawking was born in 1942 in Oxford, England and has always been fascinated with the universe. He was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease, when he was 21. In the years after that, he lost his mobility and his ability to speak, but he was able to communicate through a computer using a voice created in the 1980s by MIT engineer Dennis Klatt. In the Doodle, you&#39;ll hear Hawking&#39;s voice talk about his work on black holes — one of the scientific works he&#39;s most known for is the Hawking radiation, which is the theory that black holes emit radiation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll also hear his voice say how he&#39;s free in his mind even though he cannot move. &quot;I have spent my life traveling across the universe inside my mind,&quot; his voice narrates.</p><p>In a statement, his daughter Lucy and sons, Robert and Tim Hawking, said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We also believe he would have found it important to show that he never allowed the challenges of his physical condition to limit his power of expression nor his determination to make an impact on the world in which he lived. We hope that his example offers inspiration and hope globally to all who face great challenges at this difficult time. Our father would have been 80 years old today and we thank everyone who has joined in the celebration of his extraordinary life and the legacy he gave to us all.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>You can watch the whole Doodle below.</p><div id="689c3833f8b540bea6673eb51462f31e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Isim0ysZ6X4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-doodle-pays-tribute-stephen-hawking-134549358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a409cc0b-68ea-4dab-bc0b-f9697ce9774a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 13:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641561654</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T13:21:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2681b40-6fb5-11ec-ab6f-2dc3199a4641" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2681b40-6fb5-11ec-ab6f-2dc3199a4641" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Everything we loved (and hated) at CES 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s that time of the year again!

The company is holding back from revealing absolutely everything (well, most things), but that hasn&#39;t stopped <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-10-pro-leak-reveals-all-of-the-phones-key-specs">leaks and rumors </a>of a 6.7-inch display with high refresh rates, and the very latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It followed up Tuesday evening with a barrage of specs. They include a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED with LTPO screen, which means the phone can adjust its refresh rates to improve battery life. There are no specifics on screen size, but the rumors suggest it’ll be a pretty large 6.7-inch display. OnePlus will include 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging in its new flagship, which should be suitably speedy when the 5,000mAh battery needs charging.<br><br>The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, running Android 12 with OnePlus’ OxygenOS tricks and aesthetics. When it comes to cameras, expect 48- and 50-megapixel sensors with an additional 8MP sensor too. Optical zoom capabilities? We don’t know just yet, but the camera array will include dual optical image stabilization, which should help with crisper images, less noise and better performance in low light. That said, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera performance was one of the weaker points on an otherwise impressive smartphone. <br><br>Hopefully, the 10 Pro can right that wrong. OnePlus has outlined some of the upgrades it’s making to the Hasselblad-branded camera, including a new RAW+ shooting mode that attempts to combine the editing range of RAW format images with computational photography, which should result in increased dynamic range and noise reduction.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58a43a40-6f99-11ec-9fa7-5bd1c621cd45" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="f0e70253-539b-3d7d-b242-77167c16b624"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>The phone also has a new 150-degree ultra-wide camera, with a new fisheye mode. If you’re fearing stretched faces in group shots, don’t worry: there’s a “more traditional” 110-degree FOV that’ll include distortion correction for those outer edges of a shot.&nbsp;</p><p>OnePlus says its new “Billion Color Solution” means photos on the 10 Pro have 25 percent expanded DCI-P3 color gamut covered, and the phone can process 64 times more color than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It says this will remove any hint of color banding from shots.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588392e0-6f99-11ec-bffd-ce4c25d94bf3" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="24d9b170-79a7-3ee5-beb1-bbf3b7fbc02f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>On top of that, each camera on the OnePlus 10 Pro can capture photos in 12-bit RAW, using what Hasselblad calls Natural Color Solution.  The phone also has a new RAW+ format that should allow you to edit to your heart’s content while still benefiting from computational photography assistance. OnePlus has offered a few samples, but it’s something we’ll have a better grasp of when we eventually get to test out the new flagship later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The big challenge could be balancing price, specs and features so that it offers enough go up against the high-end phones of Apple and Samsung.

Adding functionality to existing products and software is an important part of that, but purpose-built devices play a role as well. &quot;Both OrCam MyEye and OrCam Read have been instrumental devices in ensuring our users have been able to continue their academic, professional and personal pursuits and remain connected to family, friends and society at large,&quot; Shashua said.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/orcam-smart-glasses-visually-impaired-ces-2022-innovation-award-083054174.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48f5d156-4403-4e4b-81fd-aaa09992f2b2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 08:30:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641562164</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T13:29:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fec0d180-6f7c-11ec-9f2f-95e15c2fb7f3" width="2000" height="883" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fec0d180-6f7c-11ec-9f2f-95e15c2fb7f3" width="2000" height="883" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[OrCam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Orcam's MyEye Pro assistant for the visually impaired wins a CES 2022 Innovation Award]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OrCam's MyEye Pro assistant for the visually impaired wins a CES 2022 Innovation Award]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US regulator rules that Google infringed on Sonos speaker patents]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US International Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1191_notice01062022sgl.pdf">agreed</a> with Sonos&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html">claims</a> that Google had infringed on its speaker and cast patents. It issued its initial decision back in August, and this finalizes its ruling, which prohibits Google from importing products found to have violated Sonos&#39; intellectual properties. Since Google manufactures its products in China, that means it won&#39;t be able to gets them shipped to the US when the import ban takes effect in 60 days.</p><p>Sonos sued Google in 2020 over five patents, which include one that details a technology allowing wireless speakers to sync with one another.

They&#39;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p><p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#39;s a possibility that &quot;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&quot; However, he said the tech giant&#39;s products will still &quot;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&quot; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>His whole statement reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#39; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-regulator-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents-062437906.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee6604f1-b339-44b6-a410-8065f42e68c1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 06:24:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641536678</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T06:24:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta sued for alleged role in extremist-linked murder of federal guard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The surviving sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal security guard who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2020, has filed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21174499-underwood-v-meta-complaint">a lawsuit</a> against Meta, the parent organization of Facebook.

The company is testing a new “Tweet Take” feature that allows users to share reaction videos alongside a Quote Tweet.</p><p>With the test, Twitter users can opt to send a “Quote Tweet with reaction” instead of the typical retweet or Quote Tweet. These “Tweet Takes” as the company is calling them can be either a photo or a video, and the original tweet will be embedded as a card overtop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concept is similar to a feature in Twitter’s short-lived Fleets feature, which enabled users to share tweets with their own commentary in a full-screen format. Fleets, of course, never really gained traction and the company pulled the feature less than a month after its launch.</p><div id="1484984092e441aeb4236253898a2b46"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!<br><br>Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. <a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh">pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Fleets, these reaction videos will appear in the main timeline just like any other tweet, though the videos will look noticeably different than the typical retweet.

We’ve reached out to Twitter for more info.)</p><p>But these “takes” are perhaps even more similar to TikTok-style reaction videos, which often feature a comment or another users’ clip as the source. While Twitter hasn’t necessarily encouraged these types of interaction in the past, the company has been taking steps to build more creator-friendly features so it’s not necessarily surprising to see this kind of experiment.</p><p>Of course, just as Twitter users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fleets-harassment-013757824.html">raised concerns</a> about whether Fleets could be used to target people for harassment, tailored reaction videos also feels like the kind of feature that could be ripe for abuse. Quote Tweets are already a major source of dunking and bullying — which Twitter has at times tried<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-twitter-will-test-auto-emojis-to-stop-you-dunk-tweeting.html"><ins> to discourage</ins></a> —  so it’s not difficult to imagine that these “Tweet Takes” could also become problematic. It’s also not clear just how big the initial experiment will be — Twitter often previews new ideas and features in early stages, but not all make it past the testing phase.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-quote-tweet-reaction-videos-223147548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6833952-748c-42c2-95d9-7ad20efca038</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:31:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641508307</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:31:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is experimenting with reaction videos for Quote Tweets.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter reaction videos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Home Hub is a tablet for controlling SmartThings devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the products Samsung showed off at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-2022-supercut-150856924.html">CES 2022 presentation</a> was the Home Hub, an 8.4-inch tablet for controlling all the connected home devices in your household. The company has now <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-home-hub-helps-manage-chores-from-one-central-device">shared</a> more information about it. At launch, the Home Hub will have the ability to connect to every product in the SmartThings ecosystem, including Samsung appliances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f915a0-6f13-11ec-bbfe-69c99639675c" alt="Samsung Home Hub" data-uuid="fe137466-8a06-317c-ba9f-8d902ccf4843"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>In that way, it can tell you how much power your appliances use and if one needs cleaning. Home cooks will find a recipe hub for creating shopping lists and meal plans. Those are just some of the use cases Samsung outlines for the Home Hub. The company says the device’s AI software will anticipate what you need and put that information in front of you exactly when you need it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung has also pledged to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html">Matter standard</a>, which should open the door for the hub to connect to devices from other manufacturers. Based on the photos shared by Samsung, the Home Hub runs Android, suggesting it may also be possible to use it as a standard tablet. The device also comes with two speakers and two microphones, as well as the company’s Bixby assistant. The tablet will come with the charging dock you see pictured in the photos, and you’re free to take it out of that stand.</p><p>At first glance, it’s hard to see the appeal of the Home Hub. After all, it’s essentially a tablet that comes with the company’s SmartThings app preinstalled. You can download that same software on your phone. So it’s not like it’s offering something that isn’t already out there. However, framed another way, it’s a different approach to a smart display. Samsung hasn’t tried to create a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html">Echo Show 15</a> that wants to be the center of your home. The focus here is narrow, and that’s something that could appeal to people.</p><p>Samsung will release the Home Hub in Korea sometime in March, with global availability to follow later. No word yet on US pricing.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-home-hub-ces-2022-221133090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c569a334-73b3-4265-bd5c-6843c0adebc4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:11:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641507095</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T03:42:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
