Bird has <a href="https://www.bird.co/blog/">launched</a> public bikeshare integration for its application, which connects commuters with local providers. In addition the showing locations of nearby stations, the integration will also show the number of bikes currently available in each one and link users to the operators&#39; own apps.</p><p>According to the company, this move is part of its Smart Bikeshare Program announced in June. Bird also said that this allows the company to &quot;strategically meet the multimodal mobility needs of cities without monopolizing transportation options or competing with local businesses.&quot; At the moment, the integration is only live for iOS, though it will make its way to Android &quot;in the near future.&quot; Also, it will only show bikeshares operated by the cities of Oslo (Oslo City Bike), Austin (Metrobike Austin), Los Angeles (Metro Bike), San Antonio (SA Bikeshare) and Milwaukee (Bublr Bikes Milwaukee) in Europe and the US right now.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bird says they&#39;re only the &quot;first&quot; to implement the program, though, so more cities will probably be added in the future. Especially since the company offers public bikeshare integration at no cost to cities and local operators. While Bird is mostly known for its rental scooters, it also has products people who want their own bike can buy. It launched its first electric Bird Bike at the same time it introduced the Smart Bikeshare Program a few years ago, and just last month, it released another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-electric-bike-you-can-buy-120047459.html">e-bike</a> that costs US$2,299.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bird-app-pubic-bikeshare-integration-130047910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24ec9ccf-d4eb-46dd-9d5d-db5f175c1caa</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632310351</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T11:32:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7b9f5c0-1b8f-11ec-97f7-f77ea3d95068" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7b9f5c0-1b8f-11ec-97f7-f77ea3d95068" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Patrick Daxenbichler via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Row of bikes in rental agency, city mobility]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[City mobility and transportation concept: Row of bikes for rental]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit lets anyone design their own muscle-sensing wearables]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MIT has unveiled a new toolkit that lets users design health-sensing devices that can detect how muscles move. The university&#39;s Science and and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/csail">CSAIL</a>) created the kit using something called &quot;electrical impedance tomography&quot; (EIT), that measures internal conductivity to gauge whether muscles are activated or relaxed. The research could allow for wearables that monitor distracted driving, hand gestures or muscle movements for physical rehabilitation.&nbsp;</p><p>In a paper, the researchers wrote that EIT sensing usually requires expensive hardware setups and complex algorithms to decipher the data. The advent of 3D printing, inexpensive electronics and open-source EIT image libraries has made it feasible for more users, but designing a wearable setup is still a challenge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="741ad4aa124b4a4fb2cebb6963e1f4f2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIi0xiMexYU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To that end, the &quot;EIT-kit&quot; 3D editor allows users to enter the device parameters and place the sensors on a device that may go on a user&#39;s wrist or leg, for instance. It can then be exported to a 3D printer and assembled, and the final step is to calibrate the device using a subject. For that, it&#39;s connected to the EIT-kit&#39;s sensing mother board, and &quot;an on-board microcontroller library automates the electrical impedance measurement and lets you see the visual measured data, even on a mobile phone,&quot; according to CSAIL.</p><p>Where most wearables can only sense motion, and EIT device can sense actual muscle activity. The team built one prototype that could sense muscle strain and tension in a subject&#39;s thigh, allowing them to monitor muscle recovery after an injury. It also showed other possible uses, like gesture recognition, a distracted driving detector and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is working with Massachusetts General Hospital on rehabilitation tech using the devices while refining the tech. The eventual aim is to develop &quot;rapid function prototyping techniques and novel sensing technologies,&quot; said lead author Junyi Zhu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-toolkit-allows-you-to-design-your-own-health-monitoring-wearables-130010870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a7f106c-a054-4009-9f63-fcfe0c3ac7c6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632309573</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T11:19:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT/CSAILs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPad mini review (2021): The best small tablet gets a facelift]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="f30705edd63d4e839870bd1ba5f03418"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJAQPqh3DeM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>It’s almost comical how stagnant the iPad mini has been in recent years. The 2019 version sported an upgraded processor and a slightly nicer display, but essentially looked the same as the tablet that debuted in 2012 (which is dated, to say the least). That hasn’t stopped the iPad mini from gaining a loyal following though, and we even called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-ipad-mini-review-2019.html">2019’s mini</a> our favorite small tablet.</p><p>Now it appears that Apple’s giving the tablet the love that its devotees have been asking for. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:6th-generation iPad mini" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">6th-generation iPad mini</a> is really more of an iPad-Air mini with its new “all-screen” Liquid Retina design, TouchID-capable top button, second-generation Apple Pencil support and USB-C charging. It’s the most significant update the mini has received in years, and Apple’s hoping you’ll pay extra for it. The 2021 iPad mini starts at $499, $100 more than its predecessor’s starting price, and with that Apple is squashing any notions that “smaller” means “lesser.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and hardware</h2><p>Many people, myself included, were happy to see the facelift Apple gave the iPad mini. While the old design with the physical Home button isn’t necessarily bad (it’s still good enough for the new 10.2-inch iPad, apparently), it felt boring on the mini after seeing it unchanged for so many years. This year’s iPad mini has what Apple calls an “all-screen” design, which is just different enough from the “edge-to-edge” display that the iPad Pros have to warrant discussion.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e4f7be3d-d63a-4f67-9484-f4ac28054fee"/><p>I understand why Apple didn’t want to give the mini the same “edge-to-edge” moniker, but it could have come up with something a bit better than “all-screen.” The bezel surrounding the 11-inch iPad Pro’s screen is roughly 0.25-inches thick and that of the iPad mini is only about 1/8th of an inch thicker than that. That’s not a huge difference, but it’s more noticeable when you’re only working with an 8.3-inch display. Also, the previous iPad mini had a 7.9-inch display, so you’re not getting a ton of extra screen real estate on the new model.</p><p>That said, I found the bezels to be just the right size. Notably, they helped me get a better grip on the mini when I was using it as an e-reader, and I can only assume many mini owners will do the same. The same could be said for when I was watching YouTube videos while carrying the mini around my apartment — I never accidentally paused the playing video because the bezels gave me enough room to hold the device.</p><p>The new mini’s display size and the fact that it’s a Liquid Retina panel are the upgrades here, because the 5th-gen model supported TrueTone, 500 nits of brightness and the P3 color range as well. This year’s mini has a 2266 x 1488 resolution, 326ppi panel, which is only slightly higher than the old model’s 2048 x 1536 resolution, 326ppi screen. If you upgrade from the 2019 mini, you may not notice a huge difference in quality, but the rounded-rectangle shape of the new mini’s display and the revamped design overall gives it a fresh feel.</p><p>Otherwise, I felt like I had a small version of the iPad Air the entire time I was using the mini. Their designs are very similar, save for the location of certain buttons. The iPad mini now has flat edges with a TouchID-capable power button and volume adjusters at the top and a USB-C port at the bottom. Notably, its edges lack a headphone jack and that may be a key factor for current iPad mini owners in their decision to upgrade or not. It’s made of 100-percent recycled aluminum, weighs less than one pound and measures 6.3mm thick — just as portable as the last model, but with a much-needed modern aesthetic.</p><p>TouchID is nothing different from older iOS devices, although it may take you a tad longer to set up because of how narrow the fingerprint-sensitive button is. It’s exciting that Apple finally brought USB-C to yet another iPad as it makes charging more efficient but it also continues to feed us poor saps who yearn for a USB-C iPhone sometime in our lifetimes. Also, the new design allows the second-generation Apple Pencil to neatly and magnetically stick to the right edge of the tablet.</p><h2>In use</h2><p>I’ve been keeping the iPad mini by my side at all times for the past week or so, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy that was thanks to its size. Every iPad is portable, but some are certainly more portable than others. I have a 2020 11-inch iPad Pro and, while it could come with me almost anywhere, I mostly use it in my home as a secondary device or as my main driver when I’m traveling. The iPad mini, on the other hand, could fit into almost any bag I own without hassle, providing a much-needed larger screen for activities like reading, watching videos and FaceTime calls. I didn’t find it super difficult to use my thumbs to type on the mini, treating it almost like a super-wide iPhone, but I also wouldn’t call it a comfortable experience.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aeceff1e36a84ba194db4a2d654063b5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/703d1740-1ad9-11ec-87fd-a14d268b7118" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="c2a3a301-d3b4-3c9a-9a8a-9c012a14e273"></section><p>Speaking of FaceTime, the iPad mini comes equipped with the new 12MP ultra wide front camera that supports Center Stage, the feature that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls. Each time I used FaceTime, I could move around my (admittedly small) kitchen and the mini’s camera followed me so my family could always see most of my face. There’s a limit, of course — I often stepped out of the camera’s field of view, but it followed me until I was nearly out of the camera’s field of view. This is a handy feature for anyone like me who’s often multitasking while catching up with loved ones over FaceTime.</p><p>The rear camera is also better than that on the previous mini, but I wouldn’t consider it a huge selling point. It’s a 12MP wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED TrueTone flash and Smart HDR 3 support. It can also shoot 4K 60 fps videos and shoot Slo-Mo videos at up to 1080p 240 fps. We’ve all seen a tablet photographer in the wild, but considering the shooters on our phones are far-and-away more capable than those on tablets, most people turn to the smallest screen in their pockets for photography. The pictures of my fiancé and my cat that I took with the mini were just fine, but I found myself more inclined to use the rear camera as a document scanner with Evernote’s Scannable app. And even in that case, was it better than using my iPhone? Not necessarily, just more convenient when I was using the iPad mini as my default device.</p><p>I may not have been taking a ton of photos with the iPad mini, but I use it for almost everything else that I normally turned to my iPhone for. The A15 Bionic chip inside makes the mini feel zippy, and it handled everything that I threw at it well. I spent most of the time watching YouTube and Netflix videos, answering messages in Gmail and Slack, taking notes in Evernote, saving wedding inspo in Pinterest, browsing e-cookbooks in the Kindle app and doodling in Procreate and GoodNotes. The iPad mini didn’t falter once and, in comparison to my iPhone, the tablet’s larger screen made it a much better work companion when I was trying to be productive on the couch. The mini smoothly ran games like <em>Temple Run 2, Crossy Road</em> and <em>High Rise</em> as well, even if my attempts at beating those games were anything but.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6ff2c7d1-1ad9-11ec-9f1f-167f5d1d4fe1" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="b80c4ae9-f469-3a9b-8a68-f361326da19c"><figcaption>The 2021 iPad mini next to Amazon&#39;s Kindle Paperwhite.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While it didn’t affect the performance of the iPad mini I had, the storage capacity on the model you choose may have a significant impact on how you use your mini in the future. The tablet comes in 64GB and 256GB models, with the higher of the two costing $150 more than the other. That’s a significant difference in both capacity and cost, and it follows an unfortunate pattern in the iPad lineup — you’ll find the same pricing structure in the iPad Air configurations. The previous iPad mini had the same minimum storage capacity, so we didn’t even get an upgrade here and that’s a shame.</p><p>While I don’t think most people will be using the iPad mini as a laptop replacement, it would have been nice to have a 128GB model just to have an in-between option for those with tighter budgets. I would also hesitate to recommend the 64GB model to anyone that wants to use their iPad mini as the digital file folder for their documents, photos, books, scans and more. Considering iPadOS 15 takes up 7.5GB of space already, those people may quickly eat up most of their internal storage.</p><h2>With the Apple Pencil</h2><p>Another area that could eat up storage over time are handwritten notes, scribbles, doodles and other artwork you make with the second-generation Apple Pencil. The previous iPad mini supported the first-gen stylus, but I was thrilled to see the newer Apple Pencil snap on to the side of the mini and line up almost perfectly. The Pencil is almost as tall as the tablet so it truly feels like the two were made for each other.</p><p>Since I regularly use the Apple Pencil with my 11-inch iPad Pro, I was not surprised to find that using it with the iPad mini is a similar, yet more constrained, experience. But that’s not a bad thing — I actually think the iPad mini excels at being a digital notebook. It’s portable enough to come with you everywhere you go and it’s much easier to balance in your palm while you jot down notes during a walking meeting. Apple makes it really easy to take notes in iPadOS 15, too, with the Quick Note feature that’s accessible by swiping up from the bottom-right corner of the iPad. It opens a small window on the screen into which you can scribble a quick grocery list or something you don’t want to forget. Those Quick Notes get saved in the Notes app, where you can retrieve and edit them at any time.</p><p>Apple’s made the Notes app more robust over the years, so much so that it could be your main note-taking tool. But there’s no shortage of capable apps in which to use the Apple Pencil and I was happy to find that two popular ones, Procreate and GoodNotes, work just as well on the iPad mini as any other iPad. Serious artists will probably want to spring for an iPad with a larger screen because it just gives you more space to play with, both in regular and Split View. But those who are visual thinkers, those who prefer to sketch out their thoughts, will probably find the mini’s screen to be sufficient. For example, I’m in the early stages of planning a wedding and I took the iPad mini with me on a few venue tours. Not only was it much less ostentatious to take around than my larger iPad, but I could also snap quick photos with it, bring those images into Procreate, pull out colors I liked in venue fixtures and decorations and experiment with them in concept sketches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/705189a0-1ad9-11ec-b79e-f4c3ae445fad" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="8e92632f-c3cc-3928-90bd-49bea15bb6ea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Battery life</h2><p>One thing that hasn’t changed about the iPad mini is its estimated battery life. Just like the 2019 model, Apple estimates the slab should get up to 10 hours of battery life, and again, that’s a bit of a lowball. With how much I was using the device, I essentially had to charge it every other day. The mini lasted an entire afternoon and evening filled with doodling, video streaming, emailing, light gaming and more (I used it instead of my phone for almost every task), and I was able to use it most of the next day before the battery life dropped to around 10 percent. I also ran a makeshift battery test on it, playing a video clip on repeat until the tablet died, and the mini lasted just about 12 hours.</p><p>Unlike the previous mini, the new model uses a USB-C port for charging and it’s about time. It’s good to see Apple transitioning the iPad family to USB-C, even if most people looking to buy an iPad mini probably already have a few Lightning cables strewn around their home. The mini also comes with Apple’s 20W USB-C charger, which should help power-up the device quickly.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad mini&#x002019;s" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">iPad mini’s</a> spec sheet has changed quite a bit, but the appeal of the tablet remains the same. It looks and feels different thanks to the redesign and the handful of new features Apple brought to it. Still, the iPad mini remains one of Apple’s most niche devices. But niche doesn’t mean less-than — with the iPad mini so similar to the iPad Air, you won’t be sacrificing much by choosing it. However, I don’t think most people will take a look at all the new perks — things like a camera with Center Stage, USB-C charging and even the A15 Bionic chip — and be persuaded to choose the iPad mini over any other Apple tablet.</p><p>What it will come down to, as always, is size. The iPad mini remains the best small tablet out there and you probably already know if an 8-inch tablet has a place in your life. It either solves a specific problem, or it doesn’t — and if you fall into the second category, you probably prefer bigger screens anyway.</p><p>But if you updated in 2019 to the 5th-generation iPad mini, the decision to upgrade now is not entirely cut-and-dry and that’s mostly due to cost. If the 6th-generation iPad mini had the same $399 starting price as the previous model, it would be a no-brainer upgrade. Sure, that extra $100 does get you a lot, but if your 2019 iPad mini is still going strong, the higher price of the 2021 model may be too great. But for those who have a hole in their lives where a small tablet could fit, you (still) can’t get better than the iPad mini.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa628cfc-23bf-44f7-874e-02ef1d7dcf52</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632313056</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T12:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Guardians of the Galaxy' is already better than the 'Avengers' game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this point in the creeping global takeover of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, most people have a clear idea of who the Guardians of the Galaxy are, at least according to James Gunn. There’s the bald dude who’s a tree, Zoe Saldana in green body paint, the other bald dude who isn’t a tree, Bradley Cooper as a raunchy raccoon, and the guy who used to be on <em>Parks and Recreation</em>.</p><p>This isn’t the case in <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and that’s a good thing. The game introduces fresh versions of the Guardians and ensures players will get to know them, placing an active emphasis on relationship-building and teamwork, rather than running and gunning. Eidos-Montréal’s interpretation of the Milano crew is familiar but refreshing, and the characters in the game are just as charming as they are in the MCU — if not moreso.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee536e0-1b24-11ec-8f3f-bd5afd25cd11" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="f652380d-680c-3a89-b3b0-11bfa82c808d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>The preview for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> lasted about an hour and dropped me in the middle of chapter five: Star-Lord and his pals are on the Milano, debating whether they should pay a fine at Nova Corps headquarters. They banter and decide to do it, intermittently dealing with a purple-and-orange llama that’s stowed away on their ship from a previous mission. The llama’s name is Kammy. Drax, the vengeful yet simple warrior, calls it “the child.” It’s all very cute.</p><p>Star-Lord is the only playable character in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but he’s able to interact with and even direct his teammates, taking advantage of their unique skills as needed. For instance, Rocket, the foul-mouthed raccoon, is good at hacking doorways, crawling through vents and fixing things, though he’ll give you an earful while he does it.</p><p>By chapter five, Star-Lord has a handful of skills and tools, including the ability to scan his environments for areas of interest or weakness. Using this overlay turns the landscape into an infrared world of neon silhouettes and bright yellow clues. If Star-Lord himself can’t use a particular item, chances are someone on his team can, and he’s able to work with them once he’s found the way forward.</p><div id="d1021a88b7fe4184a7aa3406e589da8a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oki56MQfiHI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In combat, Star-Lord can instruct his crewmates to use their special moves at any particular time, and they also react automatically to nearby enemy behavior. For example, Star-Lord can freeze an enemy with his ice gun and Groot, the powerful tree creature, will start wailing on the frozen foe, no player input required. There’s also a huddle function that can turn the tide of a big battle — Peter Quill calls the team together and listens to their thoughts on how the fight is going, and then he determines whether to encourage them or check their egos using a range of 1980s pop-rock lyrics. If he picks the right tone, the entire team gets a big boost so they can start spamming attacks; if he picks the wrong words, only Star-Lord gets the damage augmentation.</p><p>Fights in chapter five are fast-paced and packed with enemies, meaning the Guardians are often spread across the environment, waging their own tiny wars. Star-Lord’s ability to call in his crewmates’ special powers adds a layer of rapid-fire strategy to the gunbattles, and this system should only become more robust as the game progresses.</p><p>Interacting with the Guardian NPCs is a critical component of the game’s non-combat moments, when players have to communicate and solve puzzles to progress. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> uses a Telltale-style narrative system that alerts players with text in the upper-right corner when something significant has gone down — think “Gamora will remember that” — and in conversation, there are often multiple responses for players to choose from, sometimes with a timer attached. Seemingly innocuous decisions, such as whether to respond to an audio cue, can significantly change how the game plays out, for instance jump-starting a battle or creating an opportunity for the Guardians to sneak in.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0824bb06a9354d119398b86dc336a5c0" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee4e8c0-1b24-11ec-b7eb-38923e2e0281" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="937f5467-08e2-383b-bbe7-635e3ec25d75"></section><p>Relationships are everything in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. The core theme of the game is grief, according to developers, and even as the Guardians joke their way across the stars, they each deal with a unique sense of loss. This is, ironically, what brings them together. The game&#39;s music plays into the emotional mood, with plenty of licensed ’80s hits and an original album from Star-Lord that taps into feelings of being an outcast and finding your chosen family.</p><p>It’s hard to say if Eidos-Montréal has captured the right balance of emotion and action throughout <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but the preview is encouraging. The developers aren’t afraid to let dialogue and puzzle-solving breathe for long stretches of the action, while battles themselves are full and frenzied. At any rate, it already feels way better than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-poor-sales-195000119.html"><em>Marvel’s Avengers</em></a>.</p><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is due to hit PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 on October 26th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/guardians-galaxy-game-preview-marvel-square-enix-130003598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">481fed65-48e6-4b88-a813-de096d46cb54</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632260918</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T21:48:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's department store plans reportedly include high-tech dressing rooms]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Amazon opens mini department stores <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-department-stores-122954800.html">as rumored</a>, they could include high-tech dressing rooms and the retailer&#39;s own private-label clothing brands, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report. The aim is apparently to address some of the normal irritants of clothes shopping, increase its own brand recognition and make the stores as efficient as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One idea is that customers would use a smartphone app to scan QR codes of items they want to try on. Associates would then gather the items and place them in fitting rooms, and the process could eventually become more automated with the use of robots.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once inside, you&#39;d be able to ask for more clothes using a touchscreen, which could also recommend items you might like based on what you&#39;ve chosen so far.

It has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-03-amazon-patent-mirror-virtual-clothes.html">patented a mirror</a> for trying on virtual clothes, but there&#39;s no sign yet that it would use such technology in department stores.

At 30,000 square feet, however, they&#39;d still be larger than Amazon&#39;s other physical locations other than Whole Foods.</p><p>Even as some physical retailers including JC Penney and Niemen Marcus filed for bankruptcy, Amazon saw sales explode during the pandemic as users shopped online from home. However, customers surveyed recently by Wells Fargo said they preferred the physical department store experience and didn&#39;t want to pay for shipping if they weren&#39;t Prime members, the <em>WSJ</em> noted. On top of clothing, Amazon&#39;s department stores would reportedly allow it to showcase electronics like Fire TVs, readers, Echo speakers and more.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is still a rumor which hasn&#39;t been confirmed by Amazon, so take it with some skepticism. Considering how quickly the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">expanding</a> into brick-and-mortar retail right now, though, it does make sense.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-department-store-plans-reportedly-include-high-tech-dressing-rooms-123535220.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3931b22b-b35d-4421-9119-194905f27ea2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 12:35:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632313905</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T12:31:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61ee49d0-1b9b-11ec-bebf-6dc01948177e" width="1000" height="625" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61ee49d0-1b9b-11ec-bebf-6dc01948177e" width="1000" height="625" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's department store plans reportedly include high-tech dressing rooms]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's department store plans reportedly include high-tech dressing rooms]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The iPhone 13 review is here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll admit, I never believed that Apple would release a phone called the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html"><ins>iPhone 13, or the 13 Mini</ins></a>, for obvious reasons.

Two years, and multiple design improvements later, PFF is set to release a smaller, more nimble version which they&#39;re calling the Gitamini<em>&nbsp;</em>this October.</p><p>With a cargo volume of up to nearly 2,000 cubic inches and capable of carrying up to 44 pounds of gear and traveling at a top speed of 22 mph, the original Gita was a startlingly large machine able to hold a shopping carts-worth of groceries and keep up with cyclists. However, the Gita&#39;s size made it a liability to other pedestrians when navigating on crowded sidewalks, especially the earlier versions that relied on a belt-mounted tracker to know where its owners were.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Gitamini, on the other hand, is about the size of a Border Collie (990 cubic square inches of cargo space) and weighs just 28 pounds. It can carry up to 20 pounds of gear and thanks to external handles the mini can easily be hoisted over curbs, stairs and other obstacles even when fully loaded. The mini is rated for a maximum range of 21 miles or around six hours of use before needing a recharge. What&#39;s more, PFF has traded in the belt-based tracker for advanced optics and machine vision.

In fact, as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9633425/twitch-nmpa-music-publishers-agreement"><em>Billboard</em></a> points out, it&#39;s not a licensing deal at all. According to the publication, the Amazon-owned livestreaming service made a financial settlement for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riaa-nmpa-letter-to-twitch-on-unlicensed-music-151703321.html">past usage</a> of licensed music on the platform. Twitch has also told creators in an email that it&#39;s putting together a new process that publishers and right holders can use to report content.&nbsp;</p><p>The new process is different from a DMCA and will start with a warning instead of a penalty. When a rights holder reports a stream, Twitch will issue a warning and remove the clips containing unauthorized music. In case of a flagrant violation — say, the rebroadcasting of concerts and the leak of unreleased tracks — then Twitch may issue a penalty outright, depending on the user&#39;s history.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its email, Twitch says the new process is more forgiving of users who may have inadvertently caught music they have no authority to use in their streams. Mike Futter of <a href="https://virtualeconcast.com/"><em>Virtual Economy Podcast</em></a> notes, though, that the new process just makes it easier for music publishers to flag users and that it doesn&#39;t make things better for creators. Streamers can&#39;t dispute a report if they&#39;re flagged for violation, since Twitch will just remove their videos.

Without much fanfare, the company has been quietly working on a free Oculus Quest game called <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3632378823549307/"><em>Eden Unearthed</em></a>. Spotted by <a href="https://uploadvr.com/netflix-eden-unearthed-app-lab/"><em><ins>UploadVR</ins></em></a>, the game is available through the App Lab, which means it hasn’t gone through the full Oculus review process. The listing says the game was both developed and published by Netflix, but provides few other hints about its origins.</p><p>What we can say is that it was almost certainly envisioned as a tie-in for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html"><em><ins>Eden </ins></em><ins>anime series</ins></a> the company released back in May. What’s interesting here is that there are two separate versions of the app with different release dates listed. The v0.7 release came out on April 20th, while the v0.8 was released in August. That fact, along with the App Lab listing, would appear to suggest Netflix is still working on the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, it’s hard to say whether <em>Eden Unearthed </em>represents the kind of video game release we can expect from Netflix moving forward. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html"><ins>hired former Oculus and EA executive Mike Verdu</ins></a> to help it build out a gaming team. At the time, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported the company’s plan was to offer games alongside its traditional video offerings within the next year. We’ve reached out to Netflix for more information on the <em>Eden Unearthed</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-eden-unearthed-vr-oculus-214541602.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24761116-dcb2-4f45-95d6-eb1d825f36c1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:45:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632260102</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T21:35:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/739bbde0-1b21-11ec-bbea-c92b45cd2b3e" width="1104" height="620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/739bbde0-1b21-11ec-bbea-c92b45cd2b3e" width="1104" height="620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eden Unearthed]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eden Unearthed]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Researchers say Facebook is interfering with their tools to study News Feed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook quietly pushed out changes to News Feed that’s “interfering” with the browser-based tools used by journalists and researchers, <a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/21/facebook-rolls-out-news-feed-change-that-blocks-watchdogs-from-gathering-data">according to</a><em>The Markup</em>, the nonprofit news organization behind Citizen Browser.</p><p>According to the report, Facebook has been adding “junk code to HTML features meant to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.” The resulting code prevents browsers from automatically collecting data about posts in News Feed, and may also be hindering screen readers used by blind and visually impaired users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The change has affected both <em>The Markup’s</em> Citizen Browser, as well as New York University’s Ad Observer, a browser extension that has helped researchers study political ads and vaccine misinformation.

Last month, the company disabled the personal Facebook accounts of NYU researchers working with Ad Observer saying they broke the company’s privacy rules.

As <em>The Markup</em> and Edelson point out, the changes could affect screen readers, an important accessibility technology. They cite at least  one instance of the code appearing to cause a screen reader to read out some of these “junk” characters. The changes may have also contributed to problems with some ad blockers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-interfering-research-tools-the-markup-212026086.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a115d379-3584-421f-a156-389204ced9e8</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 21:20:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632259228</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T21:20:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/ef09f100-f772-11ea-befb-96728ec8cae5" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/ef09f100-f772-11ea-befb-96728ec8cae5" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logo of Facebook displayed on a smartphone screen and keyboard are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 11, 2020.

With the move, the agency is separating its existing Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate into the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate (ESDMD) and Space Operations Mission Directorate. NASA said it&#39;s making the change in response to the increasing number of missions it&#39;s conducting in low-Earth orbit, in addition to the plans it has for exploring deep space in the future.</p><p>It also announced who&#39;s leading those units. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/nac/members/JamesFree">Jim Free</a>, a NASA veteran who has been with the space agency on and off since 1990, is the new associate administrator of ESDMD, while <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Lueders">Kathy Lueders</a> is taking on the equivalent position at the Space Operations Mission Directorate. Before becoming the first-ever woman to oversee human spaceflight at NASA, Lueders managed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-dragon-successful-splashdown-184812158.html">Commercial Crew Program</a>. As for what the two units will do, ESDMD will oversee the development of programs critical to Project Artemis and eventually manned spaceflight to Mars.

In that way, the agency says there will be a constant cycle of development and operations to help it move forward with its space exploration goals.</p><p>&quot;This reorganization positions NASA and the United States for success as we venture farther out into the cosmos than ever before, all while supporting the continued commercialization of space and research on the International Space Station,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;This also will allow the United States to maintain its leadership in space for decades to come.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-directorate-reorganization-175038234.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7703fd3b-0068-40b4-87b9-313360002149</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:50:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632246641</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:50:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-06/53043cd0-8ecc-11e9-b2ff-c66f74d182a8" width="4942" height="3295" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/53043cd0-8ecc-11e9-b2ff-c66f74d182a8" width="4942" height="3295" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mampfred via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Merritt Island, Florida, USA - September 10, 2011: Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, which was first used to assemble the massive American Saturn V launch vehicles, on  Merritt Island, Florida]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vehicle Assembly Building]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Treasury sanctions cryptocurrency exchange for aiding ransomware attacks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The hints of a Treasury Department <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-treasury-department-crypto-sanctions-ransomware-165049611.html">crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges</a> were apparently accurate. The Treasury has <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364">imposed</a> sanctions on the SUEX crypto exchange for allegedly &quot;facilitating&quot; ransomware attacks. SUEX reportedly helped launder the ill-gotten gains from at least eight ransomware variants, and is so in demand that over 40 percent of its known transactions come from &quot;illicit actors,&quot; according to the Department.</p><p>The move blocks SUEX&#39;s access to property (and interests in property) covered by US jurisdiction. The block also extends to any entity where the exchange owns a controlling stake, and prevents banks and people from making &quot;certain transactions.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Treasury stressed that it believed &quot;most&quot; cryptocurrency activity was legal, and that some exchanges merely fall victim to ransomware attackers.

Rather than trying to disrupt the overall cryptocurrency landscape, the US appears focused on individual exchanges and traders. This theoretically discourages others from handling ransomware payments while reassuring those who stick to above-board deals. Of course, there&#39;s only so much the government can do — less-than-reputable exchanges may simply look for partners the US can&#39;t touch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-treasury-sanctions-suex-ransomware-172601658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79a7b1a9-4974-4576-9590-aae6d1396899</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:26:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244510</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:15:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1eb2dca0-1af9-11ec-b75f-c1d4abddb77e" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1eb2dca0-1af9-11ec-b75f-c1d4abddb77e" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[mikkelwilliam via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Criminal hiding behind a mask turns up on computer screen asking the owner for money.

All of the processing would take place on the device, with no data sent to Apple servers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is working on research projects that could lead to the development of these features. The University of California, Los Angeles, is studying stress, anxiety and depression, with Apple Watch and iPhone data for 3,000 volunteers being tracked in a study that starts this year. A pilot phase that began in 2020 recorded data from 150 participants.</p><p>Researchers will compare data captured from iPhone and Watch sensors with questionnaires participants fill out about how they feel, according to the report. They&#39;re also said to be measuring the level of the stress hormone cortisol in participants&#39; hair follicles. Apple and UCLA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html"><ins>announced the three-year study</ins></a> in August 2020.</p><p>Another research project is underway that may factor into this Apple project. The company and pharmaceutical firm Biogen <a href="https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-launch-pioneering-study-develop-digital-biomarkers">said</a> in January they&#39;re working on a two-year study to monitor cognitive function and perhaps spot mild cognitive impairment, which has the potential to develop into Alzheimer’s. The plan is to track around 20,000 participants, around half of whom have high risk of cognitive impairment.</p><p>If data from the studies lines up with symptoms of depression or anxiety, Apple could use it to create a feature that warns users if it sees signs of a mental health condition. The iPhone could prompt users to seek care, which could be important as early detection can improve quality of life in the long run.</p><p>Apple and its partners are in the early stages of this work, so it&#39;ll likely be a few years at least before the company adds mental health monitoring features to the iPhone. There&#39;s no guarantee the research will lead to such features at all.</p><p>Some previous studies have indicated people with certain conditions use devices differently than other folks. It&#39;s not yet clear whether developers can build algorithms that can detect mental health conditions reliably and accurately.</p><p>Still, there&#39;s no smoke without fire. Health has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html"><ins>a growing focus</ins></a> for Apple over the past few years, so there&#39;s a chance features based on this research will eventually emerge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mental-health-condition-detection-iphone-report-171343401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cefbd62-f9f4-4e28-b943-73d54a49f3d1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:13:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244425</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:13:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mental Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM details the motors that will power its electric Hummer and other EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>General Motors has spent a lot of time recently talking up the capabilities of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery technology</a> but has said significantly less so about the motors those cells will power.

It’s no surprise, then, that the company is doubling down on the concept. Today, Facebook is announcing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:two new Portals" href="https://fave.co/2XEiZrZ">two new Portals</a>: an updated Portal+ for $349, plus a brand new $199 Portal Go that is also the company’s first-ever portable smart display.</p><p>Yes, in brief, that means the Go can actually be taken out of its charging dock and toted around. There’s also an integrated handle on the back for easy carrying. Despite the handle, it has a relatively compact form factor, with a 10-inch, 1,280 x 800 display housed inside a soft fabric-wrapped enclosure.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea behind this portable Portal, according to Facebook, is that you can keep the device in, say, a kitchen or an office, and it can then be moved around the house if the family is congregating in a different room. Of course, since it’s portable, it can also be brought outdoors as long as you have a relatively strong WiFi signal. Since it can stream music from sources like Spotify, you can also use the Go as a portable speaker.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/200ac590-1806-11ec-b7ff-f5dc57afcf76" alt="Portal Go" data-uuid="dcd3f13d-7af1-38ab-a1d1-e329022642e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>As for battery life, Facebook says that you will likely get up to five hours of one-on-one Messenger calling on a single charge and up to 14 hours of music playback if the screen is off.</p><p>In addition, the company unveiled a new Portal+, which hasn’t been updated since the original debuted in 2018. While we thought the first-gen model was a bit of an eyesore, the new Portal+ brings a much-improved design. With a 14-inch, 2,140 x 1,440 display, it still has the largest screen out of all the Portals, but its footprint is much smaller than before. The Portal+ display can also be tilted up and down to accommodate different heights.</p><p>Both the new Portals have a 12-megapixel camera with an ultra-wide field of view. Like the other Portals, these make use of Facebook&#39;s so-named Smart Camera technology, which uses AI to follow you around the room, panning and zooming to keep you in frame the entire time. There’s also a smart sound tech that allows you speak at a normal volume, regardless of the distance between you and the device, and still have your callers hear you clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, with any Facebook product, privacy and security are obvious concerns. To help allay those fears, both the new Portals have built-in camera lens covers, and there are buttons at the top that disconnects the camera and the microphone. The smart camera AI technology mentioned earlier runs locally on the device and not on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted by default. On <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-e2ee-voice-video-calls-group-instagram-164140952.html">Messenger,</a> however, you’ll have to specify the contacts and groups you want to enable the end-to-end encryption (and even this feature is still in the roll-out phase).</p><p>Aside from new hardware, Facebook also detailed some incoming software updates. One of them is Household Mode, which essentially lets you share the Portal with the whole family. In Household Mode, you can allow access to a selection of shared apps and contacts, while keeping the rest personal. For example, then, you can let the whole family use apps like Messenger and WhatsApp, and allow them to call grandma and grandpa, but they won’t be able to contact anyone else unless you let them. You can set up a screen lock passcode to control access to the device as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5d84fdf0-1806-11ec-bfed-68b238d81835" alt="Portal+ home screen" data-uuid="9686e760-e8dd-3756-a591-6f6d25a97339"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>The Portal home screen has also been redesigned to be more personalized, with a top row of favorite contacts, and a card interface similar to the one on other smart displays. There’s a card for Messenger Rooms, one for Spotify playlist shortcuts, another for most used apps, and more. As for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html">Portal TV</a>, the company will soon be updating it so that you can see calling notifications like a pending Rooms invitation or a missed video call.</p><p>Additionally, Facebook has updated the Watch Together experience on Portal so it can be used not just on Portal-to-Portal calls, but also with Messenger pals on the phone, laptop or tablet. On top of that, the company says it’s bringing WhatsApp multi-device support to Portal in the next few months. This lets you use WhatsApp on your phone as well as four non-phone devices at the same time.</p><p>Facebook is aware that Portals can be used not just in the home context, but also for business purposes. That’s why it will be adding support for Microsoft Teams for all Portal devices starting this December. (It added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-zoom-workplace-140020249.html">Zoom, WebEx, BlueJeans and GotoMeeting</a> last year.) There will also be a new Calendar app, which lets you view your Outlook or Google calendar on Portal. The beauty of this is that you could then jump in on your next meeting with a single tap on the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bdc111e0-1806-11ec-af7e-1031e867704c" alt="Portal+ and Portal Go" data-uuid="938f8aef-5739-38ff-96e5-5bf89a89df7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>In addition, Facebook is introducing Portal for Business specifically for small businesses to deploy and manage Portal devices. They can create and manage Facebook Work Accounts which lets employees use company email addresses to set up the Portal. IT admins can use a Portal Device Manager to manage the devices remotely.</p><p>According to Facebook, the 8-inch Portal Mini will be discontinued, but the Portal TV and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">2019 10-inch Portal that requires a power cord</a> will still be available.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pre-orders" href="https://fave.co/2XEiZrZ">Pre-orders</a> for both the Portal Go and the new Portal+ start today. They will begin shipping October 19th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ce41249-7886-4c91-b179-46f07bf92784</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244539</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:15:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b2733300-1805-11ec-b77b-d96fafb1090f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b2733300-1805-11ec-b77b-d96fafb1090f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Portal+ and Portal Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portal+ and Portal Go]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
