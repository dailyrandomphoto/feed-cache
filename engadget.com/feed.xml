With the expansion, more than 800,000 students can take part in a curriculum designed by the company, at the end of which they can earn a certificate or associate degree in artificial intelligence.</p><p>The program includes courses on data collection, computer vision, model training, coding and AI ethics. In addition to designing the curriculum, Intel has provided training and technical advice to the college faculty involved in the program. Dell is also helping with technical and infrastructure expertise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Carlos Contreras, senior director of AI and digital readiness at Intel, the program consists of four parts. In the initial “Awareness” section, a teacher introduces students to some of the “possibilities” and “issues” around AI, with an emphasis on class discussion. The following two parts involve a lot of hands-on learning while students are gradually introduced to the technical skills they need to become proficient in the field. The final part of the program, “Capstone,” sees students asked to create and present projects that use AI to impact society.</p><p>For Intel, the company says working with community colleges offers a chance to “democratize AI technology.” Citing <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/research-trends/fast-facts/">data from the American Association of Community Colleges</a>, the company notes they attract people from various backgrounds and walks of life. But as with most programs of this type, it’s also an opportunity for the company to find candidates in a demanding field. It’s no accident then Intel plans to expand the program to include 50 more schools by 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ai-for-workforce-2021-expansion-130027058.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fbb046d-fd61-41f2-8050-33a185a156a2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627989377</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T11:16:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Schools]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JLab debuts $20 true wireless earbuds with 8-hour battery life and touch controls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, I found out just how solid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">a pair of $29 true wireless earbuds</a> could be. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-jlab-go-air-wireless-earbuds.html">JLab&#39;s Go Air</a> covers all the basics even though they lack the polish of more expensive sets. For its latest buds, <a href="https://www.jlab.com/products/go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds">the Go Air Pop</a>, the company is taking things a step further with better battery life and a fully enclosed charging case. JLab cut the price even more too: these earbuds will only cost you $20.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Go Air, you&#39;ll get all of the core functionality of true wireless earbuds with the Go Air Pop. That includes on-board touch controls, the ability to use either earbud independently, EQ presets and IPX4 moisture resistance. The overall design of the buds is also similar, although JLab says the Go Air Pop is 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the Go Air.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13b91bf0-f40e-11eb-a57d-e6fed4130f41" alt="JLab Go Air Pop" data-uuid="9a1f3b2f-d6c9-3b9e-86cc-a77467a1d9b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLab</div></figure><p>The biggest differences are the case and the battery life. The Go Air comes in an open case with an attached USB cable that tucks in the bottom. The integrated plug is back on the Go Air Pop, but the case has a lid like almost every other set of true wireless buds.  JLab extended battery life to eight hours on the buds themselves, up from five on the Go Air. The case will give you three additional charges before you&#39;ll need to plug the whole set in.&nbsp;</p><p>JLab isn&#39;t the only company cranking out sub-$30 true wireless earbuds. Skullcandy debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-dime-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-120012848.html">the $25 Dime</a> back in March, a set of buds with a more AirPod-like design. The Dime can only muster three and a half hours on a charge, but it does offer on-board controls and IPX4 water resistance for your workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The Go Air Pop will ship in late August. When it does, you can choose between black, lilac, rose, slate and teal color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2799a6f1-c087-4045-a8a8-57e4f6152655</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627963302</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T04:01:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JLab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Realme's 'MagDart' is an Android take on MagSafe, but faster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-magsafe-iphone-173957651.html">MagSafe</a> made its grand return by way of the iPhone 12 series, it was only a matter of time before other phone makers came up with similar — and maybe better — solutions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/realme">Realme</a>, the sister brand of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oppo">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oneplus">OnePlus</a>, has announced its very own &quot;MagDart&quot; magnetic wireless charging system as part of its latest concept phone, the Flash.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5228b560-f451-11eb-bbbf-4037e39b11e5" style="height:1011;width:1600;" alt="Realme 50W MagDart" data-uuid="245e2e67-8483-3fe4-aa35-70ee20534983"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>Not only is MagDart the first of its kind in the Android world, it&#39;s also more powerful than Apple&#39;s MagSafe, with its maximum output rated at 50W instead of just 15W. This 50W magnetic charger leverages Realme&#39;s speedy 65W SuperDart charging tech — a rebranded version of Oppo&#39;s SuperVOOC and OnePlus&#39; Warp Charge 65 — and has its own air-cooling system for maximum performance. Realme claims that the charging speed here is almost on par with its 50W SuperDart wired charger. Specifically, for the 4,500mAh battery inside the Realme Flash, it&#39;ll go from zero to 100 percent in under an hour.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The downside of this 50W MagDart charger is its bulkiness, but Realme will also offer a slim 15W MagDart charging pad — one that&#39;s a tad thinner than Apple&#39;s MagSafe charger. This design is mainly thanks to having the circuit board tucked away in the plug, which also keeps the charging coil cooler for higher efficiency. For the same phone, this will take about 90 minutes to go from zero to 100 percent.</p><p>Naturally, the MagDart ecosystem offers a few other snap-on accessories as well. There&#39;s a MagDart power bank which one-ups the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-147-magsafe-battery-pack-apple-card-podcasts-homepod-192323154.html">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> by doubling as a wireless charging stand, so you can charge or grab both the phone and the power bank simultaneously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65a17320-f451-11eb-b976-2d90c15961fa" style="height:758;width:1516;" alt="MagDart 2-in-1 power bank, 50W MagDart charger, 15W MagDart charger, MagDart beauty light, MagDart wallet and MagDart case for Realme GT." data-uuid="6090cf69-d685-3473-8db4-45b43744fb02"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>There&#39;s also a MagDart Beauty Light, which is a flip-up ring light — consisting of 60 mini LEDs, with adjustable brightness and color temperature — to keep your selfie game strong. Interestingly, this kit is powered by the phone&#39;s reverse wireless charging feature.</p><p>Another handy accessory here is the self-explanatory MagDart Wallet, which holds up to three credit cards in its vegan leather pockets. Though unlike the MagSafe version, this one adds an aluminum kickstand to your phone as well.</p><p>Last but not least, existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-snapdragon-888-launch-price-availability-184917902.html">Realme GT</a> users can get a special case to make their phone MagDart-compatible, though this will add a slight bulge near the bottom on the back side.</p><p>There&#39;s no word on when we will see the first MagDart-compatible devices on the market just yet, but when that happens, chances are future products from Oppo and OnePlus will get to share the love with Realme (unless Apple gets in the way, of course). But if you use a pacemaker, then you&#39;ll probably want to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pacemaker-device-warning-list-210820634.html">avoid</a> those also.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/realme-flash-magdart-android-apple-magsafe-125551887.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0074099c-07a8-4feb-828f-b07b1dfb602a</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 12:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627995371</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:56:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32de4d50-f451-11eb-bdfe-de309c4bd94d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32de4d50-f451-11eb-bdfe-de309c4bd94d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Realme]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Realme Flash]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Realme Flash]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First-gen Echo Show 5 returns to an all-time low of $45 on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now grab the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jybf1F">first-gen Echo Show 5</a> for $45 on Amazon, if you didn&#39;t get the chance to do so on Prime Day in June and on Black Friday last year. The Alexa-powered smart display is also currently available for $45 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html">on Best Buy</a>, but you now have another option if you&#39;d rather purchase it from Amazon for Prime shipping or any other reason.

And, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review of the newer device</a>, its changes are pretty minor. Instead of a one-megapixel camera, you now get 2 megapixels, which isn&#39;t that much of an upgrade. The newer smart display also comes in a light blue option, while its predecessor is only available in black and white. That&#39;s pretty much it, though — the display&#39;s resolution remains the same, and it still doesn&#39;t come with features its bigger counterpart, the Echo Show 8, has.</p><p>As we said in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">review</a> for the first-gen Echo Show 5, it&#39;s meant for those who want a smaller Amazon smart display that&#39;s also a decent alarm clock. It has a sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens the screen 15 minutes before the time you set, and it has ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the screen&#39;s brightness based on your surroundings. You can also use it to display photos and watch videos, though, if you don&#39;t mind the smaller screen. The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, and you can always access YouTube using its built-in browsers.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-gen-echo-show-5-all-time-low-amazon-122943901.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48f7402f-31e5-4a09-8887-7781f1bcf23d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 12:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627993821</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:30:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is offering $10 in credit for your palm print]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is offering $10 in promotional credit to get people to sign up to its palm print payments system.

Improvements are teased across voice and speech processing — think Google Assistant — as well as photography and video recording, which all sounds like the sixth addition will continue to play to the Pixel series’ strengths.</p><p>Rick Osterloh, in conversation with Engadget, explained — but without getting specific — that the Pixel 6 series will include larger imaging sensors than before. He said the Pixel 6’s main camera will let in about 150% more light than previous Pixels. The Pro alone gets an extra telephoto option with 4x optical zoom, which will certainly help me decide between the two. All that’s really left to hear is the price and the release date.</p><p>- Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html">Amazon&#39;s Lord of the Rings series arrives on September 2, 2022</a></h2><h3>Just over a year to wait.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/16365f50-f3be-11eb-87ef-a70bec44b1de" style="height:1075;width:2400;" alt="Lord of the Rings series " data-uuid="6d44c57b-1e85-30c2-8165-bd9c7c209275"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon Studios</div></figure></a><h3></h3><p>Amazon&#39;s long-awaited The Lord of the Rings series finally has a release date.

Following news of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-premium-lite-113540988.html">YouTube Premium Lite</a> offering yesterday, Spotify is the latest streamer to confirm a cheaper tier. The world&#39;s biggest music streaming service is testing a $0.99 monthly plan that retains the ads but gives you infinite skips per hour and lets you select specific songs on an album or playlist for playback. Spotify, which confirmed the test to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607203/spotify-plus-ad-supported-tier-unlimited-skips-on-demand-listening"><em>The Verge</em></a>, is hoping it can convince you to put up with ads in return for more control over the listening experience. In other words, it wants to have its cake and eat it, too.</p><p>Currently, free users can only skip six tracks per hour and have to listen to shuffled songs on albums and playlists. That&#39;s a bummer if you&#39;re sick of hearing Justin Bieber or just want to put that one new Billie Eillish track on repeat. Despite those incentives, getting people to pay for an ad-supported service, even if it is just $0.99 per month, is still a big ask. Especially when they&#39;re accustomed to getting it for free. Then again, video streamers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-31-hulu-ads-pause-break-spring.html">Hulu</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-ad-supported-plan-details-release-date-165738658.html">HBO Max</a> have either successfully done it or are trying to do it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The risk is that it could eat into Spotify&#39;s existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-q2-2021-premium-users-103530500.html">premium user base</a>, which make up 165 million of its 365 million subscribers. Turning those remaining 200 million users into paying members is clearly the goal here. It could be that the low $0.99 price helps to ease that transition. We&#39;ll know if the gamble has paid off if Spotify expands the plan to more users. In the past, the company has done just that with new plans, including its $12.99/month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-premium-duo-streaming-plan-us-pricing-details-100016592.html">Duo</a> tier aimed at discouraging password sharing and its upcoming Lossless &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html">HiFi</a>&quot; offering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-free-skip-tracks-100956489.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d35dd796-e459-4312-92d5-3578e5740c63</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 10:09:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627985399</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T10:10:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27552d70-f440-11eb-8ffe-88fedd1033ca" width="4017" height="2678" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27552d70-f440-11eb-8ffe-88fedd1033ca" width="4017" height="2678" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Taylor Hill via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - MAY 20:  Spotify founder Daniel Ek speaks during the Spotify New Platform Launch at S.I.R.

The key product is the Zone True Wireless Earbuds, which the company says are the first to be certified by the three major video conferencing platforms: Zoom, Google Meet and Microsoft Teams. Another unique feature is support for not just Bluetooth, but Logitech&#39;s wireless USB receiver as well, so that they&#39;ll work with almost any smartphone or computer — and let you flip easily between devices.</p><p>The wireless buds come with active noise cancellation (ANC) and a noise cancelling mic, allowing for high-quality sound on calls, Logitech claims. And unlike bulky wireless headsets designed for businesses (like Logitech&#39;s own <a href="https://www.logitech.com/en-ca/products/headsets/zone-wireless-bluetooth.html">Zone models</a>), they&#39;re designed to provide a &quot;stylish look&quot; when you&#39;re on a Zoom or other conference call. Logitech also promises &quot;double the battery life of leading consumer devices,&quot; though that&#39;s a meaningless statement without a figure to back it up.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bf9a7240-f416-11eb-beff-2e015ec78528" style="height:1320;width:1800;" alt="Logitech&#39;s latest wireless earbuds are certified by Zoom, Microsoft and Google" data-uuid="b50c6bf0-61a4-3094-b73f-c8ac1957af18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Logitech</div></figure><p>&quot;Current wireless solutions force consumers to compromise between either traditional headsets that are not aesthetically suited for video calling, or sub-optimal audio performance,&quot; said Logitech VP Scott Wharton. The audio quality remains to be heard and reviewed, of course, but they&#39;re certainly nicer looking than most business headsets.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the Zone True Wireless  model, Logitech also debuted the Zone Wired Earbuds &quot;for professionals and teams who want a professional-grade, plug-and-play option,&quot; the company said. They can connect to your computer or mobile device via USB-C, USB-A and 3.5mm connectors.</p><p>The Zone True Wireless Earbuds will be available in two colors, graphite and rose, but won&#39;t come cheap at $299. The Zone Wired Earbuds, meanwhile, run $99. Both arrive globally in the fall of 2021.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/logitechs-latest-wireless-earbuds-are-certified-by-zoom-microsoft-and-google-070127204.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">449df139-8e7f-4f10-88e9-504f081386ae</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 07:01:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627966698</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T04:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8bd992e0-f413-11eb-beda-9db53e52f42d" width="1800" height="1124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8bd992e0-f413-11eb-beda-9db53e52f42d" width="1800" height="1124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Logitech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logitech's latest wireless earbuds are certified by Zoom, Microsoft and Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Logitech's latest wireless earbuds are certified by Zoom, Microsoft and Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T finalizes spinoff of DirecTV into its own company]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DirecTV is now its own company again after AT&amp;T <a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/att_directv.html">closed</a> the deal with private equity firm TPG, which it first announced back in February. Under their agreement, TPG would own 30 percent of the spinoff, while the mobile giant will retain a 70 percent ownership. As its own company, DirecTV will no longer operate under AT&amp;T and will own and run the AT&amp;T TV and U-verse video services under a single brand known as &quot;<a href="https://www.directv.com/stream/">DirecTV Stream</a>&quot; debuting later this month. The new spinoff says customers won&#39;t even feel the transition: The streaming services will continue being available and subscribers won&#39;t be blindsided by hidden fees.</p><p>AT&amp;T received $7.1 billion in cash for the sale, which is but a tiny fraction of the $49 billion it originally paid when it purchased DirecTV in 2015. Back then, former AT&amp;T CEO Randall Stephenson <a href="https://about.att.com/story/att_completes_acquisition_of_directv.html">said</a> combining DirecTV with AT&amp;T &quot;is all about giving customers more choices for great video entertainment integrated with mobile and high-speed internet service.&quot; According to <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-08-02/directv-spinoff-att"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a>, AT&amp;T has lost 40 percent of the DirecTV&#39;s original subscriber number since then, and in the second quarter of 2021, DirecTV reported having 15.4 million premium video subscribers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The telecom giant has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-att-may-split-with-directv-satellite-unit.html">trying to offload</a> DirecTV since at least 2019, but it hasn&#39;t announced anything concrete until earlier this year. This deal doesn&#39;t include the HBO Max streaming service, which will be part of the company&#39;s separate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-spins-off-warner-media-in-a-merger-deal-with-discovery-123716979.html">WarnerMedia spinoff</a>. In May, AT&amp;T <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">announced</a> a $43 billion deal that would see its WarnerMedia division merge with Discovery. It&#39;s expected to close in mid-2022, four years after AT&amp;T finalized its $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner. Both that deal and this DirecTV spinoff will help AT&amp;T&#39;s debt reduction efforts. As <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/att-directv-spinoff-tpg-streaming-bundles-warnermedia-1234807615/"><em>Deadline</em></a> notes, it has taken several steps, including selling off assets, over the past few years to reduce the debts it has acquired due to its massive multimedia acquisitions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-direc-tv-spinoff-051610804.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a47458eb-8e13-4cd0-9b0e-04d172fa2804</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 05:31:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627966925</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T05:02:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f2612d70-f409-11eb-b7ff-2d09c60b5965" width="1200" height="794" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f2612d70-f409-11eb-b7ff-2d09c60b5965" width="1200" height="794" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DirecTV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon violated US labor laws in Alabama union vote, labor official rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) officer has recommended that workers at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama hold a new election because Amazon broke US labor laws, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/business/amazon-union-alabama-nlrb.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> has reported. It&#39;s still only a preliminary ruling, but provides hope that workers may still be able to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU).</p><p>Last April, worker&#39;s at the fulfillment center <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">voted against</a> unionization by a margin of more than two to one. Following the vote, however, the RWDSU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-retail-union-rwdsu-23-objections-election-tampering-allegation-143104913.html">alleged</a> that Amazon won because it “interfered” with the rights of its employees &quot;to vote in a free and fair election; a right protected under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The RWDSU filed 23 objections in total, including one complaint that Amazon had a ballot collection box installed in an employee parking lot “without authorization” from the NLRB’s regional director. It noted that the box was placed under the view of Amazon security cameras, creating &quot;an impression of surveillance.&quot;</p><p>The NLRB officer sided with the union, saying Amazon violated US labor laws. &quot;Throughout the NLRB hearing, we heard compelling evidence how Amazon tried to illegally interfere with and intimidate workers as they sought to exercise their right to form a union,&quot; said union president Stuart Appelbaum in a statement. &quot;We support the hearing officer’s recommendation that the NLRB set aside the election results and direct a new election.&quot;</p><p>Amazon, however, said it would dispute the decision and take steps to ensure that the initial vote held. &quot;Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers,” an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement. “Their voice should be heard above all else, and we plan to appeal to ensure that happens.”</p><p>The decision doesn&#39;t yet have any legal force until a full ruling is made by the NLRB&#39;s acting regional director, something that could take up to a month. During that time, parties will be able to file exceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the Bessemer vote, Amazon&#39;s situation has caught the attention of the Teamsters union, which created a special division to focus on organizing Amazon&#39;s delivery drivers. Amazon has been criticized for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apologizes-for-tweets-attacking-work-conditions-192622311.html">working conditions</a> of drivers and warehouse workers alike, along with its union-busting efforts that were exposed in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-union-labor-relations-settlement-alabama-141059373.html"><em>New York Times</em></a> report earlier this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-found-to-have-illegally-discouraged-union-organizing-in-alabama-035214235.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff73a7f4-df33-4f39-b2fd-01cc3683814a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 03:52:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627994242</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:37:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a7f1ea0-f457-11eb-b73b-11d09337941d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a7f1ea0-f457-11eb-b73b-11d09337941d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A worker pickets out front of an Amazon Fulfillment center.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1232002568 Amazon picket protest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter partners with Reuters and AP to boost curation efforts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/bringing-more-reliable-context-to-conversations-on-twitter">partnering with <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em></a> to help its curation team put credible information in front of users. Made up of employees who work together to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-moments-guidelines-and-principles">contextualize some of the most popular topics</a> people are discussing on Twitter, the curation team oversees some of the platform’s more visible and sometimes controversial features, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-explains-trending-topics-pinned-tweets-173023064.html">Trends</a> and the Explore tab.</p><p>As a Twitter user, the company says you can expect to see it work faster to ensure there’s more and better contextual information to see as people discuss things on the service. As a starting point on that front, the company says Trends will include contextual descriptions and links to reporting from reputable publications more frequently. Additionally, the company says the program will help it proactively identify topics that could become a wellspring of misinformation. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter also expects the partnership will help some features, where context is vitally important, work better. Here, the company points to tools like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-misinformation-182940288.html">Birdwatch</a>. Initially, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> will focus on helping the company with English-language content, but it’s worth noting the curation team contextualizes Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese content as well.</p><p>In trying to support its curation team better, Twitter wants to avoid a repeat of a situation like the one it found itself in last year following the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The social media network was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/2/21413001/twitter-trends-labels-representative-tweets-conspiracies-misinformation">overrun with conspiracy theories about Epstein’s suicide</a>, and the company was seemingly unable to stop hashtags like #ClintonBodyCount from trending. Even when you take blatant disinformation out of the picture, Twitter trends are frequently easy bait for trolling, as was on display when US gymnast Simone Biles <a href="https://warzel.substack.com/p/the-simon-biles-culture-war-traveled">withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics</a>. While trolls are likely to continue trying to game the service, enlisting the help of <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> could make those efforts less visible</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-associated-press-reuters-curation-partnership-213918911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21e19397-6bc4-42de-918e-29a601821f1e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 21:39:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627940363</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T21:39:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Men are silhouetted against a video screen with a Twitter logo as he poses with a Samsung S4 smartphone in this photo illustration taken in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, August 14, 2013.

Spotted by <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-announces-smart-soap-dispenser-that-can-automatically-trigger-alexa-routines/"><em>AFTVnews</em></a>, the gadget includes a set of 10 LED lights that will count down as you wash your hands for the 20 seconds recommended by the CDC to keep germs and harmful bacteria away.</p><p>As an Alexa Gadget, you can also pair the Smart Soap Dispenser with a compatible Echo device to access a supporting Alexa Routine that will play your favorite song or tell you a joke or fun fact while you scrub away. That’s an optional feature and the dispenser itself doesn’t include a microphone or speaker. You also don’t need an Echo device to access its best gimmick. Depending on how far underneath the nozzle you hold your hand, the device will provide you with more or less soap from its 12-ounce reservoir.

Amazon says the internal battery can last about three months on a single charge.</p><p>At $54.99, the Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is significantly more expensive than many of the “dumb” automatic soap dispensers you can buy, including a lot of the ones you’ll find on Amazon’s own marketplace. It also feels like it’s a year late.

The Containment event features a new game mode called Nest Destruction, in which you&#39;ll attempt to destroy or defend an alien nest on a revamped version of the Consulate map.</p><div id="b686d1166d594773b949837aef139a95"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEhzh2YY8C8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The attackers play as a team of REACT agents who are tasked with destroying nests. They&#39;ll square off against &quot;a team of Proteans, a deadly Archæan variant that can adopt the form of REACT operators,&quot; Ubisoft said. These creatures can mimic the behavior of operators and they&#39;ll move fast, but they can only use melee attacks, such as Aruni’s punch and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/oryx"><ins>Oryx’s</ins></a> special abilities. The attacking team can only use a standard loadout with no modifiers, and there&#39;s a limited roster of operators. Along with successfully destroying or defending the nest, teams can win by wiping out their opponents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The event sounds intriguing, but the timing of it is slightly odd. The mode was inspired by <em>R6 Extraction,</em> which was supposed to arrive in September. Last month, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-extraction-riders-republic-172418599.html"><ins>pushed back</ins></a> the release date to January. Still, Nest Destruction might give you a taste of the next game in the Rainbow Six series.</p><p>The Containment event will be available from August 3rd to August 24th. Between August 13th and 15th, <em>R6 Siege </em>will be free to play, so anyone can hop in and check out the event. Ubisoft will grant double bonus Battle Pass points during that weekend.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rainbow-six-siege-event-extraction-aliens-free-weekend-180523263.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a93d8e9a-d5e8-4d81-95fe-e0040e317f1a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 18:05:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627927527</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T18:05:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a6c2120-f3bb-11eb-beaf-b919fb1ece3c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a6c2120-f3bb-11eb-beaf-b919fb1ece3c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Containment event]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Siege Containment event]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony adds 'Nier: Automata,' 'Ghostrunner' and 'Undertale' to PlayStation Now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony is adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-13-how-nier-was-brought-back-from-the-dead.html"><em><ins>Nier: Automata</ins></em></a>, <em>Ghostrunner</em> and <em>Undertale </em>to its <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/02/playstation-now-games-for-august-nier-automata-ghostrunner-undertale/">PlayStation Now service</a>, the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/02/playstation-now-games-for-august-nier-automata-ghostrunner-undertale/"><ins>announced on Monday</ins></a>.

Even companies like Modal Electronics, which typically trafficked in higher-end instruments that started at around $2,000, suddenly felt pressure to compete in the sub-$300 range. First it dabbled with two simplistic DIY kits: the CraftSynth and CraftRhythms. But then in 2018 it brought the Skulpt to Kickstarter, followed shortly thereafter by the $149 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-modal-electronics-craftsynth-2-0-hands-on-demo-portable-music.html">CraftSynth 2.0</a>. These were much more serious shots at the entry level. But where both impressed with their sound, the build quality was poor and the original Skulpt was a little overpriced at $299.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-affordable-portable-synthesizer-mpe-100523052.html">SkulptSynth SE</a> attempts to address those concerns. It’s quite a bit cheaper at just <a href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">$199</a>, putting it more in line with the Volcas, and the build quality is sturdier, too. But under the hood it’s largely the same instrument, and the question is whether it’s as compelling now as it was three years ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alright, I won’t make you wait: The answer is yes. The Skulpt sounds great. Sure, plenty of other synths have come and gone over the last three years, especially at the cheaper end of the spectrum, but that doesn’t take away from the excellent virtual analog engine here. There’s a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices (though using the spread function you can expand that to 16) with two different waves per voice. This gives the Skulpt a thick tone that, while you probably won’t mistake it for true analog, is still plenty inviting. While it&#39;s perfectly capable of handling basslines and lead duty, the Skulpt really shines when it comes to pads where those stacked oscillators really flesh out the sound.</p><p>The Skulpt has a wealth of modulation options, too, that give it a surprising amount of depth for something so small and cheap. There are dedicated filter and amp envelopes, but also a mod envelope and a pair of LFOs, one of which is polyphonic. Those last three can be assigned to a host of different destinations, with a total of eight modulation slots available. In addition, there’s ring modulation, FM and pulse width modulation options, plus a morphing filter that goes from lowpass, to bandpass then highpass, not to mention built-in delay and distortion effects. There are far more sound design tools here than you’d have any right to expect for $200.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The wealth options are great, but actually navigating those controls is a bit difficult. The unit comes with a cheat sheet and you’ll always want it on hand. While the front plate has simpler, less confusing graphics than the original Skulpt, the SE still isn’t exactly intuitive. While there are lines that show you what controls are connected to each other, they’re not laid out in any sort of obviously logical way. And the tiny orange and white text labels feel crowded and hard to read at times. While the layout is visually interesting, it’s also infuriating. This a place where form clearly won out over function, and not for the better.</p><p>Another thing that’s improved on the SE is the build quality. But, just like the panel design, it’s not as huge an upgrade as you might hope. The knobs feel a little firmer and have slightly more resistance than on the Craft 2, but they’re still pretty wobbly and cheap. At least they don’t slide right off the encoders with a gentle tug, though.</p><div id="e32890c2287b4b83b55bc683b7b28c5e"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1098737245%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-B0LetHEZU7a&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-sound-samples/s-B0LetHEZU7a" title="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples</a></div></div><p>I’m not sure how much better the overall build is than the original Skulpt, and it’s only marginally better than the Craft 2. In general, the Skulpt SE still feels chintzy. But it does come with a cover that will help protect it in a bag, which is more than I can say for the Craft. Sadly, though, the touch keyboard is as bad as ever. It’s not always super responsive and the layout somehow manages to feel both cramped and sprawling all at the same time. Playing simple triads required an uncomfortable amount of stretching and I could rarely play a chord progression without accidentally triggering at least one stray note. Volca keyboards are certainly nothing to get excited about, but they make the Modal touchstrips feel like cheap imposters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db0a6f0-f3a4-11eb-9efc-9043541d6567" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="a5c9ec23-5bc7-38bd-a7d2-752d30e18809"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One final gripe about the physical design: The Skulpt has full-sized MIDI in and out ports, but a 3.5mm lineout jack. While full-size MIDI DINs are appreciated, I’d rather see ¼-inch audio outs and smaller TRS MIDI jacks if I had to choose. And honestly, on something that’s battery powered and portable, TRS MIDI just makes more sense. Save the space.</p><p>A lot of my complaints about the interface and unimpressive build quality can be ignored though if you just use the app. Stick the Skulpt someplace out of the way and connect it to your computer or phone over USB and you’re set. Then you can control it via MIDI over USB and do all your patching from within the Modal app. It’s much easier than using the device itself. It even has a VST version so you can control the Skulpt from your DAW, but I had some issues getting it running on my Windows PC.</p><section data-eng-breakout="19fd7110f0864e86ac1322de738befc1" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b027e4d0-f3a5-11eb-adfb-393619633cd2" alt="Modal App" data-uuid="04e7bad0-fb33-3f6c-9b6d-fc2a1a26c471"></section><p>The Skulpt is usable without the app, unlike the Craft 2. But honestly, this is probably the way you want to use the Skulpt anyway. While the whole battery-powered portable thing is nice, what’s more exciting is its support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mpe">MPE</a>, which is basically unheard of at this price point. But the built-in keys do not support MPE, velocity or aftertouch, you’ll need to use an external controller.</p><p>Having access to aftertouch and polyphonic expression gives the Skulpt much more life. As a digital synth trying to emulate analog it can sound a little cold at times, but the small fluctuations that come with aftertouch and MPE make the synth feel more organic. Just be warned that dialing in MPE controls requires a bit of trial and error (definitely turn down the pitch bend range in the settings).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daf9580-f3a4-11eb-a5f6-10c98ed41a79" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="37da4d89-4f42-3a2a-bbf8-1f822ecc40e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>This also gives you more room to experiment with your sound design in interesting ways. For example, in one patch I set the mod wheel (sliding your fingers along the Y axis on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-sensel-morph-trackpad-review.html">Sensel Morph</a>) to change the wave shape, and aftertouch to control the filter cutoff. Then I could play a chord and slowly slide my fingers up on the highernotes, causing them to fizzle out as the wave morphed from saw to noise, but keep the bass note droning cleanly. And then I could adjust the balance between these two sounds simply by pressing harder or softer on the right keys. This isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, but it’s definitely impressive on a synth that costs just $200.</p><p>This does make me dream of an upgraded CraftSynth, though. As much as I enjoy the Skulpt, I prefer the sonic palette of the wavetable-based Craft a bit more. I’d love to see Modal release a polyphonic version of it that supports MPE. Basically, give us the best of both synths in a single device.</p><section data-eng-breakout="11b589afc1914f54aaf0989fb5f6772a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daef940-f3a4-11eb-befc-05e1c86e1239" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="50503922-2ef0-3dbf-bd78-6049918c8dee"></section><p>There are so many options out there at the entry level for synths these days it’s hard to say there is one that is best for most people. The Skulpt SE certainly wouldn’t be a bad choice, though. If you’re truly just starting to learn synthesis, something more straightforward like the $150 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-11-korg-announces-volca-analog-synth-series-we-go-eyes-on.html">Volca Keys</a> might be a good option. But it doesn’t have the depth of the Skulpt. If you’re willing to spend a bit more, Arturia’s $350 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-v3-firmware-three-new-oscillators-noise-engineering-synthesizer-184459017.html">Microfreak</a> has even more sound design options to get lost in. Plus, it regularly gets new features and sounds. The only issue is it’s even more complicated than the Skulpt, though its controls are much easier to navigate.</p><p>The SkulptSynth SE shows that Modal is serious about playing at the entry level. The company has delivered an excellent sounding instrument with a wealth of features at an impressive price. If it ever figures out how to design an interface that doesn’t make you want to rip your hair out, Korg’s grip on the budget synth market may be in jeopardy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7be78ab-4193-40df-83b1-87569aee60ec</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 17:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627921846</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T16:30:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db11c20-f3a4-11eb-bfcc-694a073493c1" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db11c20-f3a4-11eb-bfcc-694a073493c1" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[8BitDo made a pair of affordable media remotes for the Xbox Series X/S]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Peripheral-maker 8BitDo is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-150053234.html">retro-inspired wireless controllers</a>, but for its latest release, the company has come out with a <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/media-remote-for-xbox/">pair of officially licensed media remotes</a> for the Xbox Series X, Series S and Xbox One. Spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605423/8bitdo-media-remote-xbox-series-x-s-one-black-white"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the two remotes cost <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$19.99" href="https://amzn.to/3jhIHJg">$19.99</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$24.99" href="https://amzn.to/3ljwFlu">$24.99</a>, with the more expensive model featuring an additional numpad.

It’s not a mic, but the effect is about the same. Google’s chief of hardware had just shown me a demo of the company’s latest feature: computational processing for video that will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>.

The chip is called Tensor, and it’s the first system-on-chip (SoC) designed by Google. The company has “been at this about five years,” he said, though CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a statement that Tensor “has been four years in the making and builds off of two decades of Google’s computing experience.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That software expertise is something Google has come to be known for. It led the way in computational photography <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-14-google-pixel-night-sight-launch-sample-photos-comparison.html">with its Night Sight mode for low light shots</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-11-google-duplex-ai-tough-questions-answers-now.html">weirded out</a> the world with how successfully its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-google-duplex-ai-phone-call.html">conversational AI Duplex</a> was able to mimic human speech — right down to the “ums and ahs.” Tensor both leverages Google’s machine learning prowess and enables the company to bring AI experiences to smartphones that it couldn’t before.</p><p>Holding a diet Coke in one hand and gesturing animatedly with the other, Osterloh threw around hyperbolic marketing language like “We’re transforming the computing experience” and “It’ll be what we consider to be a pretty dramatic transformation overall.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" alt="Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other." data-uuid="8088beeb-d9d8-3961-b9c9-9f34e121454a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>He’s alluding to Tensor enabling experiences that previous chips (the company’s mostly used Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors in its prior phones) couldn’t deliver. Things like being able to run multiple AI-intensive tasks simultaneously without a phone overheating, or having enough power to apply computational processing to videos as they’re being captured.</p><p>That belief in Tensor’s significance is part of why Google chose to announce it today ahead of the Pixel 6’s actual launch in the fall. The company isn’t giving away all the details about the processor yet, nor is it sharing specific information about its latest flagships now. But “there&#39;s a lot of new stuff here, and we wanted to make sure people had context,” Osterloh said. “We think it’s a really big change, so that’s why we want to start early.”</p><p>Plus, there’s an added benefit. “Information gets out,” Osterloh added. “Nowadays it’s like, stuff leaks.”</p><h2>A new chip design with AI infused</h2><p>Thanks to those leaks, though, we’ve heard plenty of rumors about Google’s efforts to make its <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html">own mobile processor for a while</a>, under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">code name Project Whitechapel</a>. While the company won’t publicly discuss code names, it’s clear that work on Tensor has been going on for a long time.</p><p>The chip’s name is an obvious nod to the company’s open-source platform for machine learning, TensorFlow, Osterloh said, and that should tell you how big a role AI plays in this processor. Though Google isn’t ready to share the full details about Tensor yet, Osterloh did explain that the SoC is an ARM chip designed around a TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit. The mobile chip was co-designed with Google’s AI researchers and the TPU is based on their larger versions in the company’s data centers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/266992b0-f284-11eb-bd19-aa5a81c1ac61" alt="A rendering of Google&#39;s Tensor mobile chip with words on it saying " data-uuid="7f6473b5-534f-39c9-9006-df79555438e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>It’s not just designed to speed up machine learning tasks on your phone, either. Osterloh said they’ve also redesigned the image signal processor, or ISP. Specifically, he said there are a “few points in the ISP where we can actually insert machine learning, which is new.”</p><p>Google also reconstructed the memory architecture to make it easier to access RAM, and allow for data manipulation while processing images. There are also a few places where Osterloh said they’ve directly encoded their image processing algorithms into the hardware. He says this allows Google to do “stuff that was previously impossible to do on standard SoCs,” though he didn’t share specific details on what Tensor now enables that previous SoCs couldn’t.</p><p>Of course, with this being Google’s first mobile chip, Osterloh concedes people might see the company as unproven. Though he did push back by saying, “I think people are pretty aware of Google’s overall capability.”</p><p>It’s natural to wonder if the company can compete in areas like power efficiency and heat management. Osterloh said they’ve designed Tensor to perform some tasks more power efficiently than previous processors they’ve used while staying within a thermal threshold. Similar to existing processors, Osterloh said “the system has a bunch of different subsystems, [and] we can use the most power efficient element of it for the task at hand.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/48a10890-f284-11eb-b597-5fa79b144805" alt="Side view of the peach/gold Pixel 6 Pro." data-uuid="73539ec3-e8f6-3e31-95e3-4c242eef56df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Though there’s an ongoing global chip shortage, Osterloh is confident that Google can manage demand. “Everyone’s affected by this, no doubt,” he said. “The positive thing about this is it’s under our control, we’re making this and we’re responsible for it. So we think we should be okay.”</p><h2>Why make Tensor?</h2><p>So what can Tensor do that other mobile processors can’t? Google is saving most of the juicy bits for the Pixel 6’s launch in the fall. But, it did offer two examples of areas that would see dramatic improvement: Photography and voice recognition (and processing). At our meeting, Osterloh showed off some demos of new Tensor-enabled features on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, which also gives us our first look at the phones. The handsets feature a distinctive new look and bright color options. They also have a horizontal camera bump that spans the width of the rear, which is “a very intentional part of the design,” Osterloh notes. &quot;We’ve really been known for photography, [so] we wanted to really emphasize this.”</p><p>Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves, but the promised photography improvements aren’t just from optical hardware. Tensor is behind some of it. With previous chips, the company kept running into limits when trying to improve photography on its phones. “These weren’t designed for machine learning, or AI, and certainly not designed to optimize for where Google’s headed,” he said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones. From left to right, their color schemes are black/black, green/blue and red/peach." data-uuid="21fe90d2-f119-3daa-a3c2-c853a4dee4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>So where is Google headed? Towards a world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">of “ambient computing,”</a> a vision that Osterloh and many of his colleagues have touted in the past. They see a future where all the devices and sensors we’re surrounded by can communicate with Google (sometimes via the Assistant) or the internet. But Osterloh knows that for most people, the most important device is still going to be the smartphone. “We see the mobile phone as the center of that.”</p><p>So when Google wanted to improve beyond the limits of contemporary processors, it had to do something different. “What we&#39;ve done in the past, when we encountered these kinds of engineering, constraints and technical constraints, is we take on the problem ourselves,” Osterloh said.</p><h2>Upgrading photo and video processing</h2><p>With Tensor, the Pixel 6 can do things like concurrently capture images from two sensors, with the main one recording at normal exposure and the wide-angle running at a much faster shutter speed. Osterloh said the system runs a number of different machine learning models in real time to help figure out stuff about the scene, like whether there’s a face and is the device moving or shaking. The Pixel 6 will then combine all that info and use it to process photos so that if you’re trying to capture a hyperactive puppy or toddler, you’ll be less likely to get a blurry shot.</p><p>Tensor will also let Google perform computationally intensive tasks while you’re shooting video. Osterloh said that in the past the company hasn’t been able to apply a lot of machine learning to video, since it would be too taxing for a phone processor. But “that all changes with Tensor,” he said. One thing they’ve been able to run is an HDRnet model on videos, which drastically improves quality in tricky situations like when the camera is pointing at the sun.</p><p>Osterloh showed me demos of how the Pixel 6 did both these things, including a before-and-after example of a blurry photo of an active child and video comparisons of a campground at sunset. While there was a clear difference, I unfortunately can’t show you the results. Besides, these were controlled demos from Google. I can’t really gauge how impressive and useful these features are until we get to test them in the real world.</p><h2>Improvements in voice and speech</h2><p>I did get to see a more telling preview, though. Osterloh also showed me how voice dictation will work in the Pixel 6 on GBoard. On the upcoming phone, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>This all works via a new Speech On Device API, and I was impressed that the system was smart enough to distinguish between when you say “Send” in “I will send the kids to school” versus when you’re telling it to send the message. Osterloh told me the algorithm is looking not just for the hotword but also your tone of voice and delivery before it triggers the action.</p><p>Finally, there are a couple more things that Osterloh showed me: Live Caption with Translate, as well as Android 12’s Material You design. Thanks to Tensor, Android’s Live Caption feature, which provides subtitles for anything playing through your device’s sound system, will be able to translate what’s being said in real time as well. This all happens on device, so the next time you’re watching a foreign-language TED Talk or your favorite international TV show, it won’t matter if they don’t have subtitles — Tensor will provide.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" alt="Android 12 Beta" data-uuid="1ff5cf9e-bbb9-30db-9806-e6ac39ca0e98"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><h2>A look at Material You</h2><p>Meanwhile, Material You, which Google first unveiled at I/O this year, is what Osterloh called the biggest UI change in Android maybe since the beginning. I’ve been waiting to see the feature in the Android 12 public beta, but it’s still not available there. At our meeting, Osterloh showed me how it works — he changed the wallpaper of a Pixel 6 from something more rosy hued to a scene of a body of water, and the system’s icons and highlights quickly updated to match. App icons were painted to match as well, but something new I learned from this demo was that if you’re like me and prefer your icons to keep their original colors, you can opt to leave them untouched.</p><p>We’ve gotten a really good look at what’s coming in the fall, though Google is still keeping plenty of details under wraps. We don’t know yet if it plans to say if it had help from other manufacturers in coming up with Tensor, and details about CPU and GPU cores, clock speeds and other components will be shared later this year. But with the new chip, Google’s been able to realize a years-long dream.</p><p>“We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75b90b61-1229-4618-88c8-85112803ae09</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627931663</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T19:14:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A rendering of Google's Tensor chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Tensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will use AI everywhere]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone launch season is typically in the fall, but Google has unexpectedly early news to share today. The company just announced that not only is the Pixel 6 coming this fall, but it’ll feature the very first system-on-chip designed by Google. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">chip is called Tensor and it leverages the company’s AI expertise</a> to enable more powerful and better integrated machine learning on devices. At a demo event to show off Tensor’s prowess, I was able to check out the Pixel 6 with the company’s chief of hardware Rick Osterloh. I wasn’t allowed to take pictures or video, and Google hasn’t shared all of the phones’ specs, but I can tell you about a few new features.</p><div id="bfc813bd2fe84b039480a23702b2a002"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1aDjlGNdiQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>First, there will be two lines: Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google hasn’t shared the actual dimensions yet, but the Pro, which is larger, felt similar in size to a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. They both look like <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/07/08/exclusive-full-final-specifications-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/">the leaked renders we’ve seen</a>, except shinier and three-dimensional. There’s a band about an inch tall on the rear in black, lime green or peachy red, and below that sits a horizontal camera bump that stretches across the case. According to Google&#39;s blog post, the sensors and lenses were improved and &quot;are now too big to fit into the traditional square.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, when you place the Pixel 6 on a table there’s still a slope because of the bar, but since it’s not off to a corner like on prior Pixels (or Galaxy phones or iPhones), the phone won’t wobble from side to side. The rest of the back is black, pastel green or pastel peach correspondingly.</p><p>For the Pro line, the colors are more subtle with less contrast between the sections, but they have what Osterloh called “high gloss metal accents” along the edges. The camera bump also gets this shiny treatment on the Pros, which come in black, white and sort of a light orange. The regular Pixel 6 has a matte finish on its sides. All the phones I saw appeared to have glass on their backs, with screens that are slightly curved along the edges. Google also moved the selfie camera from the top left corner to the middle of the display.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones. From left to right, their color schemes are black/black, green/blue and red/peach." data-uuid="21fe90d2-f119-3daa-a3c2-c853a4dee4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>I loved the peachy pastel version of the Pixel 6, though the mostly black version would suit those who prefer something less flashy. (Google doesn’t have names for the colors yet, though Osterloh said their marketing team has fun with them.)</p><p>More importantly, Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves. It’s not sharing specific megapixel or sensor size information yet, but did say these are sharper and larger sensors than before. Osterloh said the Pixel 6’s main camera will let in about 150% more light than previous Pixels. There’s also an ultrawide lens for both models, and the Pro gets an extra telephoto option as well with 4x optical zoom.</p><p>In addition to the actual camera hardware improvements, the Pixel 6s promise better photo processing thanks to Tensor. At our meeting, Osterloh highlighted changes coming in how Google will process images and videos for clearer, better exposed images of moving subjects. The company was also able to apply things like an HDRNet to video as it’s recording a scene to ease tricky situations like shooting a campsite with the phone pointed at the sun.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a661be0-f283-11eb-8ebf-11a88cc103bd" alt="A trio of Pixel 6 Pros. From left to right, their color schemes are: Black/black, Gold/yellow and Grey/silver." data-uuid="116553b4-3a08-320c-aea2-0cde70db847f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google also redesigned its speech software, with a new platform called SODA (Speech On Device API) that lets apps leverage Tensor for data-center-level speech recognition. Better yet, Osterloh said this all runs at half the power it used to on prior Pixels. He showed me a new Live Caption with Translate feature that subtitles all audio playing through your phone’s sound system. With Tensor, the device can both transcribe and translate what’s playing at the same (ish) time, without needing to use the cloud for processing.</p><p>Dictation is also getting some major upgrades. In GBoard on the Pixel 6, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>We don’t have all the details on CPU and GPU cores or clock speeds, RAM and battery life yet — those will come later. But Osterloh did say Google knows “users expect to get a day’s worth of battery life,” and that it’s aiming for that mark but to also “offer them a lot more capability in that period of time.” The devices will also support 5G, which “in the US means supporting all the different bands we have here,” Osterloh said. He declined to name any brands of 5G modems, though.</p><p>Though it’s not an official launch for the Pixel 6, this preview has shown us a lot. There will be new cameras, new design, new UI (in Android 12) and a new chip, among other things. Osterloh said he’s excited about the launch. “We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9027784a-8270-49e0-a68f-14a5282dec20</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627931721</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T19:15:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 ]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
