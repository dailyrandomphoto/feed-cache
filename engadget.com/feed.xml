The band and Epic Games are releasing <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> for free on November 18th for PS5, Windows PC and Mac. As you can see from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkqVeyhdLYI">trailer</a>, the finished project is just what you&#39;d expect — it&#39;s a trippy 3D art gallery that blends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-20-radiohead-public-library-and-rarities.html">Radiohead&#39;s music</a> from <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em> (including new sound design from Nigel Godrich) with the unsettling artwork of Thom Yorke and Stanley Donwood.</p><p>The exhibit was originally meant to be physical, but a combination of &quot;laws of zoning and physics and COVID-19&quot; (according to Epic) pushed it to the digital realm. Radiohead, Godrich and Donwood teamed with Namethemachine, Arbitrarily Good Productions, artist Sean Evans and theater set designer Christine Jones to create the exhibition. Epic is publishing the end result.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is clearly a plug for the <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> album that includes both albums and a string of previously unreleased material. At the same time, it might be worthwhile even if you&#39;re only casually familiar with Radiohead&#39;s tunes. This is a rare chance to explore a legendary group&#39;s music and imagery well beyond the usual confines of an album, and more on your own terms.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/radiohead-epic-kid-a-mnesia-virtual-exhibition-release-date-160006913.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079b4507-b336-43c3-af26-e3384673ac95</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636644147</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:22:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b04b620-42fd-11ec-b4ae-b11fad84d240" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b04b620-42fd-11ec-b4ae-b11fad84d240" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Namethemachine/Arbitrarily Good Productions/Epic Games/Radiohead]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Radiohead 'Kid A Mnesia' virtual exhibition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Radiohead 'Kid A Mnesia' virtual exhibition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox PC app will soon let you use mods and custom install folders]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much like <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/steam"><ins>Steam</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games%20store/"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-pc-app-remote-console-play-game-pass-cloud-gaming-153728842.html"><ins>Xbox PC app</ins></a> will soon let folks install games in any folder of their choosing. Xbox insiders (i.e. people who&#39;ve signed up to test new features) will be able to pick a default drive and folder for game installs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Microsoft Store hosts both games users can buy individually and Xbox Game Pass titles. Until now, all apps and games have shared a single install location. It&#39;s not uncommon for PC gamers to have more than one storage drive. They might use one as a boot drive and for day-to-day apps, and a solid state drive for games. So, after this update rolls out more broadly, installing games on a secondary drive should be a cinch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="1b1b31edda094dd6b367e00851b4cb6c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ea4-mxDSz6I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Insiders &quot;will also find that downloads of those games have improved over time, so it&#39;s even easier and faster to get to your next game,&quot; Jason Beaumont, Xbox&#39;s partner director of experiences, said in a video discussing the updates. What&#39;s more, players of many Xbox Game Pass titles will soon have access to local files, so they&#39;ll be able to install mods and move files. The Xbox app will show whether a game is moddable.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-update-gives-you-more-details-about-downloads-and-storage-122000978.html"><ins>Steam update</ins></a> released in September made it straightforward for players to move an installed game and all of its files to another drive.

Beaumont added that Microsoft is continuing to improve the app&#39;s performance, including &quot;making it more reliable to download and play your games.&quot; The team&#39;s also trying to make it easier for developers to add features like cross-saves and achievements.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-store-xbox-game-pass-update-install-folder-154724715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d3fb0e6-1212-4828-b382-3e55a63db2ca</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:47:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636645219</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:40:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ce81d1e0-4303-11ec-bbda-97b144a99fce" width="1155" height="665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ce81d1e0-4303-11ec-bbda-97b144a99fce" width="1155" height="665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Xbox app on Windows 10, including a tile promoting Forza Horizon 5.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Windows Xbox app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[All the 'fun' gifts our grown-up staff would like to receive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We at Engadget spend a lot of time thinking about the best tech gifts for anyone and everyone in your life.

When I was eventually given one, I spent hours doting on my virtual pet, doing my best to keep it alive and happy. Even now, a couple of decades and the addition of one cat later, there remains a soft spot in my heart for Bandai’s egg-shaped toy. Although I’d probably have less patience now for a beeping Tamagotchi in distress, I’d be overjoyed if someone dropped one onto my doorstep like a proverbial stork with a baby basket. Part of me wants to see how long I can keep the thing alive, and part of me wants to once again experience that childlike wonder inspired by a new toy that will, inevitably, suck up time that I don’t have to spare. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mp2nN7" id="d42f90e390a047308edded0afcf71e1a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Tamagotchi at Amazon - $20</a><h2>Dyson V11 Animal cordless vacuum</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3276ffb0-2ddb-11ec-8fbd-2b79a53aa66d" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="d7fe8e56-336c-3861-870d-9a0bf2dd0bb0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson </div></figure><p>One of the ways you know you’re a full-fledged adult is when a new vacuum excites you.

It is, without a doubt, the best vacuum I’ve ever owned even if it’s slightly less convenient than a robot vacuum that I can set and forget. The suction power is remarkable — it captures cat hair that I can’t even see around my apartment — and the various adapters that it comes with lets me clean my couch, cushions and even hard to reach areas like baseboards and room corners. It has three cleaning modes with various suction levels and battery lives, but I’ve never had to stop mid-cleaning to charge it.</p><p>But you may struggle to find the V11 Torque right now.

I run three to four times a week and strength train on top of that, and the Mini has helped work out knots in my hamstrings, calves, shoulders and (most importantly for me) lower back.

But now? I would be thrilled. As its name suggests, this is the company’s top of the line percussion massager with a rotating arm, a high-powered motor, two swappable batteries and a mobile app that lets you control speed. It also uses QuietForce technology to keep the noise level at a minimum and that should prevent you from waking anyone up while you’re using it.</p><p>The Pro gives you more control than the Mini does, not only with its companion app, but also in its ergonomic grip and the on-device buttons that let you adjust speed and force. Since I’ve never had a true massage in my life, I can’t say for certain if the Theragun Pro could replace that experience entirely — my guess is that it couldn’t, but it might get close. But if you’re someone who wants the instant gratification that comes from basically being your own masseuse, the Theragun Pro could help you get that. <em>— V.P.</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2ZPYBVi" id="e0fdf6e8e0264266a26fb0ca898bac19" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Theragun Pro at Amazon - $599</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-toys-for-grown-ups-153008549.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f5b4ab7-623d-4cf5-92a8-1283398ac342</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636575102</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T20:12:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e8ae6c20-3810-11ec-bfd6-a095929af60c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e8ae6c20-3810-11ec-bfd6-a095929af60c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images (background)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A collage of adult tech toys.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adult tech toys]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="d8145031a38b46308e873788d4cdd520"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8stAGJFBz0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The ProArt line of creator-oriented devices was a stroke of marketing genius by ASUS, helping separate them from rivals with a line of premium devices. A prime example is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-oled-notebooks-proart-zenbook-vivobook-160009335.html">Studiobook 16 OLED H5600 laptop</a>, tempting artists with high performance, a beautiful 16-inch 4K OLED display, and an “ASUS dial” for video or photo editing.</p><p>ASUS’s previous ProArt laptops like the StudioBook One were workstation-like creator devices with expensive parts like NVIDIA Quadro 6000 GPUs. With this model, ASUS is focusing more on bang-for-the buck with components like an RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 eight-core CPU. (The more expensive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:StudioBook 16 Pro" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">StudioBook 16 Pro</a> models offer Xeon processors and Quadro GPUs.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The question is, can a reasonably priced laptop like this keep up with more expensive models or even high-end gaming laptops when it comes to performance? To find out, I got a hold of a well-specced but modestly priced Studiobook 16 OLED model and put it to work on some photo and video editing jobs.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5c977582-7e9e-4c34-a794-a198f15b01cc"/><p>A key feature of all the Studiobook devices is the businesslike looks that are far away from ASUS’s gaming designs. To that end, it has a basic black, square-edged body with the only noticeable design touch being the subtle ProArt logo on top. It has bezels that are reasonably small but not what I’d call thin, and isn’t the lightest or smallest 16-inch laptop out there. Still, with a .77-inch thickness and 5.28 pound heft, it’s relatively compact — especially considering that it offers “military-grade durability” (MIL-STD 810H), according to ASUS.</p><p>ASUS has developed an “IceCool Pro” thermal solution that’s supposed to boost airflow by up to 16 percent, while keeping noise levels below 40 dbA in standard cooling mode. It does that through the use of dual 102-blade fans, six heat pipes and multiple ducts.</p><p>If you need more punch, you can switch to performance mode which boosts power to 95 watts, or up to 135 watts in “full-speed” mode. Fan noise is still reasonable in performance mode unless you’re doing GPU/CPU intensive chores, but the full-speed setting can get very loud indeed. Still, it could be a handy mode if you’re planning to leave the room while doing a render. Overall, heat and noise are very well managed.</p><p>The headline feature on this laptop is the 3,480 x 2,400 16:10 OLED display, the first on a 16-inch laptop, ASUS claims. As you’d expect, it’s sharp, vibrant and beautiful in person — by far the best laptop display I’ve ever seen in terms of fidelity and “wow” factor.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04dfdc50-4241-11ec-bfff-96ac54a6957d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="4e23971a-03e8-3e33-adda-d789a9ce9a7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The panel is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, with a delta E of less than two, a fact that I confirmed with my X-Rite i1 Display Pro calibrator. I used it with a $4,000 ASUS mini-LED ProArt monitor and despite the display technology differences, they matched very closely to my eyes, color wise.</p><p>The true 10-bit panel offers 100 percent DCI-P3 color coverage, in workstation laptop territory and well beyond rivals like the MacBook Pro (78 percent) and Dell’s XPS 15 (85 percent). Along with the color accuracy, that allows for precise color correction controls in apps like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Lightroom Classic. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky OLED blacks also makes it ideal for content creation, with a side benefit that it’s the best entertainment laptop I’ve ever used.</p><p>Given that the display is suitable for color correction, ASUS should have perhaps included a way to easily change the color profile for video editing ( Rec.709, DCI-P3 and so on) or photos (AdobeRGB, sRGB). That could be a handy setting in the Creator Hub, for example, or at least as an .icm profile for Windows Color Management.</p><p>You can crank the brightness up to 550 nits in HDR mode, so it conforms to VESA’s DisplayHDR <a href="https://displayhdr.org/#tab-true-black-500">True Black 500</a> standard for OLED displays — very bright indeed for a laptop display. However, it’s well short of the 1,600 nits peak brightness available on the latest MacBook Pros, which use mini-LED displays. That raises the question of whether OLED or mini-LED is more desirable on a creator laptop, but personally, I’d take the superior OLED blacks over eye-scorching brightness and haloing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cb1bd0-4241-11ec-a776-ac799f77b799" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="adae389f-a276-36c5-be1b-92cc798b4ba2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The other attention-grabbing feature is the ProArt Dial. I wouldn’t blame you for thinking it’s a gimmick, as it takes up space and adds complexity. Also, similar control surfaces can look cool but often end up in drawers, never to be used.</p><p>This one has a few things in its favor, though. It feels nice thanks to the textured grip, smooth rotation and clicky detents. Mainly, though, it’s just convenient as it’s located directly below the keyboard. In that way, it makes more sense than something like Microsoft’s Surface Dial or an external <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-10-palette-video-editing-controls-hands-on.html">control surface</a>, as those are usually placed outside easy grabbing distance.</p><p>With no apps loaded, you can use the dial to turn up the sound or increase monitor brightness more easily than using the function keys. To make the most of it, though, you really need Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. With Photoshop open, pressing the dial launches a dedicated pie chart-like menu with “slices” for brush options, layer zoom, and so on. Pressing it again on the brush menu, for instance, opens sub-options for hardness, flow, opacity and more. Premiere and After Effects have similar custom menus.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04caf4c1-4241-11ec-ba59-871681a7807c" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="94ca8ad6-7681-331d-9e20-2d010ee888f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If the stock menus won’t do, you can go into the ASUS ProArt Creator Hub software. There, you can reprogram the functions the way you’d prefer via drop-down menus. As it stands now, the dial only supports four Adobe apps: Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects and Lightroom Classic. As someone who uses other apps, particularly DaVinci Resolve, I’m hoping ASUS will add more down the road.</p><p>I’ve used control surfaces in the past as part of my former video editor career, but I haven’t been a big fan of them on PCs. However, after trying the ASUS dial with Photoshop and Premiere Pro, I got used to it pretty fast. It was natural to keep one hand on the keyboard and the other on the dial to jog video, swap tools and so on. Before long, it was second nature and sped up my workflow.</p><p>Moving to the front of the laptop, the trackpad is smooth, responsive and sports not just two, but three buttons — taking me back to the 2000s when all PC mice had this. The third one adds an extra control that could be useful for 3D or CAD apps, video editing to mark “in” points and so on. It’s also the first laptop touchpad from ASUS that supports styluses using the MPP 1.51 standard, which includes its own. That allows artists to use the touchpad as a precise drawing tablet. I wasn’t able to make use of this functionality myself (I can’t really draw), but it’s nice to have it there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b32-4241-11ec-b96b-ee865275a588" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d44f6703-5900-327a-b305-201ac0acfdbc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard has decent travel and a nice amount of spring back, and offers a separate number pad that’s nice to have. However, the entire keyboard is shifted upwards more than usual and the keys are perhaps a touch small, because the ASUS dial effectively increases the space between the touchpad and keyboard. I got used to it pretty quickly, though, and it was never bothersome.</p><p>Port-wise, it’s well-equipped with two fast USB-C 3.2 gen2 10Gbps connections, two USB-A 3.2 gen 2, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack and RJ45 ethernet. The HDMI 2.1 jack is nice, as it allows you to connect, say, a supported TV and get 4K at up to 120 fps. It’s good that one of the USB-C ports supports DisplayPort, because a lot of monitors only work with that standard. However, given that creators often connect tons of gadgets, I would have liked to see an extra USB-A port or two, though.</p><p>It’s nice that ASUS incorporated a bleeding edge SD Express card slot that can read data from supported cards at an awesome 985 MB/s. There’s a rather huge problem, though. If you insert an SD UHS II card used by tons of cameras, the StudioBook will only read it at UHS-I speeds — 100 MB/s instead of 300 MB/s. Since no cameras support SD Express yet, I’d rather have seen a standard UHS-II slot. (Hopefully that will change, as Sony, Nikon and Canon are part of the SD Express consortium.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04b549e0-4241-11ec-aa6b-cad7c4674536" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="c6801961-64ec-3d2a-90ee-30afa69d2f6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For sound, ASUS incorporated an audiophile-grade ESS Sabre DAC, promising lower distortion and expanded dynamic range. There are only a pair of speakers rather than four or more like on some recent laptops. However, they’re well above average for a laptop like this, with decent mid-range sound and acceptable bottom end. Other features include a fingerprint reader on the power button along with a top-mounted IR HD webcam with Windows Hello support and a privacy shutter.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about performance. The top-end ProArt StudioBook OLED 16 I’m testing uses the RTX 3070 mobile GPU, rather than the top-end RTX 3080. I don’t have a problem with that, as an RTX 3080 wouldn’t speed up creative apps much and adds cost and heat. Everything else is high-end, though. It’s got AMD’s top mobile 8-core Ryzen 5900HX chip, 32GB of RAM, and two terabytes of NVME storage in Raid 0. It currently comes with Windows 10 Pro, but ASUS will offer Windows 11 upgrades early next year.</p><p>I ran the ProArt StudioBook through our usual battery of performance tests, including PCMark 10 for productivity, 3DMark’s Time Spy for 3D performance, Atto’s diskbench and others.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED H5600 (Ryzen 5900HX, NVIDIA RTX 3070)</p></td><td><p>6,954</p></td><td><p>4,604</p></td><td><p>1,499/9,053</p></td><td><p>5.61 GB/s / 5.35 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G15 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>6,881</p></td><td><p>4,530</p></td><td><p>1,426/7,267</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.85 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 Stealth (2021, Intel i7-10870H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,369</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247/6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s / 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gigabyte Aero 17 HDR XB (Intel i7-10875H, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,155</p></td><td><p>3,495</p></td><td><p>1,137/5,681</p></td><td><p>2.93 GB/s / 2.59 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus Duo 15 (Intel i9-10980HK, NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,616</p></td><td><p>3,680</p></td><td><p>1,365/8,055</p></td><td><p>3 GB/s / 3.24 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="" style="margin-bottom:10px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);">It performed near the top in all of them, as shown in the chart above, particularly the disk speeds. With the RAID 0 NVMe storage, disk speeds are stupendously fast, with reads at 5.6 GB/s and writes at 5.35 GB/s. It can’t be overstated how much that helps disk-intensive apps like Premiere Pro.</p><p>I also ran tests more geared to content creation, like Maxon&#39;s Cinebench R23 and Puget Systems’ <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/">PugetBench</a> for Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve. The PugetBench tests offer decent real-world results, as they automatically loop a series of functions that test effects, encoding, playback and so on. Again, I saw top-notch results compared to other recent creative and gaming laptops.</p><p>For instance, it hit 938 on the <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-DaVinci-Resolve-1523/">PugetBench DaVinci Resolve</a> extended overall test, a result that stacked up with many desktop machines. Other scores included a 981 on PugetBench Photoshop 22 CC, compared to 781 for the Dell XPS 15 OLED and 998 for Lenovo’s ThinkPad P15 Gen 2. Like most other laptops, though, it was handily bested by Apple’s M1 Max MacBook Pro, scoring 698 on the PugetBench Premiere Pro Standard test, compared to 821 for the MacBook.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cacdb0-4241-11ec-8ffb-107313e4fd0d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="89baf665-f6c8-31bd-91de-0e5c35e4e93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Gaming is not this laptop’s <em>raison d’être</em>, but I did some anyway, and it acquitted itself beautifully with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> and other titles. Frame rates were decent for 4K laptop gaming, though I needed to knock the detail settings well back. The 4K screen is a limiting factor, of course, because of the 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Synthetic benchmarks and gaming are fine, but creativity laptops need to prove themselves at work, too. To that end, I edited a camera review video for the laptop using DaVinci Resolve 17.2, and this video on the latest version of Premiere Pro. I also dipped into Photoshop, After Effects and Lightroom.</p><p>Again, the ProArt Studiobook acquitted itself with honors, offering fluid 4K editing, even with GPU-intensive camera codecs. I was able to export 4K videos at nearly 300 percent real-time speed in Resolve (NVIDIA encoder, MP4, 4K, 12,000 Kbps max data rate), with color correction, text and other light effects on nearly every shot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b30-4241-11ec-b75e-21677d6a7cb2" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d6948c7e-6955-3c6a-8500-ffd4cdcf8b3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a desktop-replacement laptop that will often run off wall power, the StudioBook has surprisingly good battery life. It ran for 6 hours and 20 minutes in our 1080p video loop rundown test and even longer for normal browsing and work chores — excellent considering the 4K display. The AMD Ryzen 9 chip’s efficiency likely helps a lot here.</p><p>That beats most 4K PC laptops, with the exception of Dell’s XPS 15 OLED model that could go over 9 hours between charges. However, it gets stomped by the $2,500 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, which lasted a ridiculous 16 hours and 34 minutes in our tests. Yes, that model has slightly lower screen resolution, but it lasted over 2.5 times longer.</p><p>The StudioBook 16 OLED was relatively quiet during all these chores as well, with the fan only kicking in on complex scenes or exports. Even then, it was considerably quieter than my Gigabyte Aero 15X laptop. If you need maximum rendering performance and don’t need to stay in the room, you can select the “full-speed” setting that cranks the fans to the maximum speed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff2421-4241-11ec-9fdd-b8427b984d60" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="7c4e1191-0346-3262-9f86-56f7aa3a5230"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>In the end, is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16</a> OLED laptop worth getting over rival creative models or a comparably equipped gaming laptop? Without a doubt.</p><p>It’s not just fast, but smooth and reliable across creative chores — and the “reliable” part is key for production-oriented laptops. It handles 4K editing and large photos without getting overly hot and noisy. It’s not even a bad gaming machine, though the 60Hz 4K screen isn’t ideal for that.</p><p>For the cost of the OLED model, you really get a lot. The model I’m working with will run around $3,000, though ASUS still hasn’t nailed down the final pricing yet. It also offers a better spec list than any rival creative laptops unless you’re willing to go way up in price. And don’t forget that the StudioBook has features not found on any laptop, creative or otherwise, like the 16-inch 4K OLED display and ProArt dial.</p><p>The MacBook Pro models with the M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs are making things more interesting for potential creative laptop buyers. They’re much more competitive than the Intel MacBook Pros, as they’re faster, quieter and have longer battery life. However, as Engadget has discovered in testing, the new MacBooks are better than PC laptops like the Studiobook 16 in some ways (battery and video playback) and worse in others (rendering, GPU performance in general). More on that soon in an upcoming Upscaled.</p><p>Still, for the money, the ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is the best Windows 10 content creation laptop you can get right now. I haven’t been excited about too many laptops lately, but I can’t recommend this model enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56911ecd-f0dc-44b5-ac88-c5585a977947</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636643338</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:09:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rittenhouse defense incorrectly claims iPad pinch-to-zoom modifies footage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lack of technical knowledge may have just influenced an important court case. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-video-zoom.html">reports</a> the defense for shooter Kyle Rittenhouse incorrectly claimed that an iPad&#39;s pinch-to-zoom function could modify footage of the incident, &quot;creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.&quot; That sparked a debate between lawyers and Judge Schroeder, who maintained the burden was on the prosecution to show the imagery remained in its &quot;virginal state,&quot; not on the defense to prove manipulation.</p><p>The judge may have accepted the argument.

And since it syncs with Google&#39;s companion app, it can use your phone&#39;s location to know when you&#39;re away, automatically entering an Eco Temperature mode to save energy. The app also lets you set schedules manually and make adjustments from anywhere — so if you want your home at a certain temperature when you get home from work, you can set that before you even start your commute.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nest Learning Thermostat has a few perks that the standard device doesn&#39;t have.

It also has a metal ring deals and comes with a trim plate, so it&#39;ll look sleeker on your wall. The actual display on the device is nicer, too — it&#39;s a high-res panel that can show the time, temperature and the weather as well, depending on the settings you choose. Overall, it&#39;s a capable device that can make controlling the temperature of your home easier while saving you some money on energy costs in the long run.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-learning-thermostat-is-28-percent-off-right-now-132656197.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03e9ea6f-9963-4566-a949-6dfc57d077e5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 13:26:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636637218</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T13:27:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/45bbcb60-4243-11ec-8bbf-f64ddb1225a2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/45bbcb60-4243-11ec-8bbf-f64ddb1225a2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Learning Thermostat]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Learning Thermostat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, one year on]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S debuted one year ago this month.

The software update comes with no change in hardware as HTC &quot;secretly built in the 6E required hardware from Day 1,&quot; tweeted HTC&#39;s global head of hardware products, Shen Ye.&nbsp;</p><div id="91d9e490f9974263a7cd093e10afdcf5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You also don&#39;t need new hardware. We secretly built in the 6E required hardware from day 1 😬. They&#39;re going through certification right now and we&#39;ll begin eabling as soon as they get approved.</p>— Shen Ye (@shen) <a href="https://twitter.com/shen/status/1458717100428574731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>WiFi 6E capability brings a &quot;wide range of benefits,&quot; according to Vive. That includes low latency and higher bandwidth for VR streaming with less WiFi interference. The wider frequency range also allows double the number of devices with their own dedicated channels. The headsets already had the hardware needed for the standard, &quot;so there&#39;s no added cost to the headset owner to leverage this functionality,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vive also introduced a feature called Location Based Entertainment (LBE) mode, designed for businesses that use the Focus 3 headset. It increases the size of the play area from a 15m x 15m space (225 square meters or 2,422 square feet) to 33m x 33m (1,089 square meters or 11,722 square feet). That&#39;s the size of four tennis courts, compared to a size just under a tennis court, the company noted.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af1a5040-42d4-11ec-af3f-4b2dfacdc80c" alt="Vive updates the Focus 3 headset with a much larger play area, WiFi 6e and more" data-uuid="53dde72d-f7b0-3978-a2a5-be4b986869d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>On top of the increased area, you can create a boundary in any custom shape like a polygon or L-shape. You&#39;ll only need to do that once, as the Focus 3 will &quot;constantly re-localize in the known play area.&quot; The new setting is designed to create large spaces for &quot;VR arcade, arena experiences or large training areas,&quot; according to HTC.&nbsp;</p><p>The update also includes Map Sharing, a feature that allows accurate co-location tracking among multiple users in a shared space. Other types of headsets that use outside-in tracking (rather than inside-out like the Focus 3), require &quot;users to carry a PCVR backpack and play in a limited space with the Lighthouse system,&quot; HTC notes. With the Focus 3, Map Sharing and LBE, &quot;users can finally run around in the field, provide cover for each other in shooting games or share their different perspectives in escape games,&quot; HTC said.</p><p>Other features include a Visual Odometery (VO) mode that lets you skip the usual 5-minute environment setup, an LBE Hybrid Mode that uses both VO and LBE for 6DoF tracking, and a Space Calibrator that allows accessories like a tennis racket to be more accurately tracked.

Now, the streaming giant has <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320">enabled</a> AV1 streaming on the PS4 Pro and a limited number of smart TV models. Netflix was a key contributor to the development of AV1, which is available for use royalty free under the Alliance of Open Media. It shared this list of supported TVs with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775150/netflix-av1-codec-tv-streaming-ps4-pro"><em>The Verge</em></a>:</p><ul><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 8K QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Frame 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Serif 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Terrace 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Any TV connected to a PS4 Pro streaming with the Netflix app</p></li><li><p>Select Amazon Fire TV devices with Fire OS 7 and above</p></li><li><p>Select Android TV devices with Android OS 10 and above</p></li></ul><p>The company explained that deployment on TVs took sometime because playback on TV platforms depend on hardware. It was only over the past year that the industry released models capable of AV1 streaming. Netflix conducted comparison testing before rollout and found that AV1 delivers videos with better quality than other codecs, especially when there&#39;s network congestion. It also noticed fewer noticeable drops in quality due to changing network conditions and lesser time to start streams. In addition, since AV1 has higher compression efficiency than the codecs Netflix is currently using, it needs lesser bandwidth.

The company has reportedly cut its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html">previous production forecast</a> of 16 million down to 15 million, putting its target of 14.8 million PS5 sales by March in jeopardy, if the report is accurate. It also makes a bad situation worse in terms of consumers being able to pick up a PS5 over the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony is supposedly having trouble with not just parts supply but shipping logistics as well, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources. The problems are due in part to uneven vaccine rollouts in nations where Sony builds chips, and shortages of essential parts like power chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation has affected other console makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lowers-its-switch-sales-forecast-due-to-global-chip-shortage-083924964.html">Nintendo</a> and even affected the launch of an entirely new console, Valve&#39;s Steam Deck — pushing the date back until some time in 2022. It&#39;s got to the point that publishers are reportedly saying that sales are gradually shifting over to PC versions of games due to a lack of consoles.</p><p>March is still a long ways off, so Sony might still be able to pull off the sales record goal. But it&#39;s rather ominous that this report is arriving just ahead of Christmas, so if you&#39;re looking for a PS5 as a gift and see an opportunity to get one, better snap it up quick.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-may-be-cutting-play-station-5-production-even-more-than-it-forecast-085009885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16e39f5f-6d27-4c98-a2fc-5d0ea7798f2f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636620611</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T08:50:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has stopped cropping image previews on the web, too]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After doing so on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-full-size-image-previews-now-available-ios-android-201809678.html">mobile</a>, Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965">stopped</a> automatically cropping images on the web, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775241/twitter-web-full-sized-images-no-crop-algorithm?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in its <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2021-earnings-results-webcast/">fourth quarter</a>, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers. That&#39;s in line with the company&#39;s already cautious estimate (in the &quot;low single-digit millions&quot;) and 60 percent more total customers than a year earlier, but well below what some analysts expected. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2021-earnings.html">noted</a> that StreetAccount predicted 9.4 million new users this quarter.</p><p>Disney&#39;s streaming-oriented Direct-to-Consumer division also lost $630 million (versus $374 million a year earlier) due in part to extra spending on production, marketing and &quot;technology costs.&quot; These were expected due to the growing service, but they suggest Disney+ isn&#39;t yet a net positive for Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html">two years after launch</a>. During an earnings call, company chief Bob Chapek was still confident the company would hit subscriber targets (over 230 million users by September 2024) and turn a profit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The media giant had warned of &quot;headwinds.&quot; While it didn&#39;t initially shed much light on the problems, we&#39;d note that Disney+ had a relatively quiet summer for shows, with series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html"><em>What If...?</em></a> and <em>Monsters at Work</em> shouldering the load. The company did stream two blockbuster movies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a>, but original films weren&#39;t a strong point.</p><p>Things are looking brighter for the fall. Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#39;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#39;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#39;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook&#39;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c64f6866-99a2-4f16-9885-ceaa571429d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636581449</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:57:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/06: In this photo illustration a Disney+ (Disney Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone screen.

In a complaint filed with the US District Court for Northern California, the agency claims Uber violated Title III of the <a href="https://adata.org/learn-about-ada"><ins>Americans with Disabilities Act</ins></a> (ADA) by implementing a policy that has seen the company charge “wait time” fees to passengers who, as a result of their disabilities, need more time to enter a car. The law prohibits discrimination of individuals with disabilities by private companies.</p><p>According to the Justice Department, the policy has been in place since 2016 when Uber implemented it in a number of US cities before eventually expanding its use nationwide. Anytime a passenger needs more than two minutes to enter an UberX car or more than five minutes in the case of an Uber Black or SUV vehicle, the company charges that individual a wait time fee. Uber contends most users pay, on average, less than $0.60 when that’s the case. However, passengers with disabilities, including those with wheelchairs and walkers, often need more time to enter a vehicle than those without.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division.</p><p>A spokesperson for Uber called the lawsuit “surprising” and “disappointing.” The full statement reads:</p><p><em>Wait time fees are charged to all riders to compensate drivers after two minutes of waiting, but were never intended for riders who are ready at their designated pickup location but need more time to get into the car. We recognize that many riders with disabilities depend on Uber for their transportation needs, which is why we had been in active discussions with the DOJ about how to address any concerns or confusion before this surprising and disappointing lawsuit. </em></p><p><em>It has been our policy to refund wait time fees for disabled riders whenever they alerted us that they were charged. After a recent change last week, now any rider who certifies they are disabled will have fees automatically waived. We fundamentally disagree that our policies violate the ADA and will keep improving our products to support everyone’s ability to easily move around their communities.</em></p><p>The company also pointed to the fact it does not, by default, charge a wait time fee when someone requests a wheelchair accessible or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-09-03-uberassist-and-uberaccess.html"><ins>Uber Assist</ins></a> ride. This isn’t the first time Uber has been sued for allegedly violating Title III of the ADA. In 2017, disability advocates in New York City <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-18-uber-sued-again-failing-disabled-passengers.html"><ins>filed a class action complaint</ins></a> against the company. At the time, the group said Uber was inaccessible to 99.9 percent of people with mobility disabilities.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/justice-department-uber-disability-lawsuit-214724043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">81b01eb8-bb9a-4124-808f-3564c74cf306</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:47:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636579232</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physical Disabilities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6031a890-9b9d-11eb-93bf-f9d0aa515883" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6031a890-9b9d-11eb-93bf-f9d0aa515883" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MOZCO Mateusz Szymanski via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Warsaw, Poland  - April 30, 2019: View on Uber car (Skoda) with inscription on the street before sunset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Uber car waiting for customer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch SpaceX launch its Crew-3 mission here at 9PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-crew-3-launch-date-delayed-191311158.html">a few delays</a>, SpaceX is finally (hopefully) ready to start its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-crew-3-launch-delay-175613942.html">Crew-3 mission</a>.

As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#39;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p><p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#39;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.&nbsp;</p><p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#39;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/congress-mandate-anti-drunk-driving-technology-cars-201820120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8936c47c-ccda-40c7-904f-02df1e7d2fe8</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636580871</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:47:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[3980290905 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve's Steam Deck won't ship until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712">delayed</a> the launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> by two months.

Both nations said they recognized a gap between current actions and the Paris agreement target of keeping that warming below 2C, and ideally no higher than 1.5C.</p><p>The exact terms weren&#39;t available as of this writing, but US climate envoy John Kerry said China committed to reducing methane emissions and coal use &quot;as fast as is achievable.&quot; China wouldn&#39;t, however, join a US-Europe initiative to cut methane emissions by a third no later than 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether or not this translates to meaningful action is far from clear. China has made some efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-baidu-teaming-with-geely-on-electric-vehicle-090704201.html">promote electric vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">reduce coal dependence</a>, but it&#39;s still the largest contributor to emissions and hasn&#39;t radically reduced its harmful output. It also hasn&#39;t had much of a presence at COP26, with President Xi Jinping declining to show up where US President Joe Biden was happy to attend.</p><p>The US isn&#39;t immune to problems, either. While the Biden administration has promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">halve greenhouse gas emissions</a> by 2030 and spur EV adoption, there&#39;s no guarantee it can pass legislation needed to honor its side of the pledge. That&#39;s also assuming the next White House doesn&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-20-trumps-plan-for-energy-independence-sacrifices-the-environment.html">undo previous environmental efforts</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s still rare to see the US and China agree on climate change issues, though, and the very existence of the pledge represents progress for China. The country hadn&#39;t previously acknowledged the impact of methane on global warming, for instance.

First, it will look at how the company can continue to support cryptocurrencies as a way for creators to be paid. Related to that, it will explore how blockchain technologies can create an additional way for creators to earn a living. Lastly, with help from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a>, it will lead the company’s efforts to decentralize social media.</p><p>“There’s massive and growing interest among creators to use decentralized apps to manage virtual goods and currencies – Tess will focus here, with a long term goal of exploring how ideas from crypto can help us push the boundaries of what’s possible with identity, community and more,” Twitter said.</p><p>It’s not a surprise to see Twitter get more serious about crypto.

Social network head Adam Mosseri has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803">revealed</a> that Instagram started testing its hinted-at &quot;Take a Break&quot; feature this week. Opt in and the app will remind you to do something else after 10, 20 or 30 minutes, whether it&#39;s a to-do list item or just listening to your favorite tune.</p><p>You&#39;ll see the option in the &quot;coming days&quot; if you&#39;re part of the test. Mosseri hoped to launch the feature for everyone in December. He stressed that Instagram would &quot;take feedback&quot; and refine the design, so you might not have to worry if it doesn&#39;t function as you&#39;d hoped.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There may already be room for improvement. Like a previous time limit feature, Take a Break doesn&#39;t strictly enforce the pauses. You can simply tap &quot;done&quot; and continue scrolling. You&#39;ll have to turn to digital health or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-how-to-manage-your-child-s-screen-time.html">parental control features</a> like iOS&#39; Screen Time or Android&#39;s Digital Wellbeing to force yourself or a child to do something else.</p><p>This is still an improvement, though, and may help if you just need a gentle reminder to put down your phone. Not that Instagram or its parent Meta have much choice. The company is under pressure from regulators and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, both of which have accused Meta of focusing too much on hooking users and not enough on caring for them.
