The developer has some good news for fans of the mind-bending adventure: there&#39;s much more <em>Control </em>on the way.</p><p>The studio and 505 Games agreed to co-publish and develop a multiplayer spin-off. <em>Condor</em> (which is a codename) is a co-op player vs. environment game. You&#39;ll be able to team up with three friends and tackle enemies — most likely controlled by the otherworldly force called the Hiss. <em>Condor </em>is being developed for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But that&#39;s not all. According to <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-signs-a-co-publishing-and-development-agreement-with-505-games-for-a-multiplayer-spin-off-game-of-the-award-winning-control/"><ins>a press release</ins></a>, Remedy and 505 have initial plans &quot;to further expand the Control franchise with a bigger-budget Control game, to be agreed in more detail in the future.&quot; So, it sure sounds like there&#39;s a proper <em>Control </em>sequel on the way too.</p><p>Don&#39;t expect to learn much more about those games anytime soon, though. &quot;It is going to be a long time before we show off these projects,&quot; Mikael Kasurinen, game director of the <em>Control</em> series <a href="https://www.remedygames.com/the-future-of-control-remedy-505-games/"><ins>said</ins></a>. However, &quot;there are other Remedy experiences coming from our studio that I know you will love.&quot; The studio is working on the single-player campaign for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crossfirex-remedy-entertainment-172425868.html"><em>CrossfireX</em></a>, which is slated to arrive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crossfirex-delayed-2021-223000436.html">this year</a>.</p><p><em>&quot;Control</em> is an extremely successful game,&quot; said Rami and Raffi Galante, the co-CEOs of 505&#39;s parent company Digital Bros Group. It has sold more than two million copies, and it&#39;s been a freebie on <a href="http://v/"><ins>PlayStation Plus</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-epic-games-store-free-game-161548396.html"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>.

Mark Zuckerberg announced the new project during a live audio room, saying that the project was a “response to what’s happening in the media ecosystem.”</p><p>Bulletin will host a mix of free and paid content. Some articles will be freely available, while others will be behind a paywall, with paid subscribers getting access to extra features like dedicated Facebook Groups or special badges. Like newsletter upstart Substack, Facebook is reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bulletin-june-201428131.html">paying</a> some writers upfront for their participation. Zuckerberg also said Facebook won’t take a cut of writers’ earnings (at least initially), and will give them the ability to take their content and subscriber lists with them to a different platform.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Interestingly, unlike previous journalism initiatives from Facebook, Bulletin primarily lives outside of the main Facebook app. The newsletter platform has its own website and branding, though it will take advantage of Facebook’s distribution tools. The newsletters will be integrated into author’s Facebook pages and readers can find the content in the news section of Facebook’s app. Authors will also have the ability to &quot;complement their writing&quot; with podcasts and audio rooms, Zuckerberg said.</p><p>The initial lineup of writers includes authors like Malcom Gladwell and Adam Grant, and faces from TV like former CNN White House correspondent Jessica Yellin and former ESPN correspondent Erin Andrews. For now, it’s not clear when Facebook will open up Bulletin beyond its initial slate of hand-picked writers. The company describes the program as a &quot;closed beta,&quot; but Zuckerberg said more writers would be coming onboard in &quot;the coming weeks.&quot; <em>Recode </em>previously <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22518571/facebook-substack-bulletin-newsletter-launch"><ins>reported</ins></a> that the company was eager to avoid the kind of  “political” writers that have caused some headaches for Substack.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bulletin-newsletters-180747141.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80cfacb9-cf10-4362-b0c4-6ad8b6bb809d</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:07:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624993228</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T19:00:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5dbf3580-9659-11eb-b7a7-e5fd5cc7f03e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5dbf3580-9659-11eb-b7a7-e5fd5cc7f03e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/04/04: In this photo illustration a Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

Sure, the swiveling screen is useful for following you around the room during video calls, but it also felt gimmicky and unnecessary. Plus, it needs a lot of room to move around so you’re losing a significant amount of counter space. That&#39;s why I’m glad the <a href="https://amzn.to/3xnC7Xe">Echo Show 8</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3iM7V3S">5</a> haven’t repeated that design. In fact, Amazon has changed very little between this edition and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-amazon-echo-show-8-lenovo-smart-display-7-review.html">the last</a>, but trust me when I say that’s a good thing.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="8f1a98a6-529d-4be8-a15f-a0aaa05f8e07"/><p>It’s the Echo Show 8 that has seen the most changes, but most of those are under the hood: It now has a faster octa-core processor plus a much-improved 13-megapixel wide-angle camera (the previous model only had a 1-megapixel sensor). Plus, the Echo Show 8 can follow you during video calls without the need for a swiveling display. Instead, it uses digital panning and zooming, the same tech you’ll find in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal devices" href="https://amzn.to/3jtRqK6">Facebook’s Portal devices</a> (plus the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 10" href="https://amzn.to/3w2KhDe">Echo Show 10</a>, when it’s not moving around).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This digital pan-and-zoom works well enough that I feel like there’s a cameraperson keeping my face in frame during video calls, tracking me as I move across my living room. This face-tracking feature works on every video calling platform that the Echo Show 8 supports, which includes Skype and Zoom, in addition to Amazon’s own services. (You can make video calls via the Alexa app or from Echo Show devices.) I found the video and audio quality to be generally quite good. That said, the auto-framing can be a touch glitchy; it sometimes takes a few seconds for it to kick in. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal" href="https://amzn.to/3628tek">Facebook’s Portal</a> does a comparatively better job at this sort of automatic tracking, with hardly any lag.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a019ad0-d591-11eb-aef7-e0257fe740bb" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="c2139f89-59f2-33d2-b7d3-c6a5537bfb3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Show 5, on the other hand, only brings minor changes. It now has a 2-megapixel camera, up from one megapixel, which is still pretty meager. And it comes in a light blue color in addition to the usual black or white. Its camera does not have the pan-and-zoom capabilities of the Echo Show 8, probably thanks to its significantly lower resolution. Notably, the Show 5 currently does not support Zoom. (Amazon has said that it’s working with Zoom to roll out support to more devices, so this could change.)</p><p>The rest of this review might seem like deja vu, as everything else here is very similar to previous generations. Both devices have the same minimalist design. The Echo Show 8 has a 1,280 x 800 resolution while the Show 5 settles for 960 x 480. Photos and video look good on both, though I do prefer watching videos on the Show 8 simply because the screen is bigger. Both the Echo Show 8 and 5 also have an ambient light sensor, which adjusts the screen’s brightness and color temperature according to their surroundings.</p><p>On top of both the Echo Show 8 and 5 are volume controls, a microphone mute button, plus a camera shutter for privacy. The Show 8 has a better sound system than its smaller sibling, with two speakers instead of one. It delivers surprisingly powerful bass and impressive volume, easily filling my small office. The audio from the Show 5 isn’t too bad for its size, but it just doesn’t sound as good. I should note that both the new Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 5 lack the 3.5mm headphone jack featured on their respective predecessors, which means you can’t attach them to larger speakers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1d51b3c0-d591-11eb-befb-87d4f83eaae8" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="68b4297a-dbbd-3240-bedf-3ca0d30c9839"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Both the Echo Show 8 and 5 have a sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens up the display to mimic daylight’s arrival. However, the Show 5 is the only one that lets you tap the top to snooze. This is likely because Amazon is marketing the Show 5 as an alarm clock designed to be on your nightstand, while the Show 8 is meant more for the living room or the kitchen.</p><p>Like the new Echo Show 10, the two smart displays have Amazon’s updated home screen, which features multiple cards that let you view several topics at once, such as weather and sports next to each other. It’s contextual to the time of day as well; I saw the latest headlines during the day, for example, while at night I noticed a suggestion for a relaxing songs playlist. I like this mix of rotating screens a lot; it’s one reason why smart displays are a lot more useful than, say, a smart speaker. You can get a glance of information passively, without having to actively ask for it.</p><p>Using the Show 8 on my computer desk is a treat as well; it’s great as a digital photo frame and it displays the current time and weather conditions as well. I also found it useful in the kitchen, since it has access to a large library of recipes from sources like <em>Food Network</em> and <em>Allrecipes</em>; I can say “Alexa, how do I make chicken noodle soup?” to bring up a list of relevant results. All of the recipes have step-by-step cooking directions; some even have accompanying photos and videos for additional guidance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/578bb540-d591-11eb-97d5-2503b1925bba" alt="Amazon Echo Show 5" data-uuid="51bf0d27-5eff-310b-9900-489c4beff4fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Show 5 fits better on my bedside table. Of course, it works just fine in other areas of the home as well, but its smaller size makes it best suited as an alarm clock. That said, I’m not entirely comfortable with having devices with cameras in the bedroom (even if there is a privacy lens cover). One of the reasons I think <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google&#x002019;s Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4NbA">Google’s Nest Hub</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Lenovo&#x002019;s Smart Clock" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Kexbmv">Lenovo’s Smart Clock</a> make for ideal alarm clocks is that they don’t have cameras at all, which helps allay at least some privacy concerns.</p><p>As with other Amazon smart displays, the latest Echo Shows support video streaming from Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu. YouTube isn’t supported natively, though you can still access it via the built-in Silk browser. It’s definitely not as integrated of an experience as you get on Google’s smart displays. Additionally, there’s no support for Disney+, Paramount+ or HBO Max, all of which are available on Google’s smart displays.</p><p>The Echo Show 8 and 5 offer easy access to smart home controls, which you can use to adjust the temperature of your smart thermostat, control Philips Hue lights and more. As you might expect, these Echo Show displays are especially useful if you’re a frequent Amazon shopper. Adding items to your shopping cart is as easy as telling Alexa to do so. Plus, it shows a reminder when a Subscribe &amp; Save order is about to ship, which helps avoid surprise packages.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/718974a0-d591-11eb-adfb-3160cf0ccb0c" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="dbe3e9b2-eee0-3ca3-a0d4-07164d89344e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I didn’t get a chance to test it, but it’s also worth noting that the Echo Show 5 is available in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kids Edition" href="https://amzn.to/3jnlcAc">Kids Edition</a>, which comes with a year’s subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus. It features a child-friendly home screen and a two-year guarantee against damage. Also important: It lets parents control the content and features children have access to.</p><p>The closest competition to both Amazon smart displays is Google’s second-generation <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Nest Hub" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4NbA">Nest Hub</a>, which has a 7-inch display. It retails for $100 — a little cheaper than the Echo Show 8 ($130) and a little pricier than the Echo Show 5 ($85), but it also offers slightly different features. The Nest Hub is better for those who prefer Google Assistant to Alexa, and it also offers more video streaming options. I also tend to prefer the Google smart display software, as it’s more visually appealing and intuitive than Amazon’s. It doesn’t have a camera so you’ll miss out on video calls and the speaker system isn’t as good.</p><p>Fundamentally, however, it’s not the hardware that will dictate which smart display you buy as much as which tech giant’s ecosystem you want to be a part of. If you already have Nest home devices and you want YouTube integration, you’re much better off with a Nest Hub. But if you’re already an Alexa user, an Echo Show would be a better option.</p><p>As for which Echo Show you should pick, the Echo Show 8 delivers the most value for the money. Compared with the Echo Show 5, it has a bigger display and superior audio, which is more than worth the extra $45. And it has the same auto-framing camera as the much more expensive Echo Show 10 (even if it lacks the rotating display). If, however, you don’t care much about video calls, and prefer one that doubles as an alarm clock, the smaller Echo Show 5 could be the better bet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc6fe934-b3eb-454b-acab-902e3838bdd6</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624988180</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T17:36:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/fc1d5600-d590-11eb-b7cd-3342a5ad8df6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ae6e1930-d590-11eb-bf2f-30b307c6eb37" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8 and 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8 and 5 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Automakers must report crashes involving self-driving and driver-assist systems]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has implemented a new policy that will require car companies to report incidents involving semi- and fully autonomous driving systems within one day of learning of an accident.

The order covers Level 2 advanced driver-assistance systems to Level 5 fully autonomous vehicles, meaning it includes the gamut of everything from Tesla cars with Autopilot to Waymo taxis.</p><p>&quot;This action will enable NHTSA to collect information necessary for the agency to play its role in keeping Americans safe on the roadways, even as the technology deployed on the nation&#39;s roads continues to evolve,&quot; the regulator said. NHTSA said it would also require automakers to send in monthly reports detailing all incidents with injuries or property damage involving their automated driving systems. Companies that fail to comply with the order could face fines of up to $22,992 per day, according to <em>The Post</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NHTSA&#39;s order comes some two months after a 2019 Tesla Model S was involved in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/fatal-tesla-crash-driverless-200259765.html">high-profile crash</a>&nbsp;where investigators initially said there was no one behind the car&#39;s wheel.

Mere weeks ahead of that incident, Robert Sumwalt, the chair of the NTSB, sent a letter to NHTSA in which he called on the agency to implement stricter regulation related to automated vehicle technology. NHTSA &quot;must act&quot; to &quot;develop a strong safety foundation,&quot; he said, citing Tesla frequently in his letter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-automated-driving-system-crash-report-174552853.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6f11abf-f8b1-4030-905c-8d04652124d5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:45:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624988100</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T17:35:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transport Accident]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/1e88d580-3edd-11ea-8a57-ce70dbfb73e6" width="640" height="480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/1e88d580-3edd-11ea-8a57-ce70dbfb73e6" width="640" height="480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla sedan is shown after it struck a parked Laguna Beach Police Department vehicle in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. in this May 29, 2018 handout photo.

The idea of Lenovo, makers of the <em>ThinkPad</em>, building a gaming machine worthy of comment feels a little weird, and yet the Legion 5 Pro is just that. The Walmart-exclusive model that I’m testing costs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:$1,530" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=buyersguide2021&amp;subId3=Review-LenovoLegion5Pro&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-0-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H-16GB-512GB-NVMe-TLC-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-Windows-10-Home-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645%3F">$1,530</a>, pairing AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H with NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 graphics. Powerful and affordable? That’s almost revolutionary.</p><p>Rounding out that spec list is 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Mercifully, both components are user upgradeable. That piddly drive will barely hold more than a couple Calls worth of Duty before you’re reaching for an external drive. But these are the sort of smart compromises that Lenovo opted for to keep the price down, letting you add more RAM and storage as needed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And then there’s the screen, a 16-inch, 165Hz QHD, X-Rite Pantone-validated IPS display with the new, taller 16:10 aspect ratio. At 500 nits, the panel can hold its own in bright light compared to many of its rivals, and the matte screen reduces the risk of glare. Watching 4K video on this thing is a very pleasant experience and I’ve enjoyed working from this device the past week or so that I’ve been using it. It certainly makes you want to spend hours at a time staring at gigapixel images of, say, Paris, which I definitely didn’t spend a long time doing this week (cough).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/71c29860-d033-11eb-b1ff-2179554a64f8" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="74eb9322-25d4-320c-ab73-f1879138b56f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Lenovo wasn’t looking to pull up any trees with this design, which is little more than a refinement of what went before. It’s not as thin or light as its rivals, and looks better in a dark room lit only by the glow of an RGB keyboard and the odd Nanoleaf panel. But if you’re buying it as a desktop replacement that’ll spend 90 percent of its time plonked on the same desk, it’s fine. Oh, and the aluminum chassis is rock solid, giving you confidence on those occasions when you do need to take it somewhere. That matte gray paint job, while very business forward, hides a multitude of palm sweat-based sins, but will attract every speck of dust in a three-mile zone.</p><p>The Legion 5 Pro’s chunky chassis also means that you’ll find an excellent supply of I/O running around its deck. You get four USB-A (3.2 Gen 1) sockets, two USB-C (3.2 Gen 2) connections, HDMI, Ethernet and a 3.5mm headphone / microphone jack, as well as the proprietary power port. On the right-hand side, you’ll also find a hardware camera mute button, which replaces the dedicated hardware shutter from previous versions.</p><p>Even after several days of use, using Lenovo’s TrueStrike keyboard remains a pleasant but weird experience. The keys have a depth of 1.5mm, but Lenovo uses “soft landing” switches to make each actuation feel a little deeper than that. Every time you hit a key, you’re expecting the hard jerk of a mechanical keyboard, only to find a pillowy end and bounce back up. It’s like filling your shoes with water on a hot day and then stepping into them: It’s very useful, but your brain is telling you that something’s amiss here.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that Lenovo took advantage of the Legion 5’s bigger deck size to include a numerical keypad. The company says that the numpad itself is full size, but to my eyes and fingers, it feels a little squashed compared to a regular external PC keyboard. The RGB backlighting is perhaps appropriately muted, but can be set to four different lighting zones when required. The trackpad, meanwhile, is perfectly functional, and the bigger size is welcome given how tight previous models have been.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cbd7b00-d043-11eb-82f3-505dc835ee91" alt="Bad image from a bad webcam." data-uuid="5a54619a-162e-3caf-bdc0-5c067e723120"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I have less to say about the machine’s 720p camera, which is the very definition of serviceable. Light blooms, everything’s uncomfortably fuzzy and the overall effect is that of most ‘60s TV shows when they’d get the Vaseline-smeared lens for close-ups. If you’re looking to make a living from streaming, or you’re a professional Zoom-call-haver, buy an external device. Poor webcam aside, Lenovo gets props for offering a dedicated camera disconnect button since there wasn’t room in the space-starved lid for its customary shutter.</p><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lenovo Legion 5 Pro 16 (AMD Ryzen 7 5800H 3.2GHz, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 8GB, 140Watt TDP)</p></td><td><p>6,871</p></td><td><p>4,899</p></td><td><p>1,411 / 7,416</p></td><td><p>3.19 GB/s // 2.54 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, AMD Radeon RX 6800M)</p></td><td><p>6,992</p></td><td><p>5,189</p></td><td><p>1,457 / 7,691</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s // 1.5 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Surface Laptop 4 15 (AMD Ryzen 7 &quot;Surface Edition&#39; 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Radeon Graphics)</p></td><td><p>6,620</p></td><td><p>512</p></td><td><p>1,048 / 6,551</p></td><td><p>1.9 GB/s // 985 MB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 (2021) (Intel Core i7-10870H, 16GB RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA RTX 3080)</p></td><td><p>5,639</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247 / 6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s // 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Benchmarks don’t tell the whole story, but the Legion 5 Pro comes in close enough to machines priced a couple hundred bucks more. When playing demanding AAA games like <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em>, I got between 50 and 60fps with the settings appropriately tweaked. Naturally, you’ll lose a little bit of that when you enable ray tracing, but it can handle hard work relatively well. The Legion 5 Pro has three pre-set performance modes which can be set inside the Vantage utility, or cycled through when you hit Fn+Q. One neat addition is that the power button will change color depending on which mode you’re in: Auto offers a white glow, Quiet a cool blue, and Performance an angry red.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p>Using a machine like this for general productivity work is a bit like taking an F-150 to buy a box of cereal, but it’s more than possible. After all, if all you’re doing is crunching documents, writing term papers, poking at spreadsheets and using Slack, this has more than enough. When transcoding a 28.2GB UHD H.265 video file to 1080p, Handbrake was able to crunch through it at over 40 fps, making it sturdy enough for even halfway professional video editors.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"></p><p>The Legion 5 Pro uses a dual-fan system which pushes hot air out of its chassis through a quartet of exhausts. Two vents at the back are complemented by one on each side, and if you’re not blessed with huge amounts of room, beware. Leave your hand, mouse, gamepad or drink next to one of those vents for too long and they will become uncomfortably warm. Playing <em>Cyberpunk</em> and <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> was kicking out enough heat that I wondered if I could make s’mores.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/aa17d450-d033-11eb-bfee-4bd37a3b4d63" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021) " data-uuid="c9827c05-370d-38bb-8723-688c7de66195"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">This problem is exacerbated with the aluminum underside of the chassis which gets too hot to touch. After a couple hours of gaming, I picked up the machine to move it somewhere else and damn: I thought I’d pulled a baking sheet straight out of the oven. It’s not hot enough to burn you, but it’s not something you wanna touch if you value not being in pain.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">It’s also impossible to sugarcoat the sheer noise that this machine makes when the fans spin up. This thing is noisy — noisy enough that you’ll need to dial your speakers up to drown it out or grab a pair of headphones to claw back some of that immersion. This is an occupational hazard of gaming laptops, but it’s worth noting that this system is loud.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Another tick in the “not ideal” column is battery life, and despite packing an 80WHr battery, it will not last long when removed from an outlet. Our standard battery rundown test loops a video until the computer dies, with the brightness set to 65 percent and all battery-saving tech disabled. It managed to last for four hours and 43 minutes while using the integrated Radeon graphics, which is <em>fine</em> in the gritted-teeth sense of the word. Certainly, while you can handle a few emails or some light browsing while sat on your couch, this is not a device you can take away from a socket for a full working day without fuss.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">One of the reasons that the Legion 5 Pro is compelling despite some of its flaws is its price, which is something. Lenovo has managed to undercut several of its competitors here, and there’s no wonder it’s only intermittently on sale right now. If you want a machine from Alienware with similar specs (the romantically-named <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-ryzen-edition-r5-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r5-laptop/wnm15ryzr5eufvs">M15 Ryzen Edition R5 Gaming Laptop</a>) it’ll cost you $1,900. For that, you’ll get a Ryzen R7 5800H (same as here), RTX 3070 with 8GB RAM (same as here), 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD (same as… you get the idea).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/914108c0-d033-11eb-8fff-4a0a3aae23f3" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="d930fa19-792c-37ec-9958-0f7897b72dbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">If getting RTX 3070 graphics is a dealbreaker, you could opt for the <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Blade-15/RZ09-0369BE22-R3U1">Razer Blade 15 Base Model</a> with a 15.6-inch FHD display, 10th-generation Intel Core i7-10750H CPU, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. You will, however, have to pay $2,000 for the privilege, which may be a non-starter for some. ASUS also offers the ROG Strix G15 — an all-AMD version of which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-review-amd-radeon-rx-6000m-120031416.html">we reviewed a few weeks back</a> — with an RTX 3070, priced at <a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202102AM190000003/A17602-ASUS-ROG-Strix-G15-%282021%29-Gaming-Laptop%2C-15.6%E2%80%9D-300Hz-IPS-Type-FHD-Display%2C-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070%2C-AMD-Ryzen-R9-5900HX%2C-16GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-PCIe-NVMe-SSD%2C-RGB-Keyboard%2C-Windows-10%2C-G513QR-ES96">$1,800</a>. If you were looking for a machine in that $1,500-or-so bracket, you could get the $1,600 <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-laptops/Razer-Book/RZ09-03571EM1-R3U1">Razer Book</a>, with a Core i7-1165G7 processor and Intel Iris Xe graphics. Alternatively, for $1,500 <a href="https://store.acer.com/en-us/predator-triton-300-se-laptop-pt314-51s-71uu">Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE</a> packs a Core i7-11375H CPU and NVIDIA’s RTX 3060 GPU, which seems like a fairly reasonable deal all things considered.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">Despite all of the chaos that has so far made up the current decade, we’re seeing a new dawn of AMD’s high-<em>er</em> end chips winding up in gaming laptops. This Ryzen 7 5800H can beat (select) Intel chips in a number of benchmarks, and you can expect to see it crop up in a number of other machines across this year. And while wealthier buyers may be tempted by a far pricier machine with RTX 3080 graphics, the 3070 here shouldn’t make you feel like a second-class citizen.</p><p dir="ltr" style="margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">There is lots to like about this machine, although the snips made to push the price down are sure to rankle some. The battery life is well below par, the thermals could do with refinement, and the webcam would look retrograde on even a five-year-old machine. But, if you’re going to stick this on a desk, keep it constantly plugged in to power and never do more than the odd Zoom, does any of that matter?&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">321ef4d1-8372-4043-b728-046e55cc8de8</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:29:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624994714</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T19:25:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon picks up the rights to star-studded podcast 'SmartLess']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Wondery will air the <em>SmartLess </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/podcast"><ins>podcast</ins></a> one week before episodes hit other audio platforms, starting on August 1st.

It&#39;s also making them easier to find by bundling them together in Nest&#39;s new <a href="https://safety.google/nest/">Safety Center</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the updates, Google says that all Nest devices released since 2019 are validated using third-party, industry-recognized security standards, including those developed by the Internet of Secure Things Alliance. It&#39;s also added a bit about its Nest bug bounty program that compensates security researchers who unearth vulnerabilities in its tech.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the revised precautions now mention how it keeps your Google Account secure with tools like two-step verification. While it promises future safeguards through a pledge to provide at least five years of security updates for Nest devices after launch. Plus, there are explicit references to its verified boot feature that checks a device is running the right software each time it restarts. Finally, Google also directs you to the device activity page that shows all the gadgets your Google Account is signed into.</p><p>Back when Google first made the commitments, it seemed as though the privacy hoopla over smart home tech was at a fever pitch. A damaging <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-11-amazon-alexa-voice-recording-human-review.html"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report had just detailed how Amazon hired contractors to transcribe Alexa recordings. Facebook — which was still reeling from the Cambridge Analytica scandal — had launched its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">Portal</a> display to mixed reviews, including valid questions over its place in the home. While Google had faced its own backlash for putting a mic in its Nest security hub and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-20-google-nest-secure-mic-forgot.html">not telling anyone about it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Amazon&#39;s internet-sharing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sidewalk-echo-default-214620200.html">Sidewalk</a> feature for Echo and Ring devices have kept data-sharing concerns in the spotlight. Therefore, you can&#39;t blame Google for promoting its privacy commitments in this sensitive environment. Especially, If it makes the difference between people choosing to buy its products over its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-privacy-updates-170006062.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b7c4f54-06ed-466c-823d-a7d6dfef1b90</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624972836</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T13:20:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11007e80-d8d9-11eb-a6af-a17d385ca156" width="675" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11007e80-d8d9-11eb-a6af-a17d385ca156" width="675" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nest Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nest Hub]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch BTS get distracted by a dancing Boston Dynamics robot dog]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/boston%20dynamics">Boston Dynamics&#39;</a> robots can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32wDFCM7iSI">boogie</a>.

Your account needs to have either been verified by the company or have passed the 10,000 follower milestone. Only then can you include a swipe-up link in your Stories. But in what could be a dramatic change for Instagram, it’s trying something different. The company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>it recently started a test that gives a small subset of its users the ability to link to a website using a Stories sticker.</p><p>Whether the platform eventually allows everyone to share links in this way is up in the air. For now, Vishal Shah, Instagram’s head of product, told <em>The Verge </em>the goal is to track the types of links people post, as well as to ensure they don’t use the feature to push spam and misinformation. The company’s hope is to eventually transition to stickers as the primary way people access websites outside of the platform. “That is the sort of future system we would like to get to,” Shah told the outlet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whatever direction Instagram ends up going with this latest test, as of recently the company has been experimenting with some significant changes to how its platform works. It was not too long ago it seemed Instagram would never allow people to post content from their computers, but that changed last week when it began a test <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tests-desktop-posting-162209909.html"><ins>allowing some users to do just that</ins></a>.

Most machines ship with a 720p or 1080p snapper, meaning you have to purchase a separate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-webcams-123047068.html">webcam</a> if you want higher quality video — or resort to using a compatible <a href="https://www.engadget.com/insta360-one-r-webcam-mode-image-quality-update-191434779.html">action cam</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/webcam-dslr-mirrorless-camera-140011166.html">DSLR</a>, if you own one. Well, now you have another 4K webcam to choose from to spruce up those video calls, virtual events or livestreams. Dell is releasing the $200 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Dell;elmt:viglink;pdid:UltraSharp Webcam" href="https://bit.ly/35Zdbtp">UltraSharp Webcam</a> that&#39;s capable of recording 4K footage at up to 30 frames per second.</p><p>Like the similarly priced Razer <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Kiyo Pro" href="https://fave.co/3qL6CVb">Kiyo Pro</a>, Dell&#39;s 8.3 megapixel camera also features a Sony Starvis sensor (only this one is 4K) normally used in surveillance cams.

You can choose between three preset fields of view: The default 90-degree shot to show more of your background, a 78-degree view that moves slightly closer to you and a 65-degree narrow angle for close-ups of your face.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also 5x digital zoom and an AI auto framing feature that keeps you centered in the frame even when you move around.

Plus, you can magnetically attach the cap behind the webcam so you don&#39;t misplace it. Dell&#39;s camera is also certified for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-new-modern-devices-webcam-130013990.html">Microsoft Teams</a> and Zoom, which means it&#39;s been tested to prove it plays nice with those video chat services.

Your young ones won&#39;t always have to wait for you, in other words.</p><p>You&#39;ll need a Kids+ subscription to use the Sidekick, although you&#39;ll at least have your choice of books. Over 700 titles will be available for kids aged 6 to 9, and Amazon is promising &quot;hundreds more&quot; every month.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Appropriately, Amazon is simultaneously rolling out Alexa Voice Profiles for Kids.

Not everyone will have Voice Profiles for Kids right away, but they should be available to everyone by July 2nd.</p><p>Before you ask: yes, Amazon is aware that parents and teachers should be involved in reading whenever possible. It&#39;s not suggesting that you use a smart speaker as a substitute for reading at bedtime. Reading Sidekick is meant to fill in the gaps and encourage kids to read aloud more often — you don&#39;t have to worry quite so much if a business trip keeps you away from home.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-reading-sidekick-140006613.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c50525e8-9a46-4891-b83c-5336dcdec5be</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624980970</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T15:36:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Parenting]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e5a4480-d8dc-11eb-a6ff-2492753b53b7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e5a4480-d8dc-11eb-a6ff-2492753b53b7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Alexa Reading Sidekick with Echo Dot speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Alexa Reading Sidekick with Echo Dot speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP's Pavilion Aero is its lightest consumer laptop yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP" href="https://fave.co/3dqqC9P">HP</a> has unveiled the Pavilion Aero 13, which is the company&#39;s lightest consumer laptop yet.

No-go areas include stadiums and sporting events; airports; security sensitive locations such as military airbases, national landmarks and critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants; and even temporarily restricted sites that may be out of bounds because of an emergency (such as a wildfire). Having an app in your pocket that gives you that info in real-time is obviously an important resource.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With a green light from the FAA, Wing says you can also use OpenSky to quickly request authorization to fly in controlled airspace, including areas surrounding US airports.

Now, LG has <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/">announced</a> that it&#39;s rolling out a firmware update that unlocks Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on its latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:2021 C1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Jrq7Be">2021 C1</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:G1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjD7E6">G1</a> series OLED models.&nbsp;</p><p>We knew that LG&#39;s high-end G1 and mainstream C1 series should be capable of 120 Hz 4K gaming with Dolby Vision, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdqCY9PEmKk">HDTV Test&#39;s Vincent Teoh</a> pointed out recently. However, Xbox Series X owners have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/mxt38a/dolby_vision_gaming_at_4k_120hz/">reporting</a> that those models weren&#39;t working, with an error message that &quot;your TV setup doesn&#39;t support Dolby Vision at 4K 120 Hz.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG told Teoh at the time that it was testing the functionality and working to bring it to market, and now it has done so with the firmware version 03.15.27. That makes the C1 and G1 series OLED TV models &quot;the first in the world capable of supporting Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on compatible platforms,&quot; the company said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/36f71d10-d8ca-11eb-86df-e5acac4e3a20" alt="LG&#39;s latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming" data-uuid="88c530f2-247a-39d4-bb97-ecbaebe1e2e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>In addition, it&#39;s testing the feature on other 2021 models including the OLED Z1 series, QNED Mini LED QNED99 series and NanoCell NANO99 series, all slated to receive the update in July. &quot;Additional 2021 and 2020 TV models are also being tested for Dolby Vision gaming in either 60Hz or 120Hz,&quot; the company added. There&#39;s no word on whether its 2019 OLED models, some of which also support both 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision, will be updated.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if you have an Xbox Series X or S console and 2021 LG G1 or S1 series TV, you&#39;ll be able to make the error message go away. However, you still won&#39;t be able to play any 4K 120Hz Dolby Vision games, because none exist at the moment. When they do eventually arrive, you should see not only more fluid playback, but brighter images, improved contrast and more vibrant, saturated colors — much as you do on Dolby Vision-encoded films and TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with that feature, the new firmware also introduces the Game Dashboard (shown above), a floating menu that helps LG owners optimize settings. It works on any any 2021 LG TV with Game Optimizer, letting users switch between genres (standard, FPS, RPG or RTS). You&#39;ll also be able to see the status of modes like black stabilizer, low latency and variable refresh rate. The new update is now rolling out, so if you own a supported set, you should gain access to all of those features soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-tvs-120-hz-dolby-vision-gaming-114549499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23007136-5514-4a09-821a-d30da0093388</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969324</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:22:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon launches a vinyl of the month club]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How can Samsung make its smartwatches as successful as the Apple Watch?

This will be crucial in helping Samsung turn a corner with its smartwatches. According to the latest figures from IDC, it remains a contender, but the Apple Watch still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-watch-and-air-pods-are-dominating-the-wearable-market-123044790.html https://www.engadget.com/...">dominates</a> the wrists of smartwatch buyers.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html">YouTube TV now supports 4K streaming, but it comes at a price</a></h2><h3>A new 4K Plus plan adds at least $10 to your YouTube TV subscription.</h3><p></p><p>Finally, starting today, YouTube TV will have a new add-on called 4K Plus.

The basic YouTube TV package can stream on three devices simultaneously. Unfortunately, this all comes at a fairly steep cost. The 4K Plus add-on costs $19.99 per month, on top of whatever your existing YouTube TV plan costs. (Right now, the basic YouTube TV plan starts at $64.99 a month.) That said, if you act quickly, you can get a price deal on 4K Plus — YouTube is offering a one-month free trial to new users, after which you can sign up for $9.99 per month, a pretty good deal over the standard price.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html"><strong> Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html">&#39;Dune&#39; release gets pushed back again</a></h2><h3>Warner Bros. plans to release it simultaneously on HBO Max and theaters.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0b043a11-d8c7-11eb-bbf7-41345ab912d9" style="height:404;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="56b600e0-e088-39a2-ba59-8833ec4968ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure></a><p>If you&#39;ve been waiting impatiently to see Denis Villeneuve&#39;s much-anticipated take on<em> Dune</em>, you&#39;ll have to keep on waiting.

Financial details have not been disclosed.&nbsp;</p><p>The move sees Sony Interactive Entertainment further bolstering its in-house gaming roster after previously snapping up Ratchet and Clank developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html">Insomniac Games</a> in 2019. Before that, it acquired <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> developer Guerilla Games — whose former head Hermen Hulst is now the chief of PlayStation Studios — and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-02-sony-acquires-infamous-dev-sucker-punch-productions.html">Sucker Punch</a>, the studio behind the critically acclaimed Japanese period epic <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the addition of Housemarque, Sony Interactive Entertainment now has 13 companies under its PlayStation Studios banner. The deal should help it to go toe-to-toe with Microsoft, which recently completed a massive acquisition itself by snagging <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-zenimax-acquisition-approved-eu-us-regulators-105057960.html">Bethesda&#39;s parent ZeniMax for $750 billion</a> in order to beef up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-bethesda-game-pass-exclusives-roundtable-phil-spencer-184648938.html">Xbox Game Pass</a> subscription service.&nbsp;</p><div id="fd2f0d26d5be4357a64c2bd20e55774d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thrilled to announce <a href="https://twitter.com/Housemarque?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Housemarque</a> has officially joined PlayStation Studios!

Sony said that the studio&#39;s day-to-day operations will continue to be run by its current management team with input from PlayStation Studios personnel.</p><p>“Housemarque has flexed its creative palette on a wide range of PlayStation games over the years that have continually showcased the power of our hardware,” said Jim Ryan, president and CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment. “The addition of Housemarque to PlayStation Studios reiterates our commitment to elevating the best development teams in the industry and delivering new experiences that can only be found on the PlayStation platform.”</p><p>“After more than 15 years of successfully collaborating, we’re excited to amplify our potential even further and join PlayStation Studios,” said Ilari Kuittinen, co-founder and managing director, Housemarque. “<em>Returnal </em>is a testament to our strong relationship with PlayStation Studios and the organization believing in us to take a risk and give us the freedom to explore our creativity and develop something unique. We can’t wait to bring PlayStation fans more fresh, new experiences.”</p><p>The deal also makes sense based on Sony&#39;s long-standing collaborative relationship with Housemarque. Several of the studio&#39;s biggest games were PlayStation console exclusives, including <em>Resogun</em>, <em>Alienation</em>, <em>Nex Machina</em> and <em>Matterfall</em>. It will now be tasked with repeating that success under the PlayStation Studios banner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3bdefe4b-6e6a-4327-831c-28d93a55c929</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:41:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624964977</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T11:09:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's new support website will help you locate local US food banks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has launched a new website called <a href="https://findfoodsupport.withgoogle.com/">Find Food Support</a>, which puts important resources on how to locate free and affordable food in the US in one place. Perhaps the most useful feature the website can offer is a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-rolling-out-maps-improvements-to-the-benefit-of-drivers-and-pedestrians-alike-183243714.html">Google Maps</a> tool that can point you to the nearest food bank, food pantry or school lunch program pickup site.&nbsp;</p><p>As the tech giant explains, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated hunger for people around the world. According to <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/National%20Projections%20Brief_3.9.2021_0.pdf">Feeding America</a> (PDF), 45 million people in the US alone had no reliable access to affordable food last year, including children who lost access to school lunches. That&#39;s a 30 percent increase from 2019. The non-profit has a slightly better forecast for 2021, but it still believes 42 million people in the country — 13 million of which are children, and 1 in 5 of which are Black individuals — may experience food insecurity this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google worked with No Kid Hungry, FoodFinder and the US Department of Agriculture to add 90,000 places with free food support across 50 states on Maps. The company said it will add more locations in the future. To use the tool, you only have to go to the website, whether on a PC or on mobile, and type in your location. It will then show you the nearest food banks and pantries with their addresses, phone numbers, and the days and hours they&#39;re operational.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/83b06a80-d8b1-11eb-bbff-ddda03c058a4" style="height:942;width:733;" alt="Google" data-uuid="be40e211-db15-3f4f-b44f-c3070fda7281"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Find Food Support also houses YouTube videos showing how food insecurity affects people from all walks of life. The hope is to destigmatize food insecurity, since the stigma associated with getting help prevents people from seeking groups and organizations that can assist them in their time of need. In addition, the website contains links to food support hotlines, benefit guides per state and information for specific demographics and communities, such as seniors, families and children and military families. And in case you don&#39;t need food aid and want to help out, you can also find information on how you can donate food, time or money on the website.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-find-food-support-website-100012251.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74e55bef-4088-4b88-96f3-7a416cf57f35</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624957565</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T09:06:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nikon's Z FC mirrorless camera recalls the glory days of 35mm film]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nikon is taking a trip back to its glory days of 35mm film photography with its second Z-series APS-C (DX) mirrorless camera, <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/0629_mirrorless_01.htm">the Z FC</a>. Designed to evoke the company&#39;s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM2">FM2 SLR</a> from the &#39;80s, it offers generous manual controls, including dedicated dials for shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. The decidedly retro look might also appeal to folks looking at stylish models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-fujifilm-x-t30-review.html">Fujifilm</a> and others.</p><p>Unlike Fujifilm&#39;s models, however, the Z FC has a standalone mode dial, so you won&#39;t set modes by combining settings from the ISO, shutter or aperture dials. It has a d-pad type control at the back, but (like the Z50) lacks a dedicated joystick.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/25d82640-d8a8-11eb-bded-16faa5b5abf9" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="47e357d0-369a-3f79-bf76-9504adf3147c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>The Z FC (presumably the FC stands for film camera?) isn&#39;t just about the looks and handling, though. It uses Nikon&#39;s Z mount system and shares the 20.9-megapixel sensor, Expeed 6 processor and other features with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-nikon-z50-camera-review.html">Nikon&#39;s Z50</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it adds a fully-articulating OLED (rather than LCD) display, and a significantly faster USB-C socket for transfers, charging and director power. Other physical features include a 2.36 million-dot electronic viewfinder, single SD card slot, microphone port (no headphone port) and an EN-EL25 battery that delivers up to 300 shots on a charge.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/368d0910-d8a8-11eb-bcfe-0641aab8ed2e" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="d1010e81-9968-31ac-b8d0-218d4ecd0ead"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Like the Z50, it can shoot at 11 fps with autofocus and auto-exposure enabled, with object, face and eye-tracking. However, it now lets you combine face and eye-tracking with a wide focus mode, expanding where the camera looks for a subject.&nbsp;</p><p>You can shoot oversampled 4K video using the full sensor width, and the Z FC introduces full-time eye autofocus mode while shooting video. That, combined with the fully-articulating sensor, will make the Z FC much more useful for vlogging and shooting selfies than the Z50.&nbsp;</p><p>To best take advantage of the small size and retro looks, Nikon also introduced the Nikkor Z 28mm f/2.8 (SE). It&#39;s relatively small and has a good field of view for tourist or street photography, and also offers a pleasantly retro look.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z FC arrives in late July at $960 for the body only, $1,100 with the DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR kit lens or $1,200 with the new 28mm F.2.8 (SE) lens. The latter will also be sold separately for $300, but it won&#39;t arrive until the fall.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fd9f9a0-d8a8-11eb-a757-81896a2e75e8" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="17f1e74b-66ba-36a6-b200-df935c7828cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-fc-apsc-camera-retro-chic-071315225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d5d72b3-5c8e-41e2-810e-89126d0b4736</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:13:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969476</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Nikon Z FC camera seen from head on.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nikon Z FC]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
