It later followed it up with the more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-5g-testing-endless-edge-snapdragon-765g-130047105.html"><ins>affordable and compelling Edge</ins></a>. The company&#39;s newest phone, <a href="https://www.motorola.com/blog/post?id=298">announced today</a>, falls somewhere in between those two devices. It’s not quite a flagship, but nor is it entirely a mid-range device either. Internally, the 2021 Edge features up to 8GB of RAM, up to 256GB of internal storage and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-6nm-chip-150029217.html"><ins>Snapdragon 778G</ins></a> processor.</p><p>That’s a step down from the Snapdragon 865 Motorola included with the Edge Plus, but what the 2021 Edge has going for it over its predecessors is a 6.8-inch display with a 144Hz refresh rate panel. Both the 2020 Edge and Edge Plus were limited to 90Hz, which should make the new model feel more responsive even with its mid-range processor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6c21bbc0-0134-11ec-85df-dd2263d9817d" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Motorola Edge" data-uuid="579c5f15-c3d9-317b-b85c-403d3ee61518"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Motorola</div></figure><p>Motorola also reworked the camera module on the 2021 Edge. The phone now features a primary 108-megapixel sensor that uses pixel-binning technology to improve performance in low-light situations. Supporting the main camera is an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with a lens that features a 119-degree field of view. Rounding out the camera array is a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, there’s a 32-megapixel shooter that can also take advantage of pixel binning.</p><p>The 2021 Edge comes with support for a variety of global LTE and sub-6GHz bands. It also comes with WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 and NFC connectivity, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html"><ins>C-band support</ins></a>, which will come in handy as Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) and AT&amp;T use the spectrum in their ongoing 5G build-outs. Speaking of Verizon, the carrier plans to offer a mmWave model later in the year.</p><p>Powering everything is a 5,000mAh battery Motorola says should provide up to two days of uptime. On the software front, the phone will ship with Android 11 and the company’s My UX skin. Motorola plans to support the phone with two major platform updates and two years of bi-monthly security patches.</p><p>What you won’t find on the 2021 Edge is support for wireless charging or robust waterproofing. It’s only IP52-certified. Most high-end phones these days feature either IP67 or IP68 water resistance.</p><p>Like it did with the Edge, the company plans to sell the 2021 model at a $200 discount for a “limited time.” Motorola hasn’t said how long the phone would cost $500. Pre-orders for the unlocked model open on August 23rd, with general availability to follow on September 2nd. Verizon and Spectrum Wireless will start selling the phone at a later date.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-2021-refresh-214747509.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9317111-3b46-4e7a-9385-bf654beed004</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 21:47:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629409962</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T21:52:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f94373f0-0133-11ec-adee-3b3c8c35843e" width="691" height="432" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19dd3f60-0134-11ec-9ffe-36de3c20a7dc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Motorola]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Motorola Edge]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Motorola Edge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter's latest round of updates are about to hit your DMs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1428408769835421701?s=20">introducing several tweaks</a> to its direct messaging functionality, with the improvements set to roll out in the coming weeks.

The Alphabet subsidiary just <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/MostExperiencedUrbanDriver.html"><ins>provided an update</ins></a> on its Waymo Driver AI as well as more details about its self-driving tests.</p><p>An array of LiDAR, radar and cameras can track what&#39;s going on all around the vehicle in a variety of weather conditions, Waymo says. The system generates a 3D view of the vehicle&#39;s surroundings that humans would be able to understand. Along with other cars, the system can render pedestrians in addition to cyclists who narrowly pass by the vehicle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="09484cec9ca246adb929d95d9013c613"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2u2HlTgEWY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company says Waymo Driver can detect small objects and movements at a distance, such as a truck door in the middle of traffic and someone jumping out to deliver a package. It claims the AI can recognize steam emanating from utility holes and drive the vehicle through it, and understand the difference between a stop sign and its reflection.</p><p>Waymo has been testing its vehicles in San Francisco since 2009 and it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymos-set-to-test-its-self-driving-taxis-in-san-francisco-195806282.html"><ins>ramped up its efforts</ins></a> in the city earlier this year. Its vehicles now clock north of 100,000 miles on SF&#39;s roads every week. Between narrow streets, drastic changes in elevation and intersections right at the top of hills, San Francisco isn&#39;t an easy city to drive in, which makes it an effective testing ground for AVs.</p><p>The company&#39;s vehicles have autonomously driven more than 20 million miles on public roads as well as 20 billion miles in simulations. That&#39;s a significant bank of data to draw from. Waymo says the AI can recognize and adapt to local driving behaviors, such as what lane to turn in at each intersection. According to the company, Waymo Driver can also mimic other vehicles&#39; behavior, such as in SF, where people tend to drive a little slower while going up steep slopes.</p><p>Fully autonomous driving is likely several years away from going mainstream, but it seems Waymo is making significant strides toward that goal. Hopefully, Waymo Driver is getting more comfortable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-213249367.html"><ins>around safety cones</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Waymo is beefing up its autonomous truck ambitions. On Wednesday, the company <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/08/expanding-our-waymo-via-operations.html"><ins>announced</ins></a> that it&#39;s building a trucking hub in Dallas-Fort Worth and partnering with Ryder to manage its fleet.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tesla&#39;s AI Day event takes place today.

After Blazkowicz talks back, J tells him: &quot;You don&#39;t get it, do you? Before all this, before the Germans, before the war, back home, man, you were the Nazis.&quot;</p><p>What I love about that scene is the way it complicates the easy narrative we so often tell ourselves about the Second World War. <em>The New Order</em> understands World War II better than almost any other game inspired by the conflict. Nazism, then as now, was <a href="https://time.com/5414055/american-nazi-sympathy-book/">never an ideology that only existed in Hitler&#39;s Germany</a>. And in internment camps across the US and Canada and cities like <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/apocalypse-dresden-february-1945">Dresden</a> and <a href="https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/atomic-bomb-hiroshima">Hiroshima</a>, the Allies committed countless injustices of their own.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3da73e6992e9491191459f2b94c206a2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ1CwPhE8KQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It&#39;s that scene my mind returned to as Sledgehammer Games revealed <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>, the next entry in Activision&#39;s long-running first-person shooter series, during an online event last week. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-14-call-of-duty-wwii-historic-warfare.html">2017&#39;s <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em></a><em>,</em> the studio&#39;s previous project as lead developer on the franchise, <em>Vanguard </em>takes the series back to where it all started: the Second World War.</p><p>After talking about the studio&#39;s commitment to diversity and creating a safe space for all employees, essentially repeating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html">same company line</a> Activision Blizzard executives have been saying ever since California <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">filed a sexual harassment lawsuit</a> against the publisher, Sledgehammer studio head Aaron Halon introduced  <em>Vanguard </em>director Josh Bridge and campaign director David Swenson. Bridge told us how the studio came out of <em>Call of Duty: WWII</em> feeling like it had only scratched the surface of the stories the conflict had to tell. &quot;We see [<em>Vanguard</em>] as being rooted in but not beholden to history. There is no revisionist history here,&quot; he said, a bullet point on his Powerpoint presentation reiterating the statement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/164d8890-00ea-11ec-abdf-e2fe16aa4da1" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="6882366a-9c1b-349b-a9f1-96f64d28e37b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>After showing the game&#39;s cinematic trailer and a snippet of gameplay, Swenson talked about the game&#39;s story. Like <em>The New Order</em>, <em>Vanguard</em> uses an alternate reality of the war to tell its story, but it appears a much less ambitious retelling on the surface. In a return to the way Infinity Ward did things when the series first started, <em>Vanguard</em>’s campaign will feature four playable characters, each loosely based on a different historical person.</p><p>In Polina Petrova, Sledgehammer took inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyudmila_Pavlichenko">Lyudmila Pavlichenko</a>, a Soviet sharpshooter who was known as Lady Death for her 309 confirmed kills, the most of any female sniper in history. Wade Jackson, one of the other characters, is based on <a href="https://www.jacksonville.com/article/20100804/NEWS/801247315">Vernon L. Micheel</a>, a US Navy pilot who bombed two Japanese aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway. Then there&#39;s Lucas Riggs. He draws from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Upham">Charles Upham</a>, the only soldier in World War II to earn two Victoria Cross medals.</p><p>Finally, you have Arthur Kingsley. His inspiration is <a href="https://www.pegasusarchive.org/normandy/sidney_cornell.htm">Sidney Cornell</a>, a Black British paratrooper who earned a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions in Normandy. To Sledgehammer&#39;s credit, the studio enlisted the help of science fiction writer <a href="https://www.tochionyebuchi.com/">Tochi Onyebuchi</a> to write Kingsley&#39;s character and cast Chike Okonkwo, best known for his role as Will in <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, to give him his voice.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a655ad0-00e9-11ec-bb1f-627f89322f0e" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="b2c6c7bb-23c4-3f30-8a09-bba9b1b7cfd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>Initially, those four find themselves in different theaters of the war, but they&#39;re eventually brought together to take part in a fictional mission called Operation Phoenix. The Nazis, under the guidance of a character named Heinrich Freisinger, have hatched a plan to survive the end of the war and it&#39;s up to the newly formed special forces team of Petrova, Jackson, Riggs and Kingsley to stop them. Like the four protagonists, Freisinger has a historical counterpart. He&#39;s based on the infamous Gestapo chief <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_M%C3%BCller_(Gestapo)">Heinrich Müller</a>.</p><p>Bridge said the studio sees the title as &quot;a filmic blockbuster, with a contemporary lens on history.&quot; The throughline that connects both the story and multiplayer components of the game is how the Second World War saw the birth of the modern idea of the special forces. This is World War II reframed as an entry point into the expanded Call of Duty universe. I won&#39;t say that&#39;s unexpected, but after Sledgehammer tried to tell a more nuanced story about PTSD in <em>CoD: WW2, </em>I had hoped it would set its sights even higher.</p><p>At the reveal event, Sledgehammer spent far more time talking about <em>Vanguard</em>’s story than letting the game speak for itself. Of the single-player campaign, the developer only showed a brief snippet of an early level that features Kingsley taking part in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Tonga">Operation Tonga</a>, which saw British paratroopers land near the city of Caen during the Allied invasion of Normandy. If you&#39;ve seen <em>Band of Brothers</em>, you already know exactly how this segment plays out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a14b0130-00e9-11ec-b373-79933b383e00" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="d9379ea9-0ef5-3008-baeb-008e50d431d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>You jump out of a plane as part of a pre-scripted sequence in which you lose your rifle before landing on the ground. After a series of quick time events, your character finds himself in front of a field, an objective marker telling the player to make their way to a windmill in the distance. For part of the level, you have to sneak your way through enemy lines.</p><p>Other than an unexpected moment toward the end of the clip, nothing about what I saw struck me as something the franchise hasn&#39;t done before, but the execution was still compelling. True to the conditions Allied paratroopers found themselves in during the D-Day invasion, much of the mission takes place in suffocating fog and darkness. That gave the level more of a sense of atmosphere than your typical CoD mission. In particular, the use of lighting was intentional in a way I hadn&#39;t seen from the series in a while, the effect made more realistic by the work Sledgehammer and the other CoD studios did to update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-30-call-duty-modern-warfare-campaign-preview-may-2019.html"><em>Modern Warfare&#39;s</em></a> IW 8.0 engine.</p><p>What also struck me about this sequence was the stolen Kar98K Kingsley used to dispatch his Nazi pursuers. When he fired the bolt-action rifle, it let out a deafening blast and left enemies crumpled against the floor and walls. There was more physicality to the weapon than the assault rifles that usually dominate the CoD metagame. That &quot;down the barrel&quot; gameplay is something the studio said it spent a lot of the nearly four years since <em>CoD: WW2 </em>perfecting.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e608f750-00e9-11ec-9af7-0dfed3fdb43d" alt="Call of Duty: Vanguard" data-uuid="6ebf6a6d-8ff9-3f09-9de7-6287bfbd0e82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sledgehammer Games / Activision</div></figure><p>It&#39;s hard to say if the rest of the single-player campaign adopts the more methodical pace to gunplay Sledgehammer showed off in the snippet I saw. However, I can state that multiplayer will feel familiar to current <em>Black Ops Cold War</em> and <em>Warzone</em> players. What you will find is that Sledgehammer designed the maps to feature more destructibility and interactive elements. A clip the studio shared showed off how you could shoot bookshelves, tables and boarded-up windows to open sightlines as a match progresses.</p><p>At launch, <em>Vanguard</em> will feature 20 multiplayer maps, 16 of which will support up to 12 players for six-on-six matches. Additionally, Sledgehammer is bringing Gunsmith back, a fan-favorite feature that allows you to customize your weapons with different attachments and ammo types. Naturally, Treyarch&#39;s Zombies mode is making a comeback, and it will connect to the lore established in <em>Black Ops Cold War</em>. Oh, and Raven Software is working on a <em>Warzone </em>map and update that will feature an all-new anti-cheat system. Sledgehammer promised to share more information about the multiplayer component of <em>Vanguard, </em>including details on a new mode called Champion Hill that the studio says will offer something new for players to experience, in the coming weeks.</p><p>That will give <em>Call of Duty</em> fans time to see if <em>Vanguard </em>is worth another trip to World War II before the game<em>&nbsp;</em>lands on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PS5 and PC via Battle.net on November 5th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-november-5-174533819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ee121b4-8672-42d3-ad47-74bc27971f4b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:45:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629395756</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T17:56:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a2d271b0-007f-11ec-b55d-e14ccf35a8ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a2d271b0-007f-11ec-b55d-e14ccf35a8ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sledgehammer Games / Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook is testing Reels in News Feed and Groups in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, some Facebook users in the US will see Reels, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-tiktok-rival-164624402.html">Instagram’s take on TikTok-like short-form videos</a>, appear throughout the company&#39;s main app, the social media giant told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632223/facebook-reels-update-app-test-launch"><em>The Verge</em></a>.

As such, <em>NHL 22</em> marks the &quot;biggest leap forward&quot; for the franchise in terms of gameplay and graphics, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210819005570/en/EA-SPORTS%E2%84%A2-NHL%C2%AE-22-Delivers-a-Breakthrough-Hockey-Experience-Powered-by-the-Frostbite-Engine%E2%84%A2-Arrives-on-Current-Next-gen-Consoles-October-15/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SP7CEH_PxTjduXJ0SDrbU6qcp-o_pnudlUwsb5apQ1S4gUE65BTfjH3-pSuqdv0gW3cb3F4oTIgUqCPafFkgu67Ap_pA_yJ1XPgPy1DuJnY">according to EA</a>.</p><p>Developer EA Vancouver has seemingly made every stitch of player uniforms visible via high-res graphics. Player models have been overhauled as well. EA says Frostbite enables enhanced spatial awareness, with players having upgraded eye animations and the ability to track and react to what&#39;s going on around them. The publisher is promising &quot;new physically accurate stick interactions&quot; as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d30612367dc4c2e9056c7186ab5a7ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RKtpwPUzF0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A system called Superstar X-Factors brings unique moves to some of the more high-profile hockey pros with abilities based on their real-world traits. For instance, cover star and Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews&#39; Shock and Awe move allows you to let fly with &quot;exciting shots,&quot; while Andrei Vasilevskiy’s Contortionist ability plays into the Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender&#39;s body-twisting flair to let him pull off impressive saves. Superstar X-Factors will feature in the Franchise Mode, as well as the Be A Pro, Hockey Ultimate Team and World of Chel modes.</p><p><em>NHL 22 </em>is the first game in the series to have dedicated PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions. It&#39;s also coming to PS4 and Xbox One, but the standard edition doesn&#39;t include a free upgrade to the PS5/Series X/S versions through EA&#39;s Dual Entitlement system.</p><p>For that, you&#39;ll need to opt for the X-Factor edition, which includes extra Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) packs and other bonuses, as well as three days of early access. If you buy the <em>NHL 22 </em>X-Factor edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you&#39;ll also have access to the respective previous-gen versions. However, the only game progress you can move from previous-gen consoles to PS5 or Xbox Series X/S is your HUT team, and it&#39;s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-22/buy/nhl-22-dual-entitlement-faq">a one-time content migration</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The FIFA and Madden NFL games moved to Frostbite in 2016 and 2017 respectively, so NHL is lagging behind a bit. That said, Frostbite was primarily designed for Battlefield and other first-person shooters. Some EA studios, such as BioWare, have found the engine <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428"><ins>difficult to work with</ins></a> and had to build some of the tools they needed from scratch.

It&#39;s basically a regular smartphone you can fold in half and it could appeal to the swaths of people who miss the satisfying snap of a flip phone. Plus, with a price drop, the new Flip now costs about the same as an iPhone or Galaxy S flagship. Samsung’s latest foldable also features a larger external display than its predecessor, making it more useful when closed, and has water resistance for some peace of mind. It’s even got a faster screen than Apple and Google offer and nifty software that makes better use of the screen when you prop it up on a surface. But the question remains, even at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:a more reasonable $1,000" href="https://fave.co/3gch6c6">a more reasonable $1,000</a>, is the Flip 3 good enough to usher foldables into the mainstream or are they still a gimmick?</p><h2>Design and durability</h2><p>One of the most important factors in determining if the Flip 3 is ready for daily use is durability. Samsung used stronger aluminum for the Flip 3’s frame, refined its hinge and made the screen tougher with a new flexible PET protector. I can’t tell exactly how much more durable the Flip 3 is compared to its predecessor, but I have been taking more risks with it. In fact, I consider my placing the Flip 3 (and the Fold 3, for that matter) into my bag along with my keys, laptop and DSLR the bravest thing I’ve ever done during a review.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’m mostly worried because of a bad experience when I took the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-24-hour-test-camera-samples-motorola-razr-comparison.html">original Z Flip out for a day</a>. It vibrated off a table and cracked its corner. I’ve been fairly careful with the Flip 3, but I’ve avoided babying it, and so far it’s survived being tossed into a bag with various sharp objects. While it’s still prone to sliding around due to its glossy glass exterior, it’s yet to fall off anything. I’ve placed it on treadmills, ellipticals, window ledges and restaurant tables and I don’t want to jinx it but: so far my Flip 3 is scratch-free.</p><p>Does that mean it’ll remain pristine a week, a month or even a year from now? Probably not. But as someone who’s cracked her fair share of phone screens, I feel like the Flip 3 is about as sturdy as most glass-covered flagships.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e443b4c0-00f6-11ec-8f7f-3ee177ea0dd6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 fully open, held vertically in a hand with its screen facing the camera." data-uuid="8672e604-4c18-39b4-93fa-2b64d4adbd74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>That is, with one exception: Its flexible internal screen is still more likely to break than others, if for no reason other than you’ll invariably end up pushing into some part of it to close the device. I’ve yet to damage the Flip 3’s screen, and I’ve been careful not to push my thumb into the middle of the panel to close the phone, but I’ve been shutting it with some force. Whether the durability is indeed improved is something that’s hard to tell without months of testing or deliberately trying to damage the device, so I might have to revisit this after some time.</p><p>Speaking of closing the phone: Like its predecessor, the Flip 3 isn’t easy to shut with one hand. It <em>can </em>be done, but the hinge is stiff and provides enough resistance to let it stay open at various angles. Unless you have Dwayne Johnson’s hands, you’ll probably need some leverage to open or close the Flip 3.</p><p>Oh and thanks to the IPX8 water resistance, I was a lot less worried about leaving the Flip next to my sink when I washed my face and dripped all over it while reaching for the soap.</p><p>Besides improved durability and a larger external screen, not much has changed between the new Flip and the last generation. They weigh the same 183 grams (6.45 ounces) and the Flip 3 is a hair thicker. Samsung’s also offering a few new color options, including my two favorites: green and lavender. My review unit is a boring cream/off-white, though.</p><p>Phones in the same size and price range like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">the iPhone 12 Pro</a> Max and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-s21-plus-s21-ultra-first-look-hands-on-150014483.html">Galaxy S21+</a> are slightly heavier and thicker, but not by much. Of course, these devices are dust-resistant and sport triple cameras, while the Flip has just two. The conventional flagships are also not as narrow. But aside from the aspect ratio, the Flip 3 feels very much like a regular smartphone when unfolded. Bonus: It’s more compact when folded in half, which helps it fit into most of my pockets without peeking out. It actually almost reminds me of a pager when closed. Remember those?</p><section data-eng-breakout="a4210a0b68344d1b9a58f11860df9cad" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30c239c0-00f7-11ec-9fd8-797a1246144d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded, with its Cover Display showing a cartoon animal and the time."></section><h2>A bigger, more useful Cover Display</h2><p>The greatest difference between the Flip 3 and a typical smartphone is that you can close it, which is not only a satisfying means of putting your phone away, but also introduces a new way to interact with the device. The 1.9-inch external screen is four times larger than the previous model, and can show up to four lines of notifications at once. There are currently six widgets available for this window, which Samsung calls the Cover Display. To interact with this panel, you’ll have to first double tap on it, then swipe vertically or horizontally to see your notifications or widgets respectively.</p><p>This was a little confusing initially, as I didn’t know I needed to tap the screen before swiping. But after figuring it out, I’ve come to appreciate it because it prevents accidentally dismissing notifications and skipping songs on Spotify. That’s pretty helpful since I often unintentionally touch the Cover Display when closing the phone or picking it up.</p><p>Most of the time, I leave the Flip 3 closed until I need to reply to a message or when I start browsing my feeds. It’s certainly a lot less distracting to be able to put my phone aside and not have a long list of notifications that I can see from a distance. I initially set all six widgets to appear on my Cover Display, so scrolling sideways would bring up the weather, media controls, Samsung Pay, Health, Calendar and so on.</p><p>While I appreciated having all those options, after a while it became clear three widgets is plenty  — the endless swiping got tiring eventually. The software is also a little buggy at the moment. The alarms widget, for example, will randomly abandon its countdown if you pause and resume it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a7220730-00f7-11ec-877f-cd30e99d43ce" alt="A hand holding the closed Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 with its Cover Display facing the camera." data-uuid="60df54bd-7dde-3300-bb3d-32a38aa253f0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Another feature that sounds great in theory is using your Cover Display as a viewfinder. With the larger panel, you’ll have more room to frame up your selfies on the Flip 3 with the screen closed. I used it to snap a picture with three staff members of my building and while we were able to squeeze everyone in, the novelty wore off quickly.</p><p>The only time I can see preferring the outside screen as a viewfinder is if you need the sharper or wider rear cameras or when you’re really in a hurry and can’t spare the one or two seconds it takes to open the phone. I like that Samsung gives us this option, but even a selfie-obsessed person like me was never in that much of a rush to snap a portrait. Plus, the photos taken this way end up in a strange squarish crop, while those snapped using the main screen as a viewfinder are taller or wider.</p><h2>Internal screen and Flex mode</h2><p>When you’re back on the main screen, aspect ratio is still somewhat of an issue. The Flip 3’s 6.7-inch display runs at 2,640 x 1,080, which comes up to an uncommon 22:9 format. This didn’t cause too many problems — most apps fit nicely on the screen — but every now and then something will overflow. The pop-up dialogs in <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, for example, disappear into the edges of the display and I can barely tap the buttons I need to move on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dba5c8c0-00f7-11ec-beb2-ed4299ddc48d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 held horizontally between two hands, with the screen showing the Settlers of Catan app with " data-uuid="b4684c29-b27b-3671-b283-90a635a09521"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fortunately, I didn’t encounter this on most of my frequently used apps, but for now Samsung doesn’t have a workaround to help ensure you can see everything on the Flex.</p><p>That’s my main issue with the Flip 3’s internal screen, which is otherwise a lovely canvas for browsing Instagram and YouTube thanks to its flexible AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Images were vibrant with deep blacks and high contrast, and the display never stuttered when I scrolled my feeds in a frenzy. Oh I also didn’t mind the crease in the middle — yes it’s noticeable and does cause some distortion, but it doesn’t get in the way of readability. I also like how it felt beneath my thumb as I scrolled past it. It’s like stroking a soft, naked tendon, which is a lot better than it sounds.</p><p>Another update that makes the Flip 3 a better multimedia device than before are its stereo speakers. Now, when you hold it up to watch a video, you’ll hear its audio from both ends. It’s a little too easy to cover the bottom speaker with your hand when holding the phone horizontally, though.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0b4e8f30-00f8-11ec-afef-ec57a35b496e" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded to prop itself up on a table, with the top half of its screen showing a YouTube video and the bottom showing the title, likes, dislikes, channel, top comment and suggested videos." data-uuid="6bb984da-d64e-3147-942b-d91190dc65e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Something else the Flip offers that regular smartphones don’t is a Flex mode that kicks in when you half-fold the device. This only works on some apps, like Gallery, Camera and YouTube, where the screen is split in half to show your photo, viewfinder or video on top and navigation, controls or more info at the bottom. When you set the Flip 3 up on a table in Flex mode, you can watch your show as if it were full screen on the top half, while scrolling comments or suggested videos below.</p><p>I thought I’d only find Flex mode useful with the Flip 3 sitting on a table (propped up like it has its own kickstand), but it actually was more helpful in enabling one-handed use. Because the screen is so tall, some elements are out of my thumb’s reach. Flex mode makes scrolling pictures in my gallery or snapping a picture much easier with one hand. So far, though, only a handful of apps support this, so Samsung will need to work harder to make more of them compatible.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The Flip 3’s dual 12-megapixel cameras hold their own against the likes of the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. While Samsung, Apple and Google all have minor differences in the color temperature of their photos, they deliver similar quality and clarity in most situations. The Flip 3’s picture of a yummy bowl of noodles was just as bright and vibrant as those taken with the Pixel and iPhone, though it’s a little soft and failed to capture some detail on the ceramic surface.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e42f380-00f8-11ec-9f6e-75cb94987b1f" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&#39;s Cover Display and dual 12-megapixel cameras next to it." data-uuid="63cc2bea-cb10-349b-af5a-b0af50cf887c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Photos the Flip 3 shot at night are also similar to those from the competition — you’d need to really scrutinize minor exposure and noise differences to tell them apart. The pictures I snapped of a dog park and the city skyline at night all came out bright and colorful, though Google delivered a better closeup of the New York City nightscape thanks to its superior processing software.</p><p>The selfies captured by the Flip 3’s 10-megapixel camera were also bright and sharp. And, based on an informal poll on my Instagram, the majority of my followers preferred a portrait shot by the Flip 3 to the Pixel 5.</p><section data-eng-breakout="881a9243ddf54db79e4e9b4e4c2b7d57" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1969980-00f8-11ec-ba9f-8771adb574e7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 unfolded in someone&#39;s hand, with its rear facing the camera"></section><h2>Living the foldable life: In use and battery</h2><p>With a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Flip 3 performed smoothly during my testing. I haven’t encountered many delays when using the main screen to message my friends, post to Twitter and browse websites. It didn’t let up even as I recorded the screen while using the camera to capture footage of my friends trying to perform TikTok dances, either.</p><p>Occasionally, I felt like websites were scrolling more slowly than I was used to, and there are still some small software bugs (like the Cover Display’s alarm widget) that make the Flip 3 feel like it needs a bit more polish. But aside from these minor gripes and the fact that you can fold it, this phone feels very similar to its Samsung siblings.</p><p>That is, until we consider battery life. The Flip 3 never made it through a full day before needing a charge, and that runtime dropped when I enabled the Always On Display for the outer screen. On our video rundown test, the Flip 3 only clocked 11 hours and 27 minutes, which is shorter than most flagships I&#39;ve tested recently. The S21’s 4,000mAh cell typically stuck around for a day and a half, while the latest Pixels and iPhones easily outlast the Flip 3. Despite offering a larger Cover Display and a higher refresh rate on its main panel, the Flip 3’s 3,300mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, which might explain its disappointing endurance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/423d19c0-00f9-11ec-bdd7-634abf3e7174" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded and propped up in tent mode on a table." data-uuid="2e07df85-cb93-324a-9610-12f3638b8601"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After spending some time with the Flip 3 in the real world, I’ve come to realize a few things: I like being able to fold a phone, put it away and focus on work or living in the moment. But I can also turn a regular phone face down to do that. I enjoy the nostalgia and novelty of closing the Flip 3 when I’m mad at a caller or an app, too.</p><p>In general, the satisfaction and space savings from being able to fold a phone in half are not worth paying a premium for. The good news is that with the Flip 3, Samsung isn’t charging a hefty premium or making many compromises. Battery life is an unfortunate victim of the Flip 3’s larger external screen, but it’s at least not so short that you’ll need to charge it twice a day.</p><p>Ultimately, the Flip 3 is proof that Samsung can deliver a good phone with a foldable display at a relatively reasonable price. It’s also a satisfying upgrade from its predecessor, thanks to its water resistance and bigger outside screen. The most important question now is: Who should buy this? If you pride yourself on being an early adopter and want to get on the foldables bandwagon before they become more common, that might be you. The Flip 3 is a device capable of being a daily driver for those nostalgic or curious enough to buy one. But for a more mainstream audience, there simply aren’t enough benefits yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, thanks to water resistance and a larger, more useful Cover Display. Its $1,000 starting price puts it in the same class as flagships from Apple, Google and Samsung itself, too. While it mostly behaves like a regular modern smartphone that you can fold in half, the Flip 3 is held back by battery life and potential durability issues.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 or 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor (2.84Ghz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz)</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 8GB with 128/256GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Main display</strong>: 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display</p><p><strong>Main display resolution</strong>: 2,640 x 1,080 (22:9)</p><p><strong>External display</strong>: 1.9-inch Super AMOLED</p><p><strong>External display resolution</strong>: 260 x 512</p><p><strong>Rear (or external) cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera with OIS and 78-degree FOV, 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (123-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front (or inside) camera</strong>: 10MP f/2.4 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with One UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 3,300mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C with fast wired charging at 15W (QC2.0 and AFC) and fast wireless charging at 10W (WPC and PMA).

The latest trailer doesn&#39;t reveal too much about the story, but it has some impressive visuals.&nbsp;</p><p>The clip features a elevator that, according to showrunner David S. Goyer, stretches around 26 miles into space. There&#39;s also a floating visualization of a supercomputer that takes design cues from a Möbius strip. Goyer told <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/foundation-exclusive-trailer-breakdown-with-showrunner-david-s-goyer"><em>IGN</em></a> that he challenged his production team to find a look that didn&#39;t remind viewers of Star Wars or Star Trek, perhaps the two biggest linchpins of science fiction. In any case, it&#39;s clear Apple hasn&#39;t skimped on the budget.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fc50c3de6108416684440f69d161b7b3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4QYV5GTz7c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The show seems to be much more about humanity more than eye-popping visual effects, though. Based on a series of Isaac Asimov novels, <em>Foundation </em>centers around a group of exiles who try to protect the future of civilization after leader Dr. Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) uses data to predict the fall of the Galactic Empire. What&#39;s left of the Empire isn&#39;t too thrilled about that, and it tries to suppress Seldon&#39;s group.</p><p>The story plays out over the course of a millennium. The first season will run for 10 episodes, with the first two episodes dropping at the same time and the remainder hitting Apple TV+ on a weekly basis.</p><p>Apple TV+ has more sci-fi projects on the way. <em>Invasion</em>, oddly enough, is a series about an alien invasion. It debuts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-invasion-trailer-222925428.html"><ins>on October 22nd</ins></a>. A couple of weeks later, on November 5th, Apple will release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tom-hanks-finch-release-date-085915154.html"><em><ins>Finch</ins></em></a>, a movie starring Tom Hanks as an inventor who hits the road with his dog and a robot. A third season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/For%20All%20Mankind"><em><ins>For All Mankind</ins></em></a> is also in the works.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-foundation-trailer-isaac-asimov-154330992.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a483aa30-3a8b-48e0-9e3e-3fb0282fc478</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 15:43:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629387812</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T15:43:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/76b6c500-0100-11ec-b1f8-869df5a5895f" width="3840" height="1917" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/76b6c500-0100-11ec-b1f8-869df5a5895f" width="3840" height="1917" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple TV+]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple TV+ series Foundation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ series Foundation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft announces a $60 wired Xbox Stereo Headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/microsoft"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> has unveiled a wired Xbox Stereo Headset.

This isn&#39;t as sweet as what you&#39;ll get at AT&amp;T proper, but it will give you a chance to catch up on shows without pricier wireless service or a separate Max subscription.</p><p>The offer will be available to both new and current customers starting on August 20th.

The telecom will likely still own WarnerMedia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">until 2022</a>, and this gives it a chance to boost both Cricket and HBO Max until that split happens. It could help the company maintain or increase plan prices, too. Nonetheless, you might appreciate this if you&#39;re looking to save money.

The retailer plans to open several large physical locations in the US akin to department stores, according to anonymous sources cited by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-retail-department-stores-11629330842"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The new stores — the first of which will come to Ohio and California — will sell clothing, household items and electronics from &quot;top consumer brands.&quot; Obviously, shoppers can also expect to run into Amazon&#39;s own-brand products, too.</p><p>While the sites are tipped to be around the third of the size of a typical department store at 30,000 square feet, they&#39;ll still be much larger than Amazon&#39;s other physical locations. The move sees the company expanding into an area it originally disrupted as it grew into an all-in-one online shopping destination.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With their sales already <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21717536/department-store-middle-class-amazon-online-shopping-covid-19">plummeting</a>, the pandemic sealed the fate of several high-profile department stores. The likes of J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus Group have filed for bankruptcy along with other big names in the sector. Though some were thrown a lifeline when they managed to attract new owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, has seen its fortunes skyrocket during the pandemic as it profited from an increasing shift toward e-commerce. Its booming business even helping to bankroll founder Jeff Bezos&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bezos-space-flight-blue-origin-quotes-204210894.html">trip into space</a>.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s move into physical retail predates the virus, however. The company started with brick and mortar bookstores back in 2015, later acquiring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-16-amazon-buying-whole-foods.html">Whole Foods</a> for $13.4 billion in 2017. More recently, it opened cashierless <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Amazon%20Go">Amazon Go</a> stores in the US and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-go-store-uk-084721065.html">UK</a>. Not to mention its highly-curated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-amazon-4-star-store-colorado.html">Amazon 4-star</a> stores and Amazon Pop-Ups inside malls.</p><p>The larger stores are apparently viewed as a way of letting shoppers try before they buy, which is particularly useful for things like apparel. That&#39;s an area where Amazon has historically struggled. As the <em>WSJ</em> notes, the only high-fashion label on its online store is Oscar de la Renta. It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-nike-ending-retail-pilot-amazon.html">lost a major seller in Nike</a> in 2019, which decided to go it alone in e-commerce — a move that has <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-q-4-2021-earnings-165843774.html">paid off</a> for the sneaker company.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s department stores would also allow it to showcase its range of electronics, from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Fire%20TV">Fire TVs</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-fire-hd-10-tablets-plus-kids-pro-130029307.html">tablets</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">Echo speakers</a> to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-floodlight-camera-radar-birds-eye-view-133002075.html">Ring</a> home security range, and even its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-fire-tv-133058253.html">Luna</a> cloud gaming service.

Sure, they can go on too long, be scheduled far too often and distract from your core work. But even before the pandemic made them an exotic memory, I always loved the energy of being in a room with other people, finding the same creative wavelength, working towards a common goal. There&#39;s no video chat app that can replicate that. So, what about VR?</p><p>We&#39;ve already seen companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spatial-ar-vr-meetings-free-oculus-quest-100008450.html">Spatial take a stab at virtual meetings</a>, where you can chat with others, inspect objects and even explore 3D environments from the comfort your home with a VR headset. Now Facebook&#39;s Oculus is <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/workrooms/">entering the fray with Horizon Workrooms</a>, an ambitious attempt to capture the best aspects of in-person meetings for Oculus Quest 2 users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="657ac916-9645-4dd3-8b95-5483103c34cb"/><p>To be clear, Workrooms <em>isn&#39;t</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-oculus-vr-hands-on-170017517.html">Facebook Horizon</a>, its long-awaited multiplayer VR playground. But it is part of the company&#39;s overall vision for the Horizon universe, one entirely devoted to collaborating in meeting rooms and classrooms. And despite being so focused, it&#39;s still a showpiece for Facebook&#39;s VR ambitions, tapping into the company&#39;s expressive avatars, spatial sound, hand tracking and mixed-reality capabilities. You&#39;ll even be able to stream your PC desktop in VR to take notes or goof off during meetings (just like real life!).</p><div id="274f6bcab9294e039d8bacf6c00f9fc9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgj50IxRrKQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>After spending an hour in a Horizon Workrooms demo, it&#39;s clear that Facebook still has plenty of work left to do. There were a few connection issues, avatar glitches and at one point I got booted out entirely. But when it was running smoothly, it was the closest I&#39;ve felt to being in an live meeting since March of last year.</p><p>But let me start from the beginning. After creating a Workrooms account, I installed the PC companion app and the Workrooms Quest 2 app. Once I booted it up in VR, I was surprised that it recommended putting my controllers down and enabling the Quest 2&#39;s hand-tracking. Outside of demos for that feature, I can&#39;t think of any Oculus apps that have done the same. After that, I customized a goofy avatar — an idealized version of myself with purple hair and no beer belly — and mapped out the edge of my desk so Workrooms can accurately place me in front of virtual tables.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd3a0380-00b3-11ec-9fae-25e7c8de8969" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="b577c2b5-99bc-345f-8a43-90a665e66466"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>As soon as I hopped into my Horizon Workrooms demo, it was instantly clear why Oculus recommended hand-tracking. I waved to a PR rep, and as I struggled to unmute myself, I was able to throw a thumbs up to confirm I was hearing her. I shouted hello to CNET&#39;s Scott Stein, who was sitting a few seats away, and his audio sounded appropriately far off. We all spent way too much time staring at our hands and testing the limits of the Quest 2&#39;s finger tracking capabilities (for the record, rolling your hands over each other like a wannabe raver can easily scramble things).</p><p>Even though I was in a swanky virtual room, with a stylized deer head wearing VR goggles on the wall, and ceiling-tall windows overlooking expansive lake and mountain rage somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, sitting desk-side with others felt vaguely normal. We made small talk about our families and our vastly different locations (including folks in California, New Jersey, London and myself in Atlanta). I could see who was working on Macs and PCs, based on the virtual accessories in front of them. And along the wall there were also video feeds from other Facebook reps calling in from their PCs, which reminded me of the enormous video conferencing screens in many meeting rooms.</p><section data-eng-breakout="914d48ea957a4bc6af6047f91aa9ad21" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd4463c0-00b3-11ec-a8fb-bb128f10ddf0" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms"></section><p>To see my keyboard and mouse, I hit a button to enable pass-through mode, which projected grey-scale footage of my actual desk inside of Workrooms&#39; VR environment. It wasn&#39;t crystal clear, but it was enough to touch-type notes in Evernote by streaming my PC desktop. If you&#39;re running an Apple Magic Keyboard or a specific Logitech model, you&#39;ll also be able to see your keyboard in VR, so you won&#39;t have to deal with the pass-through video.</p><p>Andrew Bosworth, Facebook&#39;s head of VR and AR, said during the demo that he believes there&#39;s &quot;something missing&quot; with video calling, and that there&#39;s a strong pull towards VR collaboration apps as a solution. Of course, that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect Facebook&#39;s VR lead to say. But he has a point.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a9ecd40-012a-11ec-b7ce-888cf1182348" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="496b430f-8af1-3969-8ac5-40ceee1ad56a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Video calls are a fantastic way for seeing people and maintaining social connections. But when it comes to getting work done, they can get old fast. Everyone&#39;s audio comes in from one channel; it&#39;s hard to make eye contact in large group chats; and the entire session just lives on your computer or phone screen. There&#39;s no sense of actually being in a space with others. Bosworth says that Facebook has been using Workrooms internally for about six months, and he&#39;s noticed some clear benefits. In particular, he can remember specific meetings better thanks to the immersion of sitting beside people in VR with realistic spatial audio.</p><p>Of course, virtual reality can also make meetings awkward in entirely new ways. I quickly learned that I couldn&#39;t look closely at someone&#39;s avatar if they were sitting nearby, because it actually felt like I was staring at them. I couldn&#39;t reach for a cup of water on my real-world desk, because it was sitting in front of my neighbor&#39;s virtual space. I also had to be careful about where I placed my hands, because the Quest 2&#39;s hand tracking could make things look... suspect, if they&#39;re under your desk.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8aa18c60-012a-11ec-bfcf-70c9110e3192" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="069fb176-9e14-394a-9a1d-abe6981ac4d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>All of that awkwardness culminated when Mark Zuckerberg crashed our demo and sat in the virtual chair beside me. He sketched out his overall vision for Horizon as a stepping stone for his metaverse ambitions. But as he was speaking, I was also trying hard to keep my virtual cool: Don&#39;t stare! Don&#39;t be weird with your hands! Pay attention and be respectful! I thought I was doing pretty well in the heat of the moment, but a recording of our session looked like I was performing some sort of interpretive dance beside the world&#39;s fifth richest man. (Thankfully, that footage isn&#39;t meant for public consumption.)</p><p>Zuckerberg only stopped by for a few minutes, but the fact he made an appearance at all is telling. Workrooms isn&#39;t some side project: It&#39;s a significant component of what he wants Facebook to become. You can see that in the app&#39;s more ambitious features, like a whiteboard that can grow as long as you&#39;d like. You can sketch out thoughts by holding your Oculus controller straight up, so that you can use the end like a massive pen. And if you want to stretch your legs, you can assign a blank wall in your room to serve as your life-sized whiteboard. You can also change the size and layout of your workspace at will, allowing you to move from a circular conference table to something that resembles a classroom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd391920-00b3-11ec-b7f7-7424f1ebcef7" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="71a90691-0de0-3c9a-886b-48e86cfffa71"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Perhaps because Zuckerberg wants Workrooms to be a success, the company is also making it more accessible to people who don&#39;t want Facebook accounts. You can join a session via video chat by creating a Workrooms account, which is separate from Oculus and Facebook logins. If you want to enjoy the experience in VR, though, you&#39;ll need a Facebook account to use the Quest 2. Maybe letting people peek at the 2D Workrooms experience could encourage them to go virtual.</p><p>The company is also being up-front about security and privacy, saying that it won&#39;t use conversations or materials from Workrooms sessions to inform Facebook ads. You&#39;ll also be able to report individuals and entire groups if they&#39;re harassing you or violating community standards. That was a major concern when I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-oculus-vr-hands-on-170017517.html">demoed Facebook Horizons last year</a>; the idea of a VR playground sounds great, but how do you make it safe for <em>everyone</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, Horizon Workrooms tells us that Zuckerberg&#39;s metaverse ambitions are more than just marketing fluff. He paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-25-facebook-oculus-vr-2-billion.html">$2 billion for Oculus</a>, after all, and Facebook has continually invested in VR development and content. You don&#39;t spend that sort of money if you don&#39;t have a vision for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>When he stopped by our demo, Zuckerberg told us he used to scribble code in his notebook during middle school. As soon as he got home, he would type it up with the hopes of building an immersive world to hang out with friends. Workrooms isn&#39;t the perfect VR collaboration solution yet, but it could be the start of what the younger Zuckerberg envisioned. After all, the metaverse won&#39;t be built in a day.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0c3009f3-c93d-419e-89aa-d7e3b04db07a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 11:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629404413</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T20:20:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd398e50-00b3-11ec-baf6-8cf3ffd51f1f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd398e50-00b3-11ec-baf6-8cf3ffd51f1f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Horizon Workrooms]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Horizon Workrooms]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Splitgate', the FPS with portals, has shot past 10 million downloads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Splitgate</em>, a frenetic free-to-play arena shooter with portals, has become a word of mouth hit with 10 million downloads in under 30 days. Developer 1047 Games has announced that the game will remain in open beta indefinitely as it works on managing the sudden influx of players. As a result, <em>Splitgate </em>is no longer slated to fully launch this month. Instead, 1047 will continue to roll out updates and fixes to the game complete with new content and improvements to the backend that can facilitate the uptick in players. Queue times are now less than 10 minutes and a new Ranked Duos mode recently went live.</p><p><em>Splitgate </em>injected the tired arena shooter with a much needed blast of vitality by adding portals to the mix. Players can cast these wormholes around the map and even shoot opponents through them. It helps that it&#39;s free-to-play, contains a variety of guns and plenty of game modes (like Team deathmatch, Team Shotty Snipers and Team SWAT).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the game has been in early access since 2019, it exploded in popularity in the wake of its open beta launch in early July, which brought with it cross-play with Xbox and PlayStation consoles. According to 1047, the shooter went from an initial 4,000 concurrent players to more than 175,000 in a few weeks. Naturally, the massive increase caused backend issues. <em>Splitgate</em> was taken offline twice in recent weeks as the small 1047 team worked on server optimizations.&nbsp;</p><div id="268f6b2cf136416c86ce52e43e469382"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nil86RfgEFE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In late July, the developer announced that it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-26-spiltgate-developer-1047-games-raises-usd10m-in-funding">raised</a> $10 million in a recent funding round led by Human Capital on top of the $6.5 million it snagged earlier in the year. 1047 said it would put the money toward expanding its engineering team. The company also has a major announcement in store for Gamescom later this month as it looks to build on <em>Splitgate</em>&#39;s breakout success. In a recent Q&amp;A session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1113426127">Twitch</a>, the developer <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/splitgate-developer-says-switch-port-is-absolutely-part-of-the-vision-3018747">reportedly</a> mentioned that a Switch and mobile port of the game was &quot;part of the vision.&quot;</p><p>“This has been the most surreal time of my life,” said Ian Proulx, CEO and co-founder of 1047 Games. “The fan support has been incredible as we work to improve the player experience. We never dreamed of having to scale this big this quickly, and as a result we have had to overcome challenges to keep up with player demand. We met several major milestones in a short time, creating a stable platform where fans can expect to find a server to play on relatively quickly, and I’m proud of what our team has accomplished - but there’s a lot more to come!”</p><p>Proulx continued, “In looking at the issues facing the scalability of the game’s backend, the process includes far more than simply dealing with server capacity. We are focused on keeping the game stable for fans, and iterating on the game’s concurrent capacity in order to minimize player wait times. We want to do this the right way, and we want to be prepared for massive scale when we officially launch, all the while continuing to improve the beta with frequent updates, additional features, and improvements to server capacity.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7afed1df-42e2-44c6-a31a-fa19ed252d53</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 10:09:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629387673</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T15:41:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64052140-00d3-11ec-bfdf-8cd81a375c25" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64052140-00d3-11ec-bfdf-8cd81a375c25" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Lower Decks' is an indictment of Abrams and Kurtzman-era Star Trek]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains spoilers for season two, episode two of &#39;Star Trek: Lower Decks.&#39;</em></p><p>I’ve been a Star Trek fan for most of my life, and yet I still chuckled at this <em>Onion</em> video released after the first J.J. Abrams installment came out back in 2009: “Trekkies Bash New Star Trek Film As &#39;Fun, Watchable.’” Star Trek isn’t to a lot of people’s taste, J.J. Abrams’ among them. He’s said in interviews <a href="https://youtu.be/-mSM5BCUhZ4">he never really liked Trek</a> and was trying to make it more like Star Wars.

The reboot films were a breath of fresh air after four years of no original Trek content, and they did get some new fans into the franchise. Some of those novices would later dip their toe into the water of TV Trek and found that they did actually enjoy it a lot, despite its slower pace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="07d158d2cd0a4bd1b7058f69d3a89386"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02LgdXVkXgM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>However, despite the franchise’s strong TV track record with shows like <em>TNG</em> and <em>DS9</em>, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> era has been taking its cues from the Abrams films, which isn’t surprising with executive producer Alex Kurtzman <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cbs-alex-kurtzman-star-trek-deal-165454180.html">at the helm</a>. Alongside Roberto Orci, he’s one of the two screenwriters behind 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> and 2013’s <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, as well as a J.J. Abrams collaborator on <em>Alias</em> and <em>Fringe</em>. Given the box office numbers of the Abramsverse films it makes sense to put him in charge, but it still made a lot of long-time Trekkies groan as we had hoped for a return to the kind of shows we grew up on.</p><p>After three seasons of heavy action on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-trailer-040651412.html"><em>Discovery</em></a> and the jaded grimdark of season one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html"><em>Picard</em></a>, the first season of <em>Lower Decks</em> injected some levity back into the franchise, with parody that went up to, but not quite over the line. It couldn’t, since it was intended to be canon. It had to fit alongside <em>TNG</em>, <em>DS9</em> and <em>Voyager</em>. So it packed in plenty of references to keep the wiki addicts over at the Star Trek-centric <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main">Memory Alpha</a> busy, while indulging in old tropes like drunk Klingons, arena battles and the occasional omnipotent being. It also took some direct swipes at the live action Trek shows, like how crew members always seem to die in the most low-tech ways like being impaled by spears or how <em>of course</em> the holodeck is used for sex stuff.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/11622440-f94b-11eb-b0ff-780b000ec0ae" data-uuid="5297f039-4213-32d1-96da-cfb8243d6086"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>But those references were always in a more general sense, framed in a “wouldn’t X be ridiculous” way that only long-term fans with deep knowledge of the franchise would fully understand. Until this week’s episode, that is, where crew members of the <em>USS Titan</em> specifically call out the Enterprise D and its galactic cruise ship mentality. Shakespearean plays and string quartets? Peace conferences? How utterly boring compared to the constant run-and-gun that the <em>Titan</em> seems to have been stuck in since last season. They judge the value of their work based on how exciting it is, and think that William Riker must have been bored to tears being stuck on that ship for seven years.</p><p>Of course, <em>TNG</em> fans know it was anything but boring for Riker. He’s been locked in a mental institution, trapped in an alternate future and even had god-like powers for an episode. And he <em>likes</em> performing in jazz concerts with his trombone!</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/40a91ba0-f94b-11eb-aede-d8c58bddfe3f" alt="Pictured: Jonathan Frakes as Captain William T.

The Titan’s pursuit of the dangerous Pakleds has the young lieutenant junior grade in a constant state of panic as he mans the flight conn position, a big change from quietly toiling away on the lower decks of his old ship. But he’s recognized that this is where the opportunities for promotion are, and soon finds himself on an undercover mission with his fellow bridge crew. At least, it’s supposed to be undercover — the other <em>Titan</em> members quickly get them embroiled in a shootout and facing certain death.</p><p>That’s when Boimler takes the opportunity to tell his crewmates how he really feels. “I’d love to be in a string quartet. I love that when Riker was on the Enterprise he was out there jamming on the trombone and catching love disease and acting in plays and meeting his identical transporter clone Thomas. That stuff might not seem as cool as what you guys do, but it’s Starfleet, all the way.” His confession elicits similar confessions from the other team members, before they manage to find a way out in classic technobabble fashion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5777bb20-f94b-11eb-9dff-936597267ea8" data-uuid="7f80e5a7-3ea1-35c2-aa82-2e448be034a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>For years Star Trek has always danced around the question of whether Starfleet was a military force. It employs naval ranks and the ships are outfitted with phasers and photon torpedoes for defense. But its stated purpose was exploration and other activities that help tie the vast Federation together. The Abrams films spent all their time reacting to one crisis after another — the crew didn’t start an actual mission of exploration until the very end of <em>Beyond</em>, and there hasn’t been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-movie-2023-paramount-pictures-schedule-190520920.html">another film</a> since to follow up on that.</p><p>Both <em>DS9</em> and <em>Discovery</em> engaged in wars with the Klingon Empire. On <em>Enterprise</em> the crew ended up hunting down the Xindi with a cadre of trained soldiers on board for its third season. Even <em>Voyager</em> had to deal with the constant accusations that they were a conquering force as they struggled to get home. <em>Lower Decks</em> is our first look in a while at a Starfleet dedicated to exploration, with the crew of the <em>Cerritos</em> specializing in “second contact,” that is, getting communication and trade set up with the planets that flashier ships like the Enterprise meet in their adventures.&nbsp;</p><p>So <em>Lower Decks</em> has always been a sort of commentary on the greater Star Trek philosophy, but it’s never been as blatant as Brad Boimler saying, “I didn’t join Starfleet to get in phaser fights. I signed up to explore, to be out in space making new discoveries and peaceful diplomatic solutions. That’s boldly going.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e1a5350-f94b-11eb-9f6d-8e3958dfdc6d" data-uuid="308ce374-a787-3385-9bb5-d6713edb4571"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.theonion.com/trekkies-bash-new-star-trek-film-as-fun-watchable-1819594814"><em>The Onion video</em></a> takes old school Trek fans to task for being gatekeepers, for wallowing and fetishizing things that other folks find boring. The new era of Trek has stretched the definition of what Star Trek could be, expanding into new genres and injecting a little action to sate the appetites of modern audiences. But <em>Lower Decks</em> is the first time I’ve seen pushback from within the franchise itself. The show is basically saying, “Sure, Star Trek can be exciting, but there’s a reason it became popular in the first place!” Let’s hope that with future programs like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-announcement-161152028.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>, Alex Kurtzman is listening.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f8465fe0-8c5d-4699-a3e4-02f5b297b942</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628542488</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:54:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a055ce0-f949-11eb-a4ef-a397a5ba8ad7" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a055ce0-f949-11eb-a4ef-a397a5ba8ad7" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Strange Energies" -- Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler,  Vanessa Marshall as First Officer, Jonathan Scott Frakes as Capt.

The most interesting bit is perhaps the 5-axis optical image stabilization, which uses both lens shifting and sensor shifting for maximum effect — apparently three times the angle than that of conventional optical stabilization, according to Oppo. If true, this would compensate for greater shakiness, thus allowing for faster capture and better low-light performance, even when handheld.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f85e3500-002b-11ec-bbe7-43e913aa0481" alt="OPPO comparison of 5-axis stabilization on professional camera with traditional OIS on smartphone." data-uuid="e8ab6a37-882a-3f86-bf5a-9c833a4c0056"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>This kind of implementation is nothing new in the professional camera world, but the challenge here is to miniaturize the solution and fit everything into the little remaining space on a phone. The lens, driven by ball-bearing motors, serves as the primary stabilization tool for light vibrations. For bigger movements, both the lens and sensor kick in to achieve 5-axis stabilization, with the latter&#39;s shifting and rotation controlled by shape memory alloys.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7765a5e0-0040-11ec-9fff-58587aadce44" alt="Oppo&#x002019;s 5-axis OIS shown in real-time linkage" data-uuid="e06df6ec-6618-321e-b386-13c4133753f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo admits that incorporating extra moving parts means increasing the number of potential failure points, so it will continue to conduct various drop tests and reliability tests before beginning mass production.

This will arrive in an unspecified Oppo phone sometime in Q4 of this year. The company is also working on an 85-200mm continuous optical zoom module to offer greater flexibility. It&#39;s unclear when exactly that might become commercially available.</p><p>Oppo isn&#39;t the only phone maker trying to further differentiate itself with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html">obscure</a> camera tech. To name a few, Vivo has been using its impressive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-182524376.html">micro gimbal camera</a> since its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-samsung-s20-ultra-review-comparison-153039220.html">X50 Pro</a> last year, while ASUS is well into its third-gen flip camera on its aptly named <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenfone-8-compact-flagship-flip-camera-price-availability-182205867.html">Zenfone 8 Flip</a>. Xiaomi even tried a shape-shifting &quot;liquid lens&quot; camera on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-fold-foldable-phone-liquid-lens-launch-price-availability-142220296.html">Mi Mix Fold</a>, before picking up the latest-gen under-screen camera for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-mix-4-snapdragon-888-plus-under-screen-camera-133605155.html">Mi Mix 4</a>.
