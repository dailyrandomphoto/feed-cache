The organization recently conducted an investigation where it created a series of fake accounts to test the safeguards Instagram has in place to protect young people from potentially deadly pharmaceuticals.</p><p>While hashtags like #mdma are banned on the platform, TTP found it was easy to skirt those restrictions with an account tied to a minor. Using MDMA as an example, the organization found it could employ terms like “mdmamolly” to find people who were selling the substance. In fact, the app’s search algorithm made it easy to find those hashtags, with its autocomplete feature pointing researchers in the right direction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make matters worse, once someone follows even just one account belonging to an alleged drug dealer, Instagram’s recommendation algorithm will suggest the user follow similar profiles. Despite Instagram&#39;s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119"><ins>Community Guidelines</ins></a> prohibiting “buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs,” TTP found many drug dealers operate openly on the platform.</p><p>Separately, TTP says Instagram did not take decisive action against the content it found on the platform. The organization claims it submitted 50 posts to the company for review. Of those, Instagram said 36 (or 72 percent) did not violate its Community Guidelines, despite what TTP says were “clear signs” of drug dealing activity. At the time of publishing, the company had only banned one account flagged by TTP. However, when the organization went to check on that profile, it was still up on Instagram along with all of its violating content.</p><p>“We prohibit drug sales on Instagram. We removed 1.8 million pieces of content related to drug sales in the last quarter alone, and due to our improving detection technology, the prevalence of such content is about 0.05 percent of content viewed, or about 5 views per every 10,000,” Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Meta, told Engadget. “We’ll continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”</p><p>The report comes just one day before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-adam-mosseri-congress-testify-184609082.html"><ins>Adam Mosseri</ins></a> is slated to testify to the Senate about Instagram’s impact on young users.

According to Haugen, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html"><ins>Meta, then Facebook</ins></a>, knew from its own internal research Instagram was harmful to many teens and yet the company disregarded those warnings. TTP’s findings are likely to inform some of the questions the consumer protection subcommittee asks Mosseri on Wednesday.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tech-transparency-project-report-211735946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09d23590-6192-419a-a0e5-a5b595eb1e6f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:17:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638911859</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T21:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/30e23da0-e979-11eb-bbaf-60938b4d69ff" width="4109" height="2560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/30e23da0-e979-11eb-bbaf-60938b4d69ff" width="4109" height="2560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

The company estimates the malware has infected approximately one million Windows PCs globally, which would make it one of the largest known botnets to date.</p><p>A botnet is a network of computers or internet-connected devices all infected by malware that is under the control of a single party. In this case, Google traced Glupteba to at least two individuals based out of Russia. The company is suing them in hopes it will “set a precedent, create legal and liability risks for the botnet operators, and help deter future activity.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At times, the company says it saw the network grow by about 1,000 devices per day. The malware that adds a computer to the Glupteba botnet is usually found hidden on sketchy websites that offer free software. According to Google, Glupteba’s operators used the malware to steal personal data, mine cryptocurrencies and funnel other internet traffic through the infected machines.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/07/google-glupteba-botnet-hack/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the hackers also used some of Google’s own services to distribute the malware. The company suspended more than 1,000 accounts that had been used to spread Glupteba.</p><p>“We don’t just plug security holes, we work to eliminate entire classes of threats for consumers and businesses whose work depends on the Internet,” the company said. “We have teams of analysts and security experts who are dedicated to identifying and stopping issues like DDoS, phishing campaigns, zero-day vulnerabilities, and hacking against Google, our products, and our users.”</p><p>Google coordinated with internet infrastructure providers to disrupt the botnet, but warns it has so far only succeeded in stopping it temporarily. Glupteba uses blockchain technology as a failsafe against a complete shutdown. When it doesn’t hear from its owners, the software is programmed to automatically use data encoded on the Bitcoin blockchain for instructions on how to reconnect.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Glupteba’s use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism is notable here and is becoming a more common practice among cyber crime organizations,” Google said. “The decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them that much harder to shutdown.” The company says it’s working with its partners to make the internet more resilient to such attacks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-disrupts-glupteba-botnet-202342050.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">257af264-77f4-4590-bb71-2ff6a9aadd9d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:23:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638908628</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T20:24:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley.

The <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/">Hydrasynth</a> is an unabashedly digital instrument with an impressive collection of sound design tools and a proprietary keyboard that has polyphonic aftertouch. For those looking to leave behind the warm but staid world of analog for the complex frontiers of digital, it’s pretty alluring. But, while its $1,299 list price isn’t absurd given the feature set, it’s also out range for many hobbyists. Even the desktop model, which ditches the keyboard in favor of 24 pads, is slightly pricey at $799.</p><p>The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hydrasynth Explorer" href="https://fave.co/332xGHn">Hydrasynth Explorer</a>, however, is expressly designed to get ASM’s keyboard and synth engine in the hands of as many people as possible. And it’s “portable” to boot. (Although, as I’ll get to later, the company’s definition of portable is highly questionable.) Of course to reach the more attainable price of $599, some things had to be sacrificed. But the good news is, most of what’s missing amounts to minor conveniences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before we go any further, let’s set some expectations: I cannot possibly cover every feature of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asm-hydrasynth-explorer-superbooth-wavemorphing-portable-191358134.html">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> in detail. Even the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface. If you’re looking for an exhaustive walkthrough, I highly recommend Loopop’s nearly hour-long tutorial on the original <a href="https://youtu.be/-rJd_j9_Ixs">Hydrasynths</a> and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfuTU1hdMV4">half-hour long follow-up</a> looking at what’s different on the Explorer and Deluxe.</p><p>The most important thing you need to know is that the core of the Hydrasynth — its wavemorphing engine — remains unchanged and it&#39;s running on the same hardware. So the Explorer still has eight-note polyphony, with three oscillators per voice, and over 200 waveforms to choose from. The first two oscillators can be static or in “wavescan” mode, which simply means you can choose up to eight waveforms at a time to morph between. While you can’t import your own custom wavetables, you can essentially build your own from the pre-approved ingredients.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb493-5782-11ec-a4fe-eb5d1ebaf4f6" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="2f77867c-9d36-385a-b11e-c33b0c77d2d2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Those oscillators can be combined and manipulated using what ASM calls Mutators — two each for oscillators one and two. There are eight different Mutators to choose from, ranging from classic FM (frequency modulation) and hard sync, to the slightly more exotic PhazDiff, and even three different flavors of pulse width modulation.</p><p>The third oscillator is a much simpler affair. It’s a static wave and it can’t be sent through a Mutator, but it can still add depth to a sound. The most obvious use is as a sub-oscillator to add a little bass, but it can also be fed through the ring modulator. Which, by the way: Yes, there is a ring modulator and a noise source as well.</p><p>There are also two filters, which can be in series or parallel, and you can control how much of each oscillator goes to which filter. The first filter has 16 different modes, ranging from classic 12db low pass to a speech-like vowel filter, while the second sweep from low pass, through bandpass or notch, and into high pass.</p><div id="undefined"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1173556741%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-2DxwFFku5Fu&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/hydrasynth-explorer-sound-samples/s-2DxwFFku5Fu" title="Hydrasynth Explorer sound samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Hydrasynth Explorer sound samples</a></div></div><p>To control all these various parts, you’ve got five six-stage envelopes and five LFOs that all feed into a 32-slot modulation matrix. In total there are 29 modulation sources and 155 destinations. It’s a lot of variables to contend with. Frankly, it can feel overwhelming, and that’s even before you start digging into the effects and voice options like “density.”</p><p>The good news is, to get started with the Hydrasynth you don’t need to master its sound design tools, you can just dig into the presets. The stock sounds are pretty solid and cover a wide range of styles, though it does especially excel at icy ambience, strings and plucky keys. But even navigating those can be daunting, especially as some of them start to sound indistinguishable. There’s a grand total of 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. Scrolling through them one by one with the large patch knob can get tedious. But if you turn your attention to the small OLED to the right of the “Main Systems” section, you can use the encoders there to filter presets by category, such as brass, ambient or e-piano. There’s also a favorites menu, where you bookmark 32 of your most used patches.</p><section data-eng-breakout="23555ad0c11b45bb82127fd3a9d71424" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88301420-5782-11ec-af5e-e23f58862d8b" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p><em>(I do want to briefly pause here, to nitpick about the layout of the Hydrasynth Explorer, especially because this isn’t an issue on other models. The Keyboard, Desktop and Deluxe versions all have their displays in a single line. But the Explorer has them staggered, with the navigation display being below and to the left of the parameter display on the right. The right display is significantly smaller and more cramped on the Explorer, but that’s less of an issue than the alignment, which means your eyes have to move much further when going back and forth. It’s doubly frustrating since the solution is simple: move the large patch knob from above the left display, to below it. This would have the added benefit of making it easier to see the left OLED when browsing patches since your hand wouldn’t be blocking it.)</em></p><p>Now, while there’s absolutely nothing wrong with playing presets (I am mostly a tweak-a-preset guy myself), you would be underutilizing the Hydrasynth if you didn’t explore its depths. And while it’s an incredibly complex instrument no matter how you slice it, ASM deserves credit for making the interface as clear and intuitive as possible. The Hydrasynth is far from being knob-per-function, but a lot of work was done to minimize menu diving.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88303b30-5782-11ec-bf91-76292281c3d5" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="df47fffa-25b5-33fc-af4d-19a330d7d7bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The front panel is divided up into neatly labeled sections: arpeggiator, filer controls, main systems, master controls and module select. In each of these sections are easy-to-read buttons, often with just one function, plus some knobs. And, by the way, all of those buttons and knobs are a delight to use. This is an incredibly well made instrument and while some sacrifices were made to reach the $599 price, build quality was not one of them.</p><p>You’ll spend most of your time at the bottom of the Master Control and Module Select section where there are 26 buttons for the various parts of the signal chain. The leftmost buttons are where you select which oscillator to modify. When you press the OSC 1 button, the right screen brings up the options for that module and you change the parameters with the endless encoders at the four corners of the display. The up and down arrows to the right scroll through the pages of settings.</p><p>For the oscillators, there are only two pages and you’ll only really need to venture to the second one in Wavescan mode. That’s where you’ll find the “wavelist edit” option. Press that and you’ll open the menu to select the sounds for your wavetable. All you do is turn the knobs next to each parameter for Wav 1, Wav 2, etcetera until you’re happy with your selection. You can pick up to eight, but you’re not required to. What makes the Hydrasynth somewhat unique is that you’re not just picking a set of static wave shapes to switch between, but as you change the position of the Wavescan it will morph from to the other seamlessly.  Which means if you move through those eight shapes slowly, you can get a lot of movement out of just a single oscillator.</p><p>To set the sound for the second and third oscillators, the process is the same.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c6a77f9b15684354a8afb6470785ab8a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882e3f60-5782-11ec-b7d7-fa52d1ff5116" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p>As you move from left to right in the signal chain you’ll next encounter the Mutant 1-4 buttons. Press one and the OLED on the right brings up the parameters. (Noticing a trend?) Depending on what Mutator you select using the top left encoder you’ll see different options here to control. But at its most basic, you just turn one knob to choose, say PWM, then another set the wet/dry value you want.</p><p>There are eight different Mutators to choose from, but I want to focus briefly on PW-ASM, or Pulse Width ASM. There are two things that make pulse width modulation special on the Hydrasynth. One, you can use it on any waveshape — usually PWM is associated with square waves. And two: in ASM mode you can create your own custom pulse width patterns. PW-ASM breaks a wave into eight distinct sections and you dial in the amount of modulation around each of the slice points. It’s not exactly the easiest thing to explain, but suffice to say I don’t know of any other synths out there with this feature. (If you do, please tell me in the comments.)</p><p>Under the Mutants is the button to bring up the ring modulation and noise parameters, and then as you follow the line illustrating the signal chain to the right, you see they all feed into the mixer. Here you can dial in the volume of each oscillator, the ring mod and noise section, as well as panning for each. And this is also where you’ll decide how much of each to send to which filter and whether the filters are in series or parallel. This is one of the sections with the most pages of options to scroll through, but it’s still straightforward. Just press the up and down buttons next to the display until you see the parameter you want, then turn the knob next to it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882f02b0-5782-11ec-affb-9ac63e93fb92" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="da117142-d6b9-3f9a-8050-f8af73880a2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>After the mixer, you’ll see the signal chain branches off again with your envelopes (ENV) along the top, LFOs along the bottom and down the middle your audio signal, including filters, amp and effects.</p><p>By default ENV 1 and LFO 1 are connected to the filters, while ENV 2 and LFO 2 are connected to the amp. There’s no way to break the connection between ENV 2 and the amp, it will <em>always</em> define the total volume of your sound. That doesn’t mean you can’t control the volume of the oscillators separately; it just means you have to get creative.</p><p>So if you wanted OSC 2 to come in slightly after OSC 1 you could use ENV 3 to control it, just with a slightly longer attack time than ENV 2. To make the connection you could press the mod matrix button at the top and scroll through all the options. But the easier way is to hold the ENV 3 button, then press the mixer button. Then those two modules will be automatically connected and all you have to do is pick the parameter you want (OSC2CVol in this case) and dial in the depth. It’s also worth mentioning that the Hydrasynth’s envelopes have six stages — delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain and release — as opposed to the more common ADSR. That means you can actually delay the start of the envelope for a certain amount of time after a key press.</p><p>Even more interesting are the LFOs. While you can use them to create whooshing filter sounds and gentle pitch warbles, you can also use them as a sequencer. Step mode lets you create a customized modulation pattern of up to 64 steps.</p><p>On the fourth page of the LFO settings, though, you’ll find the SemiLock option — this is where the magic happens. See, Hydrasynth doesn’t have a proper sequencer, but you can use the LFOs locked to semitones thanks to the latest firmware. So, with fairly minimal work, OSC 2 could come in behind OSC 1 and play melody over a pad. This is just one example of how to use this power. You can sequence anything from filter cutoff to the wet/dry mix on the reverb to the detune or glide time, or even the parameters of the Mutators. This level of control opens a whole world of possibilities.</p><p>At the end of the signal chain you have four effects slots to work with: one pre-fx, one post-fx and sandwiched between them are dedicated delay and reverb modules. There are a few different varieties of the latter two. The reverse delay is excellent, and while the plate and hall reverbs are solid, cloud is my favorite setting.</p><p>The post- and pre-fx sections have the same options to choose from, including phaser, distortion, compression, rotary, tremolo and more. But my favorite to stick at the end of almost every patch is Lo-Fi. You can turn down the sample rate to get some crushed digital sounds and there are various filter types to choose from that give you the quality of something being played through a phone or over a radio. It’s just a nice touch to keep everything from getting too crisp and clean.</p><p>Here’s the thing: This is only just scratching the surface of what the Hydrasynth is capable of. There are a number of options in the Voice menu for adding depth and warmth, like the sort of vague Analog Feel. There’s an incredibly capable arpeggiator with eight different modes. There’s a macro section where you can assign multiple parameters to a single knob to dramatically transform sounds in a performance-friendly way. And I barely even mentioned the keyboard which has polyphonic aftertouch — something basically unheard of at this price point.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb494-5782-11ec-a6fd-aecd6921d416" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="01513a55-07dc-3a1a-8045-8becf659a74a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Hydrasynth Explorer, at least under the hood, is virtually indistinguishable from it’s larger counterpart the Hydrasynth Keys, which costs almost twice as much. So what are you giving up here? Well, one the Explorer has mini keys instead of full-sized ones, but that might not be a con for some people like myself with small hands and limited piano skills. There’s also no proper pitch and mod wheels, instead you get touchstrips; they’re fine, but not nearly as accurate. The biggest loss is the reduced number of controls. The filter knobs have been reduced from five to three, and there’s only four macro / parameter knobs, versus eight on the larger models. But honestly, these are minor sacrifices to reach this price.</p><p>The one last thing to address is that ASM calls the Hydrasynth Explorer “portable,” but that’s only true in the most technical of senses. In addition to the included AC adapter you can power it with eight AA batteries — which is not a trivial amount — for three to four hours. Plus, the Explorer weighs 7.5 pounds and it’s nearly 22 inches long. Sure, that’s petite compared to the 22 pounds and 32 inches of the Hydrasynth Keys, but this is not something that you’re gonna toss in a backpack and bring to the park on a whim. While it’s easy enough to toss in the trunk and bring to a jam session, that ASM doesn’t include or sell a travel case for it, kind of undermines the portability pitch.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c0c7110991a54cc19f0c9b64be0d4a8f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb491-5782-11ec-bcec-2c91fbe5922b" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p>So no, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Explorer" href="https://fave.co/332xGHn">Explorer</a> isn’t really what I’d call “portable,” but that doesn’t matter. Even if this thing never left your studio it would be worth the money. It sounds great (as long as you can accept that it sounds obviously digital), it’s solidly built, and it has an almost bottomless set of sound design tools to explore. It’s possible to just get lost building patches on the Hydrasynth — and not in an annoying menu-diving way. If you’ve got the money, the larger Keys with more hands-on controls will almost certainly save you some headaches, but the Hydrasynth Explorer might be the most synth you can get for under $600.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">286605bb-3572-434a-b39e-f31ce64fc430</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 18:30:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638913870</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T21:51:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb491-5782-11ec-bcec-2c91fbe5922b" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88308951-5782-11ec-abf4-d18bc8813c29" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard workers stage walkout over Call of Duty studio layoffs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Employees and contractors at Activision Blizzard are walking out of work today in support of their colleagues at Raven Software. The protest, the third such <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html"><ins>work stoppage</ins></a> to hit the company since it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sued by California</ins></a> over sexual harassment allegations in July, comes after Raven, one of the studios that supports Activision’s incredibly popular Call of Duty franchise, laid off 12 quality assurance contractors. The action started on Monday when 60 workers at Raven Software, including both full-time employees and contractors, left work to protest the surprise terminations.</p><p>The protest has no planned end date, a first for the walkouts at Activision Blizzard. Those involved in the action are demanding the publisher hire all QA contractors, including those who lost their jobs on Friday, as full-time employees. “Those participating in this demonstration do so with the continued success of the studio at the forefront of their mind,” said Blizzard Activision worker advocacy group A Better ABK on Twitter. “The Raven QA department is essential to the day-to-day functioning of the studio as a whole. Terminating the contracts of high performing testers in a time of consistent work and profit puts the health of the studio at risk.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2b6dcddf15914b69aff8cab3ccce27a7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">To our leadership, we hope you&#39;ll abide by our policy to lead responsibly.

The developer told approximately 30 percent of the team their contracts would end on January 28th, with more still waiting to find if they’ll have a job beyond the start of the year. According to A Better ABK, every worker Raven decided not to keep was in “good standing,” which is to say they had not underperformed in their job or committed a fireable offense.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/06/raven-software-walkout/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a>, Raven studio head Brian Raffel said during an all-hands meeting on Monday he didn’t consider the terminations as layoffs. Instead, he said the studio had merely decided not to renew the contracts of those who were let go. Raffel reportedly later apologized for his comments.</p><p>“We are converting approximately 500 temporary workers to full-time employees in the coming months,” an Activision Blizzard spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1467892585637167108?s=20"><ins>told </ins><em><ins>Bloomberg’s</ins></em><ins> Jason Schreier</ins></a> in response to the layoffs. “Unfortunately, as part of this change, we also have notified 20 temporary workers across studios that their contracts would not be extended.” The move comes after the publisher posted a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-02-king-blizzard-push-activision-blizzard-to-q3-growth"><ins>net income of $639</ins></a> million during its most recent fiscal quarter.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Activision Blizzard for additional comment.</p><p>This latest action isn’t directly related to the misconduct claims that have left Activision Blizzard in turmoil for months — though it’s likely safe to say frustrations across the company are at a boiling point. The first walkout occurred in July shortly after the company issued an “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html"><ins>abhorrent and insulting</ins></a>”  response to the harassment lawsuit from California&#39;s fair employment regulator. More recently, employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html"><ins>staged a second action</ins></a> after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a> published a bombshell report on Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick’s handling of the crisis. That article implicated Kotick in the mistreatment that has characterized the company’s work culture for years.

Over the last four years, the company has recruited a small army of artists, developers and other AR enthusiasts to help build out its massive library of in-app AR effects.</p><p>Now Snap is tapping lens creators — it has more than 250,000 — to help it make AR more useful. The company is releasing new tools that allow artists and developers to essentially make mini apps inside of their lenses. And it’s working on getting its latest AR innovation into more of  their hands: its next-generation Spectacles, which have AR displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The goal, according to Sophia Dominguez, Snap’s head of AR platform partnerships, is to expand the ways AR can be used, while keeping those experiences firmly rooted in the real world — not the metaverse.  “You don&#39;t want to escape into another world,” she says of Snap’s philosophy. “To us, the world around us is magical, and there&#39;s things to learn from it.” Instead, she says, the company is looking to enable experiences that can “bridge” digital spaces and physical ones, and create “more useful applications” for AR.</p><p>For now, Snap is leaving it up to creators to figure out exactly what a “useful” augmented reality lens is, but the company is introducing a number of new tools to help them build it. At its annual Lens Fest event, Snap is also introducing a new version of Lens Studio, the software that allows developers to create and publish lenses inside of Snapchat.</p><p>The latest version includes new APIs that allow AR creators to connect their effects to real-time information. The resulting lenses are almost like mini apps inside Snapchat lenses. For example, creators can build lenses with real-time translation capabilities via iTranslate. Or check on their preferred cryptocurrency with a lens powered by crypto platform FTX. Weather data (via Accuweather) and stock market info (from Alpaca) will also be available, and the company is planning to add more partners in the near future.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b2e57340-5773-11ec-befa-b40598f20f21" alt="New APIs available in Snapchat&#39;s Lens Studio software." data-uuid="e751a452-c4cc-3a6e-a732-09ab27d99635"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snap</div></figure><p>These kinds of lenses are even more intriguing in the context of Snapchat’s augmented reality glasses, its “next-gen” Spectacles. Snap first showed off the glasses earlier this year, saying that the device would only be available to a small number of AR creators and developers. Since then, the company has handed out its latest Specs to hundreds of creators, who have been helping Snap figure out how far they can push the tech, and what kinds of new experiences AR glasses can enable.</p><p>That’s because with Spectacles, a “lens” doesn’t just have to be something that goes on top of a selfie — it can add contextual information to the world around you. For example, one creator experimenting with Spectacles recently showed off a concept where staring out a train window can surface details about where you are and what the weather is.</p><div id="c970f5f5e80c488d95484e8b8356fc30"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On a train trip today, I wanted to know what cities I&#39;m passing by, so I created an <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AR</a> lens for <a href="https://twitter.com/Spectacles?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Spectacles</a> to tell me where I am. <a href="https://t.co/98Wud3i7K3">pic.twitter.com/98Wud3i7K3</a></p>— Vova Kurbatov (@V_Kurbatov) <a href="https://twitter.com/V_Kurbatov/status/1465311637771071490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Nike created a Spectacles lens that allows runners to follow an AR pigeon along their route, and view different animations along the way.</p><div id="83a8f5bdc478401e89428db830f8a420"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nike + <a href="https://twitter.com/Snapchat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@snapchat</a> AR = no more boring runs. <br><br>What do you think <a href="https://twitter.com/EliudKipchoge?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EliudKipchoge</a>? 🏃‍♀️🏃 <a href="https://t.co/dB0Ik91DZB">pic.twitter.com/dB0Ik91DZB</a></p>— Nike.com (@nikestore) <a href="https://twitter.com/nikestore/status/1456614947056717826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 5, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Creator Brielle Garcia, who has also been experimenting with Spectacles, recently previewed a concept for an AR menu that allows users to view 3D models of meals on a restaurant menu. Other creators are experimenting with interactive shopping and gaming lenses.</p><p>“When you think about what&#39;s gonna get people to put glasses on their face every single day, those are the things today you’re checking your apps for,” Dominguez said. “We’re really excited to see the different UIs that people can create in augmented reality with this kind of utility.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/93ea5920-5772-11ec-9cff-3072947a321e" alt="A concept for a 3D interactive menu with Snapchat&#39;s AR Spectacles." data-uuid="a6aa6007-ac62-324f-acd7-373c96090bf2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snap</div></figure><p>All that comes with an important caveat: the reason why the AR Spectacles aren’t for sale and likely won’t be anytime soon is due to some pretty significant hardware limitations. Battery life is extremely limited (the charging case provides four extra charges) and the glasses themselves are, well, ugly.</p><p>While previous iterations of Spectacles look and feel like sunglasses, the next-gen Specs are comically large. Every time I see them, all I can think of is the chunky black frames worn by Roddy Piper <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they-live-sunglasses">in They Live</a>. And, after spending some time wearing them, I can confirm that they are even more ridiculous looking when you put them on your face.</p><p>That said, Snap has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html">been clear</a> from the get-go that this version isn’t intended to look good, or even like something people will want to buy. Rather, the goal is to enable new types of AR development.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="2617f188-3ea0-4e6b-8bad-020f5daf3215"/><p>And, despite the looks, their capabilities are impressive.The frames are equipped with “3D waveguides,” which power the AR displays; as well as dual cameras, speakers and microphones. On the left side is a capture button, so you can snap a photo or video of your surroundings, and on the right is a “scan” button. Much like the feature of the same name in the Snapchat app, scanning can help you find lenses based on your surroundings.</p><p>I only got to experiment with a handful of AR lenses while wearing the Specs, but the process was strikingly similar to using lenses in Snapchat’s app. I was able to scroll through a selection of lenses by swiping along a touchpad on the outside of the frames. Then, you can place the lens into your surroundings to see the AR effects around you. Like other AR headsets, the field of view is  narrow enough that it’s not fully immersive, but I was impressed by the resolution and brightness of what I saw.</p><p>“&#39;I’ve worked on each generation of Spectacles and this one is by far the most fun,” says David Meisenholder, a senior product designer at Snap, pointing to the company’s close collaboration with its creator community. “We&#39;re also learning how much we need to go to make those perfect for the consumer glasses of the future.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-is-hoping-lens-creators-can-make-augmented-reality-useful-163817246.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30cd12db-f21a-419b-8d2c-2b66a758e85e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638895099</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T16:38:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5758540-5779-11ec-a9fd-9b3108f5e6b8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5758540-5779-11ec-a9fd-9b3108f5e6b8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat wants creators to build more 'useful' augmented reality.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Snap useful AR ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW will help recreate 'Rocket League' in real life for charity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You probably won&#39;t see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-ford-mustang-mach-e-ev-shelby-gt-350-r-180040475.html"><em>Rocket League&#39;s</em></a> flying cars in the real world any time soon, but BMW and esports brand LVL might offer the next best thing.

The tool allows community owners to gate access to part or all of their server behind a monthly subscription fee. It’s something the company’s growing number of users, particularly admins and mods, have been asking it to implement for a while. Before today, those individuals had to turn to third-party services like Patreon to monetize access to their servers.</p><p>By contrast, the Premium Memberships tool creates a streamlined interface for that same purpose. A new tab under the “Community” heading in the app’s setting’s menu allows server owners to do things like set price tiers and view related analytics. The feature similarly streamlines the process of signing up for paid channels for users. If you want to support a community, you don’t need to leave Discord to do so. When you tap on a premium channel, indicated by the new “sparkle” icon in the sidebar, the client will tell how much you need to pay for access, as well as what perks you’ll gain for doing so.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/da1e5800-5773-11ec-ab3e-50db057e408c" style="height:1133;width:1600;" alt="Discord Premium Memberships" data-uuid="69fd8975-211c-3632-8118-edd522bbfee1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Discord</div></figure><p>As for pricing, Discord says it will encourage server owners to experiment. As a baseline, the company will recommend a monthly fee of $2.99 as a minimum and $99.99 as a maximum. When it comes to most of the channels you visit, you probably won’t pay more than $5 or $10 a month for access. The top end of the price range is a reflection of how much Discord has changed since the start of the pandemic to accommodate a more diverse group of communities. Discord <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-rebranding-151953314.html">isn’t exclusively a place for gaming anymore</a>.</p><p>“Access to a channel can seem simplistic, but it’s a foundational piece that someone can build a lot of flexibility on top of,” said Jesse Wofford, group product marketing manager at Discord, in an interview with Engadget. One of the server owners the company is working with on this week’s soft launch is someone who runs gaming bootcamps. According to Wofford, they’ve built an entire business around private lessons. The company wants to give those people the opportunity to create a sustainable business on its platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever someone decides to charge for access to their channels, the company plans to take a 10 percent cut of the subscription. “It&#39;s an important stake in the ground for us that this product, like a lot of other ones, is built around creator success,” Wofford said. Additionally, for people who want to continue to use services like Patreon to monetize their channels, Discord won’t stop them from doing so. “One of the important things here is that we’re still investing in those relationships,” said Wofford. “We want to create an ecosystem that gives creators as many options to succeed as possible.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b268f040-5773-11ec-bfd5-9432ce0d0309" style="height:1138;width:1600;" alt="Discord Premium Memberships" data-uuid="eea2733d-9fa0-3310-99fc-35f59a4d21b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Discord</div></figure><p>Premium Memberships is something Discord has been working on for a while. “There’s probably a world where we could have released this a while ago,” Wofford told me. “We wanted to make sure we took in the right feedback from a diverse set of creators and built it in a way that we felt confident would deliver value.” To that end, the company plans to take its time testing the feature before it rolls it out more widely.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/discord-premium-memberships-announcement-160019679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68dfd6f5-36b7-401a-ab75-e0daa1ea0c87</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 16:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638892636</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T15:57:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/93e42220-5773-11ec-bdbd-d574ba91490d" width="1600" height="1138" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/93e42220-5773-11ec-bdbd-d574ba91490d" width="1600" height="1138" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Discord]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Discord Premium Memberships]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Discord Premium Memberships]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hubble telescope is fully operational again after a month-long nap]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s Hubble telescope has been in a &quot;coma&quot; since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-telescope-recovering-from-system-failure-151249317.html">going into system failure</a> in late October — but today, the agency <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-returns-hubble-to-full-science-operations">announced</a> that it is waking Hubble up.

The platform only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/the-new-new-slack-quill/">launched this past February</a>, but today Twitter has announce it is purchasing Quill and shutting it down this weekend. Twitter&#39;s tech GM Nick Caldwell announced the move this morning, and Quill <a href="https://quill.chat/updates/2021-12-07-quill-twitter/">confirmed the news</a> in a blog post on its own site.</p><div id="48148a1901454c398c93e18fdd2bc6b1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Excited to share that today we’re welcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/QuillChat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@QuillChat</a> to Twitter! 👋🏿👋🏿🪶🪶</p>— Nick Caldwell🔪🧼 (@nickcald) <a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1468221427354517504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The fact that it&#39;s shutting down this weekend is a stunningly fast turn-around; Quill is offering details on how to export data, which any team using it will probably want to do ASAP. (They&#39;ll also want to go and find a new messaging service to use post-haste.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app had billed itself as &quot;messaging for people that focus,&quot; and it&#39;s not clear how that mission will continue as part of Twitter. Caldwell said that the goal was to have the Quill team help &quot;make messaging tools like DMs a more useful &amp; expressive way people can have conversations.&quot; Chances are good this is more of an acqui-hire situation, in which Twitter wanted to have the Quill team working on Twitter&#39;s existing products. Given how fast Quill is shutting down, it&#39;s pretty clear Twitter doesn&#39;t have any interest in spending resources on that existing product.</p><p>It&#39;s the second major acquisition Twitter has made in the last month or so — in mid-November, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-threader-194631446.html">Twitter purchased Threader</a>, a popular tool that pulled threads of tweets together into an easier to read format. Just like the Quill purchase, Twitter didn&#39;t waste much time shutting down Threader — the app is set to disappear on December 15th. (At least it got a longer lease on life than Quill.) Threader is expected to be rolled into the Twitter Blue subscription service; we&#39;ll have to see if some of Quill&#39;s legacy ends up there, as well.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-purchases-quill-messaging-service-153151449.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80911ee2-4a6d-4730-be9d-fb157ecea0eb</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 15:31:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638890160</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T15:16:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c9788d30-576f-11ec-b377-eb768af176e8" width="1426" height="846" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c9788d30-576f-11ec-b377-eb768af176e8" width="1426" height="846" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Quill]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Quill messaging service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Quill messaging service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A hacker named Bowser agrees to pay Nintendo $10 million to settle a civil piracy suit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A Canadian hacker named Gary Bowser (yes, like Mario&#39;s nemesis) has agreed to pay the company $10 million to settle <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-bowser-lawsuit-switch-hacks-205618404.html"><ins>a civil piracy lawsuit</ins></a>.

A Rohingya woman has filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of refugees against Facebook parent company Meta, alleging the company both amplified anti-Rohingya hate speech through its algorithms and failed to remove content fostering violence. The refugees ask for over $150 billion in damages.</p><p>The plaintiffs argued that Facebook only took meaningful action against pro-genocide factions after it was pushed. The Myanmar military launched its purge of Rohingya in 2017, with officials and nationalist monks spreading slurs and misinformation on Facebook to either justify or cover up atrocities. Facebook only started cracking down in August 2018 following a UN report linking unchecked behavior on the social network to real-world violence. The company requested an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html">independent audit</a> at the same time that reached a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html">similar conclusion</a>. This was too little too late, according to the refugees — the company admitted it &quot;should and could have done more&quot; only after mass displacements and deaths.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta has already declined to comment on the lawsuit. A similar complaint is expected in the UK in 2022.</p><p>The firm was quick to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-limiting-myanmar-military-reach-065458912.html">clamp down on the Myanmar military</a> following its February 2021 coup, and went so far as to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-takes-down-myanmar-military-page-160843607.html">pull the military&#39;s main page</a>. However,  that swifter response won&#39;t help much with a lawsuit over past actions. While it&#39;s too soon to say whether or not the lawsuit will succeed, let alone obtain the hoped-for damages, the company may have a difficult time defending itself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rohingya-lawsuit-facebook-meta-genocide-150644112.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ce3889f-ac31-417d-b5ae-35a8eabcf6a1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 15:06:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638889608</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T15:06:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9483db00-5767-11ec-abcb-58e872336e1a" width="3856" height="2560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9483db00-5767-11ec-abcb-58e872336e1a" width="3856" height="2560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Beawiharta Beawiharta / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A protester holds a placard during protest against Myanmar's treatment of its Rohingya Muslim minority in front of Myanmar's embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, December 5, 2018.

These are the &quot;classic&quot; style AirPods that made Apple&#39;s earbuds some of the most popular in the wireless audio space. Their kicker is the H1 chipset inside that allows them to quickly pair and switch between Apple devices. Not only do they connect to your iPhone in seconds, but they can also switch to, say, your MacBook while you watch a YouTube video pretty seamlessly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EarPods-like design of these buds will be great for some, but a bit cumbersome for others. That&#39;s one of the improvements Apple made with its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:third-gen earbuds" href="https://amzn.to/3GrWx69">third-gen earbuds</a>, but those come in at $179. The second-gen models have decent sound quality and a good battery life, too — you&#39;ll get around five hours of use before they need more power, and you can get more than 24 hours of total listening time after a few recharges with the included case. Overall, they may not have some of the newer bells and whistles you&#39;ll find on the latest AirPods, but these make a good pair of wireless earbuds for Apple users on a budget.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-second-generation-airpods-are-back-on-sale-for-100-133533441.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f510e1b-76bb-4eb6-8ef5-969cbeca9807</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 13:35:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638884135</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T13:35:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony stops producing its new ZV-E10 camera due to chip shortages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony only just launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html">ZV-E10</a> mirrorless vlogging camera in July, but as of December 3rd, it has suspended orders and ceased production due to the ongoing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chip%20shortage/">chip shortage</a>, Sony Japan <a href="https://www.sony.jp/ichigan/info2/20211203.html">announced</a>. The company added that a resumption of production and sales will depend upon &quot;the status of parts supply,&quot; and that interested buyers should keep an eye on the camera&#39;s <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10l-b">product page</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 was released as a more capable follow-up to the popular, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-zv-1-vlogging-camera-review-162822651.html">compact ZV-1</a> vlogging camera, thanks to the option to change lenses. It&#39;s essentially a reworked A6100 model with a flip-out display, no electronic viewfinder (EVF), a high-quality built-in three-capsule microphone and a button that makes it easy to switch from video to still photography.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony has also paused production of the A7 II, A6400 and A6100 cameras. The latter two are fairly recent models, but the A7 II originally launched in 2014 — so it&#39;s hard to see a particular pattern.&nbsp;</p><p>Cameras aren&#39;t the only Sony products affected by semiconductor shortages. Sony also reportedly reduced PS5 production, something that might put its delivery target of 14.8 million consoles by March 2022 in jeopardy. Sony and TSMC recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-tsmc-confirm-japan-factory-chip-shortage-153515725.html">announced</a> that they&#39;d team up on a chip factory in Japan for specialized chips used in cars, cameras and other gadgets. However, the plant won&#39;t come online until 2024 at the earliest, so it&#39;ll do nothing to help Sony or anyone else, anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-suspends-orders-for-the-new-zv-e-10-because-of-shortages-132051883.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ac8e72b5-8706-46e6-8aaf-739e8eaf1e60</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 13:20:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638882962</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T13:16:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d2e798c0-5756-11ec-beff-c160986f0d69" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d2e798c0-5756-11ec-beff-c160986f0d69" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony suspends orders for the new ZV-E10 because of chip shortages]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony suspends orders for the new ZV-E10 because of chip shortages]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
