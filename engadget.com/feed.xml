Epic has signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">Eyes Out</a>, the brand-spanking-new studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-05-road-not-taken-review-take-it.html">Spry Fox</a>, a veteran, award-winning indie developer known for heartwarming games such as <em>Cozy Grove</em>, <em>Alphabear</em> and <em>Road Not Taken</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a publisher, Epic offers to cover 100 percent of all development costs, and once a game comes out and breaks even in sales, the signed studio receives at least 50 percent of all profits. Epic doesn&#39;t exert creative control over its partnered games, and the developers retain the intellectual property rights to their work. Epic signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-epic-publishing-remedy-playdead-gendesign-games.html">Remedy Entertainment, Playdead and genDESIGN</a> in March 2020, and today&#39;s announcement marks the second batch of contracted studios.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’re open to publishing many types of games from the most talented developers, and the studios we’re partnering with are making some of the coolest, experimental and ambitious stuff out there,&quot; head of Epic Games Publishing Hector Sanchez told Engadget. &quot;They have our full support – including Epic’s publishing and promotional services, resources, and experience – which means they can focus solely on making the best games possible.&quot;</p><p>Eyes Out is staffed with enormous creative energy, but it&#39;s unproven as a team. Davis, Finck and their collaborators are working on their debut title, a mysterious arthouse horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio and cosmic terror. The studio&#39;s teasers are filled with moody desert landscapes and unsettling layers of sound. In a chat <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">with Engadget in September</a>, Davis said he wants to &quot;create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality.&quot;</p><div id="2b6cc08eb69141a8ac2dbf86eb82c535"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moPq2z_jYTg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The publisher relationship goes even deeper for Eyes Out, too — the studio received an Epic MegaGrant in 2019, which gave them the runway to build their first proof-of-concept. Epic further funded the studio&#39;s prototype, allowing them to expand their team in the process. And now, Eyes Out is officially part of Epic Games Publishing.</p><p>&quot;From the very beginning, Robin and I knew that Eyes Out was going to require a unique publishing partner willing to empower our vision of the strange, ambitious worlds we would create together, and one capable of fueling it,&quot; Davis said about today&#39;s news. He continued, &quot;Our collaboration with Epic continued to bear fruit. Working with Epic is really the first time I’ve felt entirely unleashed as a director, both technically and creatively. Together we’re aimed to create the thing that’s closest to my heart.&quot;</p><p>Spry Fox, meanwhile, is working on its most ambitious project to date, which <a href="https://twitter.com/spryfox/status/1450850917696229380">it describes</a> as a &quot;non-violent multiplayer game designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world.&quot; It&#39;ll come to multiple platforms, and support cross-play and cross-progression. The first bit of concept art from Spry Fox&#39;s new game depicts a pastel, <em>Atlantis</em>-esque world with a massive yellow whale floating across the sky.</p><p>&quot;This is the first time in our history that we at Spry Fox have chosen to work with a publisher in this manner,&quot; studio co-founder and CEO David Edery said. &quot;Up until now, we have only worked with publishers for much more limited regional publishing and porting arrangements. But we felt for a project as ambitious as this one, we needed more support than usual, and Epic seemed like the right company to provide that support.&quot;</p><div id="f319868e23a24922806eb34b01261e3f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce that we&#39;re working on our next and most ambitious game with the wonderful folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGamesPub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EpicGamesPub</a>! It&#39;s a non-violent multiplayer game designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world 🥰 <a href="https://t.co/mmTMYLijwF">https://t.co/mmTMYLijwF</a><a href="https://t.co/SPVPPujsku">pic.twitter.com/SPVPPujsku</a></p>— Spry Fox (@spryfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/spryfox/status/1450850917696229380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Epic has positioned itself as the developer&#39;s publisher, with a goal of having &quot;the most developer-friendly terms in the industry,&quot; emphasizing creative control and financial support for its studios. Epic also offers free access to Unreal Engine, a powerful game-development toolset, and it throws money at artists through programs like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrants</a>, a $100 million fund for burgeoning creatives. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-epic-games-store-steam-competition.html">Epic Games Store</a> went live in 2018 as a direct competitor to Steam, offering better financial terms for developers and challenging Valve to implement the same deal (spoiler: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-18-half-life-alyx-valve-steam-stockholders-boo.html">Valve didn&#39;t</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Epic waged a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-xcloud-app-store-130053155.html">very public</a> legal battle against Apple, arguing the iPhone-maker enjoyed monopolistic control over the App Store and offered unfair terms to developers. In the end, the lawsuit played out like any other fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-apple-google-indie-developers-app-store-210830045.html">between multibillion-dollar corporations</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">little change</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html">lots of press</a>.</p><p>Throughout the lawsuit, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple for engaging in greedy, anti-consumer and anti-developer practices. This is kind of his thing — since founding Epic more than 30 years ago, Sweeney has been consistent in his mantra that game development should be accessible to as many people as possible. Even his first game, <em>ZZT</em>, included an editor so everyone who played it could build their own levels.</p><p>&quot;It was in those early days that Epic&#39;s kind of core philosophy was set,&quot; Sweeney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-20-fortnite-250-million-epic-games-sweeney-interview-gdc.html">told Engadget in 2019</a>. &quot;We both build games ourselves and we share all the results of our work with the world to build their own games. We&#39;re the both a game developer and a service company that works with partners throughout the whole industry. Everything we&#39;re doing now is this much larger version of that.&quot;</p><p>Including, it seems, Epic Games Publishing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-publishing-spry-fox-eyes-out-183420656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f0cbd79-557f-47b4-bffc-f7ac4fcb255f</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:34:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634754864</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T18:34:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a1bc5410-31d2-11ec-979f-31125d4581ff" width="4800" height="2700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a1bc5410-31d2-11ec-979f-31125d4581ff" width="4800" height="2700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spry Fox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Epic Games Publishing announcement of Spry Fox and Eyes Out, featuring Spry Fox's concept art.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Epic Games Publishing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commerce Department limits sale of hacking tools to Russia and China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department has <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private"><ins>announced new rules</ins></a> related to the export and resale of cyber intrusion software. Once the limits come into effect in 90 days, companies that want to sell their hacking tools to countries “of national security or weapons of mass destruction concern” will need to obtain a license from the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). The policy also covers nations that are under a US arms embargo.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/commerce-department-announces-new-rule-aimed-at-stemming-sale-of-hacking-tools-to-repressive-governments/2021/10/20/ecb56428-311b-11ec-93e2-dba2c2c11851_story.html"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>, </em>the rule is complicated. There are already many limitations on the export of intrusion software. Similarly, there are opportunities for companies to obtain exceptions. The main point is that the policy would cover the sale of software to countries like China and Russia. It would also limit the sale of programs like NSO’s  Pegasus spyware, which some governments have used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>target dissidents and journalists</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The United States Government opposes the misuse of technology to abuse human rights or conduct other malicious cyber activities, and these new rules will help ensure that US companies are not fueling authoritarian practices,” the Commerce Department said.</p><p>Among the 42 countries involved in the <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/wassenaar"><ins>Wassenaar Arrangement</ins></a>, a pact that sets voluntary export controls on military and dual-use technologies, the US is one of the last to impose limits on the sale of hacking software. Part of the reason for that is that the country has spent years working on the rules to ensure they don’t prevent cybersecurity researchers across the globe from working together to discover new flaws.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/commerce-department-hacking-tool-license-requirement-170912962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d8318755-8d32-4ae5-9845-8e1f644b24f0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 17:09:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634749755</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T17:09:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3f56a2c0-2152-11ec-b5db-de53e7a1cb44" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3f56a2c0-2152-11ec-b5db-de53e7a1cb44" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thana Prasongsin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ripping right past the password]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ripping right past the password]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>DJI has revealed the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Ronin 4D" href="https://bit.ly/3jkuL2c">Ronin 4D</a>, a cinema camera system with a built-in 4-axis gimbal, 8K resolution and LiDAR rangefinder that promises &quot;sharper, faster and more reliable focusing.&quot; With a price starting at $7,199, it&#39;s aimed at professionals, but shows DJI&#39;s technological prowess both with gimbals and camera technology.&nbsp;</p><p>The &quot;Zenmuse X9&quot; camera is designed exclusively for the Ronin 4D and should give dedicated camera manufacturers pause. It&#39;s a full-frame interchangeable model that can use either DJI&#39;s DL or Leica M lenses (along with other mirrorless lenses via adapters) and comes with no less than nine built-in neutral-density (ND) filters for controlling exposure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f2d1d940-31c5-11ec-859f-308a2e72d806" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="81654643-dde0-39e3-a68e-c5da7dc5f72e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>It&#39;s available either in a 6K model that can handle 6K at 60fps and 4K at 120fps, or an 8K 75 fps version. It can capture files in RAW, ProRes or H.264, allowing maximum flexibility in production. DJI claims 14 stops of dynamic range, and it should be good in low-light thanks to the dual-native 800/5000 ISO.&nbsp;</p><p>The gimbal itself is one of the first to offer Z-axis stabilization, DJI said. The aim is to reduce vertical jarring when a camera operator walks or runs, a trick that usually requires considerable skill. Helping in that regard is the Ronin 4D&#39;s relatively small size and 4.67 kg (10.3 pounds) heft, excluding the lens and storage card. It uses data from downward time of flight (ToF) sensors, forward and downward dual-visual sensors, a built-in IMU and a barometer. It also comes with DJI&#39;s ActiveTrack Pro (similar to that found on its consumer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-osmo-mobile-5-gimbal-selfie-stick-135559718.html">gimbals</a> and drones), which uses AI to power framing and tracking.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0321dfc0-31c6-11ec-bcef-11aec4474753" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="e5b60c0a-f67b-35ad-8ed1-bcab8a22b332"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">tomgo.tang/DJI</div></figure><p>As for the LiDAR focusing system, it offers &quot;43,200 ranging points reaching as far as 10 meters, locating subjects quickly and accurately, even in low-light environments,&quot; DJI said in a press release. It didn&#39;t mention any other autofocus technology used by the camera, though it &quot;supports human face/body recognition and framing of any subject.&quot; It also noted that the system &quot;measures the distance to the subject without relying on surface textures or hunting for edges,&quot; implying it doesn&#39;t employ contrast-detect AF.&nbsp;</p><p>The system supports full autofocus, manual focus and &quot;Automated Manual Focus&quot; (AMF) that allows camera operators to &quot;pull focus with extreme precision.&quot; The general idea with AMF is that the autofocus handles most AF chores, but allows the operate to intervene manually at any point.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/181b2300-31c6-11ec-baef-011c114d466f" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="93fc25c1-0bfc-388f-a783-7eba1495dd04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>Other features including a long range (20,000 feet) video transmitter that outputs a 1080/60p feed to remote monitors, three storage methods (USB SSD, CFexpress Type-B and DJI&#39;s proprietary PROSSD 1TB), built-in microphones along with 3.5mm mic ports and XLR ports via an expansion plate, and a battery with up to 2.5 hours of shooting time.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Ronin 4D" href="https://bit.ly/3jkuL2c">Ronin 4D</a> with a 6K camera costs $7,199, while the 8K model is $11,499. Both come with the gimbal, camera, LiDAR range finder, a monitor, hand grips, top handle, a carrying case and a battery. That&#39;s a lot, of course, but less than some cinema camera systems by themselves — and DJI&#39;s Ronin 2 cinema stabilizer runs $8,000-plus without any camera at all.&nbsp;</p><div id="1008a71d59f445bcb0bd2160262ae7cc"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiVJnRXUwKw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415191e2-4cfa-437c-b9a2-792812b7aef3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:57:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634749984</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T17:13:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[USA News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DJI]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows 11 beta users can start testing Android apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You finally have a chance to try Android apps in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> — provided you&#39;re willing to live on the bleeding edge for a while.

The company says it’s an improvement on its Elite offering and it delivers “rich and powerful vocals” with “superior clarity and noise dampening.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the V2 X is a new version of the Seiren X, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-20-razer-webcam-microphone-made-for-streamers.html">which emerged in 2017</a>. It&#39;s a 25mm condenser mic with a supercaridoid pickup pattern, which Razer suggests bolsters the device’s voice isolation capabilities. The company is promising “crisp and natural vocals” with the V2 X as well.</p><p>Razer recently introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-budget-webcam-capture-card-streaming-newbies-kiyo-x-ripsaw-x-162956687.html">a webcam and capture card</a> for streaming newbies and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kaira-x-headset-xbox-playstation-164416154.html">entry-level headset</a> for console gamers.

The original M1 processor paired four high-performance and four low-power cores with a 7- or 8-core GPU, and with that set up it delivered impressive results. The M1-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro bested a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an 8-core Intel i9 CPU and dedicated GPU <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLVcRkFtEcA">when we tested it last year</a>, and did so while staying impressively cool and quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The new M1 Pro and M1 Max bump the core count to eight high-performance and two low-power cores, and add 16, 24, or 32 GPU cores.

The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks also come with a 120Hz display with HDR, and improved speakers.

The amount of stuff that mom’s need to keep track of is, in a word, immense. Since I brought my twins home from the hospital, I’ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-newborn-log/id779656557">an app</a> to note every bottle, diaper change, nap, medication, bath time and more. That’s worked well so far, but now that my kids are older, I’ve had a harder time immediately logging their events. That’s partially because our routines were interrupted with a recent move and partially because they <em>really </em>want to play with my phone every time they see it. Regardless, I’m trying to get us all back into an established pattern of meals and nap times so I’ve been wanting to re-establish my habit of logging all their details.</p><p>Talli sells a $99 physical gadget for this purpose: a single-touch tracking device that lets busy, sleep-deprived parents push a button to log activities like bottle feeds and bedtimes. The <a href="https://fave.co/3iXtgGW">Talli Baby one-touch tracker</a> includes seven pre-assigned buttons and a miscellaneous eighth, and it pairs with an app to provide you the best of both worlds. A single-function device to track kids’ care may not sound like a big deal, but if you’ve ever tried to operate a touchscreen with diaper cream all over your hands, you may be able to see the utility here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/72e24170-30e4-11ec-bfdf-b49595c6e30b" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="83b7e639-7cb8-3382-b129-b295cdaaa487"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Talli is a white and faux-woodgrain box with rounded edges, roughly the size of a small but stuffed wallet. It has two rows of four activity buttons with icons to indicate which action the button is assigned to: bottle feeding, solid food, wet diaper, dirty diaper, sleeping, nursing, pumping or “miscellaneous,” which can be customized within the app. Events that happen at the same time — say, a wet and dirty diaper — require simultaneous button presses. There’s also a small WiFi button on the lower right that’s used during setup, and the company says that WiFi is only used when the device is transmitting an event. The rear contains slots to wall-mount the Talli using the included hardware.</p><p>Setting up the Talli is fairly uncomplicated and follows the same steps as many other app-connected devices: download the app, create an account, add a device, connect to a WiFi network and you’re done. When I first set up the device, it kept flashing an error message, which the included start-up pamphlet instructed me was a WiFi connection issue likely due to an incorrect network name or password.</p><p>Only I hadn’t gotten to that step yet, I was only trying to sync the device. I contacted Talli support and tried again and was able to connect and set up the device without any further issue. It’s worked normally since then so I’m not certain what the issue was, but it did make me realize that adding a hardware device to my tracking process meant there would be another potential point of failure. Since Talli pairs with an app that can be used independently to track what you’re doing with your kids, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the hardware wasn’t working. However, it would detract from the main advantage of the system: the convenience of pressing a button on the tracker and continuing with your day.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b021e1d0-30e4-11ec-be57-12f1f9232edd" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="bf0d407d-da47-3d0c-9aba-2cfee0d3782d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>Taking out my smartphone, opening an app and typing in an entry isn’t exactly heavy lifting, but doing that while two toddlers wind themselves between my legs, grab at my phone, whine, harass the cat, throw everything out of the kitchen drawers and try to climb over child gates is another story. Being able to press a button and be done was an unexpected relief: My kid’s data was logged, so I knew when they were last changed and I could always flesh out the entries with more detail in the app later (though I’ll admit that rarely happened). It was extremely easy to use the Talli instead of my previous app, and it was oddly satisfying, too — not unlike crossing something off a to-do list.</p><p>Because Talli runs on four AA batteries, it has a portable design allowing it to be moved anywhere or handed off to any caretakers or babysitters. It can also be mounted on a wall, which has advantages and disadvantages depending on how you’ll use it. I kept my Talli untethered because my changing table area doesn’t have the best WiFi coverage, so I kept it on a nearby shelf where I could touch the buttons on my way in and out of the room.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a0dd510-310c-11ec-997f-532cdf7aaeb7" alt="Talli Baby" data-uuid="f34f71b1-0e49-31c5-b4f5-42bdc28e5a0e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Talli</div></figure><p>Frankly, I would have preferred to mount the thing; when grabbing for the device, I would often accidentally hit a button and register an incorrect event, which I would then have to remember to delete later. But I also often had to move the Talli out of sight, because my son is particularly enamored with pushing buttons and things that light up, so the Talli was like forbidden candy to him. It was hard to find the perfect location where the device was connected to my WiFi network, easily accessible to me and didn’t draw his attention.</p><p>Each Talli device gets assigned to one child, that is to say you’ll need one Talli per child. But you can assign multiple devices to the same child if you end up getting more than one for different areas of your home. And Talli works with Alexa, so you can have the assistant log events for you if you say “Alexa tell Talli Baby that Sam had a dirty diaper.” You can also request that Alexa read you the most recent activity reports. I don’t currently have an Alexa-enabled device, so I wasn’t able to test this out yet. The company says Google Home compatibility is coming soon, too.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Much like the device itself, the Talli app is  simply designed and straightforward to use. The home screen contains the same icons as the device; when a button is active — it turns green for a pumping session or a nap time, for example. Near each button is a date and time stamp for the last logged event and tapping on the icon brings up an entry page to edit and add details. I sometimes had to tap commands a few times — say, to pause or start a sleep timer — but this otherwise worked fine.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c220070-30e9-11ec-bfe9-e479f059f977" alt="Talli Baby app" data-uuid="5998f4f5-111e-3e61-9ffe-b356f4f46f35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the app is organized into a Daily List, which is exactly what it sounds like: a list of your child’s daily events. There’s also a Details view which provides an hour-by-hour graph of events and can be toggled to show any of your child’s metrics over a time period. My favorites were the Averages view, which shows totals for each event, and the More tab, which has selections for account sharing, reminders and children’s profiles. I’m trying to switch the twins over to all solid foods and being able to track what they’ve eaten, how much and when has helped me establish routines and menus. And because it was easy to press a button on the way in or out of the room, Talli made it possible for me to log how often my son woke in the middle of the night and how long before he went back to sleep.</p><p>However, the app frequently (albeit briefly) flashed a “Refreshing your data” screen when I navigated around the options. I had to wait an extra beat or two for the data to refresh when I did almost anything in the app: changed screens, edited data, deleted an event and the like. I’m hoping this is due to my satellite internet connection, because it was one of my biggest pain points with the Talli system. I will say I appreciated that there was no subscription component: Talli offers all its information and your data without any additional fees, whether you purchase the tracker or simply use the free app.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The Talli device offers something that isn’t otherwise available: a hardware device dedicated to tracking everything you do with your child on a daily basis. It’s nicely designed, easy to use and has an app that charts and graphs the data for you. I liked using it a lot more than I expected to, given that tracking all my kids’ various activities through an app had become a bit of a chore. But using the Talli tracker wasn’t a chore — and having a physical device (even more, a single button) that I could tap and walk away from did indeed help me stay more consistent with tracking habits.</p><p>I only wish that I had found a better location for the device in my kids’ room — and I wish that the app didn’t lag so much — but otherwise I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Talli Tracker fit into my lifestyle. I can see it being particularly useful for those who have family or multiple caretakers tending to children or for people who prefer physical logging methods like calendars or notebooks. But it’s also a $99 gadget — and when a free app just requires more work but will ultimately do the job, it makes the Talli a bit of a luxury.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-talli-baby-tracker-is-a-one-touch-system-for-logging-kids-activities-130022927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f9663317-90f0-4e03-8700-9f538035edce</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634735278</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T13:08:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/99b2b240-31a6-11ec-b9fe-84293a39baae" width="4032" height="2634" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/99b2b240-31a6-11ec-b9fe-84293a39baae" width="4032" height="2634" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Talli]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An overhead view of the Talli Baby tracker and a cup of coffee on a small round table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Talli Baby tracker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['LEGO Star Wars: Castaways' arrives November 19th on Apple Arcade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-trailer-release-window-192234269.html"><em>LEGO Star Wars</em></a> game is heading to Apple Arcade, and it&#39;s the first social, action-adventure title in the franchise.

The video game company has <a href="https://activisionblizzard.com/content/atvi/activisionblizzard/ab-touchui/ab/web/en/newsroom/2021/10/creating-a-more-accountable-workplace.html">published</a> the letter Executive VP for Corporate Affairs Fran Townsend sent to employees revealing the move, in which she also said that more than 20 other individuals faced different types of disciplinary action. Back in July, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against the developer for allowing a work environment wherein female employees were allegedly subjected to constant sexual harassment.</p><p>The agency, which sued the company after a two-year investigation, detailed several of its findings in the lawsuit. It said female employees constantly have to fend off unwanted sexual comments, and that they have to endure being groped by male colleagues. They&#39;re also not paid as much as their male counterparts,  are typically promoted more slowly and fired more quickly. At the time, Townsend told employees that the lawsuit &quot;presented a distorted&quot; picture of the company and that it included &quot;factually incorrect, old and out of context stories.&quot; Hundreds of employees walked out in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html">protest</a> over the company&#39;s response.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, in her letter, Townsend said that there&#39;s a team dedicated to investigating harassment claims, &quot;working tirelessly to ensure that, moving forward, [the company] is a place where people are not only heard, but empowered.&quot; The team received an increasing number of reports in recent months, including concerns from years ago, and it was the members&#39; investigation that led to the exit of more than 20 employees. Townsend declined to name those individuals, but she told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cb805b9-4d14-40ee-a1f2-72bc3c3e1ea6"><em>Financial Times</em></a> that they include several game developers and a few supervisors. None of them came from senior management or from the board.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113"><em>Kotaku</em></a> report from August <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html">named</a> three senior designers who abruptly exited the company. Two of them — <em>Diablo 4</em> lead designer Jesse McCree and <em>World of Warcraft</em> designer Jonathan LeCraft — were previously pictured inside the Cosby Suite. In its lawsuit, DEFH said the Cosby Suite is a room with a photo of Bill Cosby where male employees allegedly harassed women during company events.</p><p>To be able to handle more complaints, Activision Blizzard hired three full-time employees to join the investigation team. It&#39;s also adding 19 more full-time roles to its overall Ethics &amp; Compliance Team, two of which will be dedicated to overseeing investigations for the EMEA and APAC regions. Townsend admitted that the team can&#39;t always share the details of an investigation, but she also promised more transparency &quot;We know there’s a desire to know about the outcome when misconduct is reported. Sometimes, there are privacy reasons we can’t share. But where we can, we will be sharing more information with you. We will also be providing you regular aggregate data about investigative outcomes,&quot; she wrote in her letter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-fired-20-employees-harassment-cases-112540361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">786bf980-e5bb-41d0-871c-cfb464a03e11</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 11:35:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634728107</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T11:08:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in , in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro first impressions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google’s Pixel 6 family is officially priced and will launch on October 28th, available to pre-order today.

Again. But will Google finally be able to get its phones in people’s hands? The company glimpsed success with its very competitively priced Pixel 3a, briefly edging out OnePlus in phone sales for a hot second. Then the Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 failed to repeat the success at tougher prices. Notably, the $600 Pixel 6 is $100 cheaper than last year&#39;s Pixel 5, but it looks to be a far better phone.</p><p>Each phone has a thick camera bar stretching across the back. The Pixel 6 has a dual-camera system, with wide and ultrawide lenses, while the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto option. On both devices, the primary camera is a 50-megapixel sensor with a quad-bayer filter, which puts four pixels behind each standard color block — you’re not going to get 50-megapixel photos here, but something more in the realm of 12.5 megapixels. The Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is a 48-megapixel sensor with 4x optical zoom. There are no invisible front-facing cameras — or notches — but a pin-hole camera on both Pixels. There is also an under-screen thumbprint sensor for the first time in a Pixel phone.

But there are a lot of new things to tackle with the Pixel 6 series. This series has the company’s first “pro” phone, some Android 12-exclusive tricks and significant voice recognition enhancements — if you’re in the US.</p><p>The two phones differ slightly in design, which marks a departure from previous years. Instead of the matte soft-touch texture of older Pixels, both Pixel 6 phones have glass-covered sides,   creating a premium feel. According to Cherlynn Low, they’re a little blockier and feel more like a Samsung device — which may not be a bad thing.</p><p>Both phones are also much larger than the Pixel 5, and though their screen sizes differ, they have almost the same footprint. But the main feature improvement in the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is their cameras, and this is what Cherlynn (and I) are most excited about. For now, she could only gather some impressions while under the supervision of Google reps, but expect her own review to put all the cameras through their paces.

Expect a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video with 10-bit All-I XAVC recording. And that’s probably just the start.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-is-announcing-a-new-camera-on-october-21st-likely-the-a-7-iv-085021205.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html">Facebook Portal Go review</a></h2><h3>Tablet or smart display?</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb84bfc0-3190-11ec-afff-19bde7218d71" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="fb200d41-15ed-3bc6-8003-2455ff802bfa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Facebook’s new Portal Go adds portability to the company’s video-chat-focused smart display.

The Go has other improvements, too, such as a more personalized home screen and a new Household Mode that makes it more family-friendly. However, it lacks a lot of features that other smart displays have, and Facebook’s poor reputation precedes it.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-vs-snapchat-spectacles-173247974.html"><br></a></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-event-2021-highlights-192245034.html">Here&#39;s everything Google announced at its Pixel 6 event</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-vs-the-apple-iphone-12-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-oneplus-9-pro-172019652.html">The Pixel 6 Pro vs. the competition: Telephoto, Tensor and more</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-vs-the-competition-iphone-12-galaxy-s21-171553646.html">The Pixel 6 vs. the competition: The Tensor chip goes up to bat</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-smartphones-173051481.html">How to pre-order the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-162306317.html">Dbrand says its latest PS5 faceplates will survive Sony&#39;s legal wrath</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-robots-123039227.html">Raspberry Pi&#39;s Build HAT helps students build LEGO robots</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-campaign-website-defaced-072039009.html">Donald Trump&#39;s campaign website was defaced by a hacker</a></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-first-impressions-111515992.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5802919e-45a9-403e-ad4a-5b65f1994427</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 11:15:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634737828</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T13:50:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2055830-30f3-11ec-8ff7-c6914738a341" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2055830-30f3-11ec-8ff7-c6914738a341" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook fined $69.6 million in the UK for breaking rules related to its Giphy takeover]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After Facebook acquired the popular GIF repository Giphy (reportedly for $400 million), the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">investigation</a> to determine if the merger would lessen competition. As part of that probe, it said Facebook couldn&#39;t continue with activities related to the merger (integrating products, merging teams and so on) without prior approval from the CMA.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the CMA has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach">announced</a> that it has fined Facebook £50.5 million ($70 million) for breaching those enforcement orders. &quot;This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an [order] by consciously refusing to report all the required information,&quot; the CMA said in a press release.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The authority said that Facebook &quot;significantly limited the scope of&quot; updates required by the CMA, despite repeated warnings. Citing criticism by the Competition Appeal Tribunal and Court of Appeal, it noted that Facebook engaged in &quot;what might be regarded as a high-risk strategy&quot; around a &quot;lack of cooperation&quot; with the CMA.</p><p>In response to the fine, a Facebook spokesperson gave the following statement: &quot;We strongly disagree with the CMA’s unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA’s decision and consider our options.&quot;</p><p>The CMA said it also fined the company £500,000 ($700,000) for changing its Chief Compliance Officers twice without seeking consent. Facebook saw net revenue of $29.4 billion in 2020, so the fines are relative pocket change. However, its issues with the CMA aren&#39;t over yet, as the authority has yet to make a decision on the merger itself. In the meantime, it promised to &quot;work constructively with the companies as things progress further.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 10/20/2021 7:58 AM ET</strong>: Facebook gave Engadget a statement on the ruling, which has been added to the article.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-fines-facebook-70-million-for-breaking-rules-related-to-its-giphy-purchase-110227187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0dd26a38-8894-43e0-bf4e-d2dc6861206a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 11:02:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634731148</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T11:59:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30fca520-3193-11ec-bd9f-c96f357afb8b" width="5524" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30fca520-3193-11ec-bd9f-c96f357afb8b" width="5524" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toby Melville / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A giant logo is seen at Facebook's headquarters in London, Britain, December 4, 2017.

The deal represents a win for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) workers, who have typically been <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/iatse-hard-line-film-tv-contract-talks-amptp-1234800346/">paid less</a> for streaming shows than theatrical film productions and broadcast TV series in the US.</p><p>In an informational brief, IATSE tweeted that wages will increase for long-form, episodic and mini-series at up to 30 percent, depending on the classification. Those boosts depend on the size of the streaming company, with rates higher for services with 20 million or more subscribers. Longform productions between $20 and $32 million used to get discounts if they were headed to streaming services, but that will no longer be the case.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="42b43d8fd4f44a069cac9b788fe5b5ea"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: We are releasing our first three one page documents explaining how the new tentative Basic Agreement addresses the priorities members identified early in the bargaining process.<br><br>This is a non-exhaustive set of member priorities, more soon.<br><br>1.

He said that while the company is &quot;deeply committed to inclusion,&quot; it&#39;s equally committed to &quot;supporting artistic freedom with the creators who work at Netflix.&quot; He added that Netflix would not add a disclaimer in front of the special as employees requested, reasoning that Chappelle himself gives a warning at the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarandos also addressed the issue of transparency in the company after an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fires-employee-trans-leader-dave-chapelle-leak-204706894.html">employee was fired</a> for leaking internal company documents showing viewer figures for Netflix shows, including Chappelle&#39;s previous special. &quot;We’re deeply committed to the culture of transparency,&quot; he told <em>THR</em>. &quot;And it also depends upon a great deal of trust with our employees that we continue to secure, but we don’t plan on changing any of our internal operations around that.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-internal-communication-over-dave-chappelle-special-080412118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38d5c08d-dcec-4a4f-9808-cb98e96bc373</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 08:04:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634717054</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T08:04:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13476990-3173-11ec-af4f-56e641bd9a60" width="4000" height="2665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13476990-3173-11ec-af4f-56e641bd9a60" width="4000" height="2665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ROBYN BECK via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Netflix logo is seen on the Netflix, Inc. building on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California on October 19, 2021. - Netflix reported billion-dollar profits and booming subscriber growth on October 19 that beat forecasts as global hits like Squid Game drew viewers in droves.

That makes it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history, the publication said.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the &quot;cultural zeitgeist&quot; and claimed the number 1 spot in the streaming giant&#39;s rankings in 94 countries, including the US, Netflix has revealed. Since there&#39;s a huge demand for all things <em>Squid Game</em>, Netflix has also announced that consumer products based on the show are now on their way to retail.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A few days ago, <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html">obtained</a> documents detailing the company&#39;s scores for &quot;impact value&quot; and &quot;efficiency.&quot; Netflix has been pretty secretive on the metrics that make a title successful or not, and the documents showed how it measures series&#39; and movies&#39; success. <em>Squid Game</em> was a standout, generating $891.1 million in impact value, which is around 41.7 times — that&#39;s its efficiency score — its budget of $21.4 million.</p><p>Thanks in part to <em>Squid Game&#39;s</em> massive viewership, Netflix said it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-19/netflix-tops-third-quarter-subscriber-views-sees-upbeat-fourth?sref=10lNAhZ9">posted</a> its best subscriber growth of the year. &quot;As the quarter continued, we saw an acceleration in our growth,&quot; Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said on the call.

Apparently, the social media giant will have a new name that will reflect its focus on creating a metaverse. It&#39;s also possibly connected to its unreleased social virtual reality world called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-oculus-social-vr-world-facebook-horizon.html">Horizon Worlds</a>. The social network itself will likely retain the Facebook branding and will be under a new parent company, along with Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. That would be similar to what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-02-google-alphabet-restructuring.html">Google did in 2015</a> when it put its various projects and divisions, along with itself, under its parent company Alphabet.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> says the name change is a closely guarded secret at the moment and not even all senior leaders have knowledge about it. Mark Zuckerberg has long talked about wanting to make Facebook a metaverse company and has been taking steps towards that goal. Earlier this year, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html">formed</a> a team dedicated to building a metaverse, and just a few days ago, it talked about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-europe-jobs-metaverse-220103694.html">adding</a> 10,000 &quot;high-skilled&quot; jobs across the European Union over the next five years to build its virtual and augmented reality experiences. It also released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a> augmented reality smart glasses in September.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We reached out to Facebook for a statement, and company spokesperson Joe Osborne said: &quot;We don’t comment on rumor or speculation.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s unclear how long Facebook been has planning on changing its name, but it&#39;s almost certainly hoping it&#39;ll serve as a distraction from the investigations it&#39;s facing and the recent flood of bad press. Former executive-turned-whisleblower Frances Haugen provided the Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission with a treasure trove of internal documents, dropped several revelations about the company and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">accused</a> it of choosing &quot;profit over safety&quot; — something Zuckerberg adamantly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-denies-facebook-profit-over-safety-033717690.html">denied</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In early October, she <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">testified</a> at a Senate hearing about research she says proves that the social network repeatedly lied about its platform, including the &quot;efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems, and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages.&quot; Haugen has several ideas on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">what Facebook should change</a>, but none of them has anything to do with changing its name. They include going back to chronological feeds from algorithmic ranking, adding some features that would prevent the spread of misinformation and opening Facebook research to people outside the company.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">25673060-7e38-46cf-b319-0593ca45c581</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 04:29:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634737720</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T13:48:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/4d5a7330-a5d2-11ea-a75e-1683395fdf3b" width="3132" height="2310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/4d5a7330-a5d2-11ea-a75e-1683395fdf3b" width="3132" height="2310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MUNICH, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 15: Founder and CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg makes a speech as he attends the 56th Munich Security Conference at Bayerischer Hof Hotel in Munich, Germany on February 15, 2020.
