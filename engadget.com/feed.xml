It previously confirmed the existence of Project Bernanke, but maintained there was no wrongdoing and that the states&#39; lawsuit &quot;misrepresents&quot; its ad business.

At the least, the amendment underscores the states&#39; attitude toward Google — they&#39;re determined to curb its behavior.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-texas-antitrust-lawsuit-project-bernanke-165300880.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a09302ea-dc07-4814-851d-8d9fd5cf6375</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 16:53:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636908782</ingested><modified>2021-11-14T16:53:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fe321030-4565-11ec-aff3-3f42110b0cd1" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fe321030-4565-11ec-aff3-3f42110b0cd1" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA - OCTOBER 28: Google headquarters is seen in Mountain View, California, United States on October 28, 2021.

The company is selling its latest streaming adapter at a new low price <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max" href="https://amzn.to/3qFEPqX">of $35</a>, a full $20 below its original sticker. That makes it a much easier choice if you were otherwise contemplating the regular Stick 4K — even with frequent sales, you&#39;re only paying a little bit more for a lot of futureproofing. The Fire TV Cube has also reached an all-time low <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Cube" href="https://amzn.to/3qBxZCN">of $80</a> (normally $120) if you&#39;d prefer a hybrid smart speaker and media hub.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qFEPqX" id="df26c08734d24f71beac5000edc680c9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max">Buy Fire TV Stick 4K Max on Amazon - $35</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qBxZCN" id="e8c6fcc1248848f3a81d9a7441363fd7" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Cube">Buy Fire TV Cube on Amazon - $80</a><p>The regular Fire TV Stick 4K is also on sale <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3HhrsmV">for $25</a> (typically $50) if price is more important, or if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need the extras its Max counterpart offers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Max may look much like its regular counterpart on the outside, but it&#39;s about 40 percent faster. That promises faster load times, a smoother interface, better gaming and headroom for new features like a live picture-in-picture view of your video doorbell. WiFi 6 support also delivers a more reliable connection for your 4K streams if you have a similarly modern router. While those aren&#39;t must-haves, the price gap is small enough ($10 as of this writing) to make them worth the money.</p><p>Fire TV&#39;s usual caveats apply regardless of the model you&#39;re buying.  You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of apps and services, but there&#39;s no doubt Amazon favors its own. Likewise, these Alexa-centric devices won&#39;t be great fits if your smart home revolves around Apple HomeKit or Google Assistant. For most anyone else, though, these will be solid choices for living room streaming.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-sale-152737451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7ab45a85-0972-4512-9715-dbbf4581b4ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 14 Nov 2021 15:27:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636903660</ingested><modified>2021-11-14T15:27:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af68ead0-4558-11ec-9bf5-22bfe67234c7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af68ead0-4558-11ec-9bf5-22bfe67234c7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FBI email servers were hacked to target a security researcher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The FBI appears to have been used as a pawn in a fight between hackers and security researchers. <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-system-hacked-to-email-urgent-warning-about-fake-cyberattacks/">According</a> to <em>Bleeping Computer</em>, the FBI has confirmed intruders compromised its email servers early today (November 13th) to send fake messages claiming recipients had fallen prone to data breaches. The emails tried to pin the non-existent attacks on Vinny Troia, the leader of dark web security firms NightLion and Shadowbyte.</p><p>The non-profit intelligence organization Spamhaus quickly <a href="https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459451401269043201">shed light</a> on the bogus messages. The attackers used legitimate FBI systems to conduct the attack, using email addresses scraped from a database for the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN), among other sources.  Over 100,000 addresses received the fake emails in at least two waves.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FBI described the hack as an &quot;ongoing situation&quot; and didn&#39;t initially have more details to share. It asked email recipients to report messages like these to the bureau&#39;s <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/">Internet Crime Complaint Center</a> or the <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a>. Troia told <em>Bleeping Computer</em> he believed the perpetrators might be linked to &quot;Pompomourin,&quot; a persona that has attacked the researcher in the past.</p><p>Feuds between hackers and the security community aren&#39;t new. In March, attackers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-email-server-exploited-30000-us-organizations-043324374.html">exploiting Microsoft Exchange servers</a> tried to implicate security journalist Brian Krebs using a rogue domain. However, it&#39;s rare that they use real domains from a government agency like the FBI as part of their campaign. While that may be more effective than usual (the FBI was swamped with calls from anxious IT administrators), it might also prompt a particularly swift response — law enforcement won&#39;t take kindly to being a victim.</p><div id="9ce86245383e4ba49efd65bca327141d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">These fake warning emails are apparently being sent to addresses scraped from ARIN database.

There are some areas where the new arrangement (billed by the UN as the Glasgow Climate Pact) may offer significant progress, but there are also concerns it doesn&#39;t hold countries to stricter standards — including a move away from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-30-clean-coal-myth-trump-carbon-capture-energy-no.html">coal energy</a>.</p><p>In negotiations that extended roughly a day past the original November 12th deadline, representatives from China and India successfully changed language in the COP26 agreement that asked countries to &quot;phase-down&quot; unabated coal use rather than &quot;phase-out.&quot; While COP26 president Alok Sharma and numerous countries&#39; delegates wanted the tougher language, Sharma said it was &quot;vital&quot; to protect the deal. However, there are worries this will give coal-dependent countries like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">China</a> and India an excuse to avoid firmer commitments to emissions reduction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previous critics blasted wealthier nations for failing to act on a promise of giving poorer countries $100 billion per year until 2023 to help them deal with climate change. The Glasgow deal only committed to making a new plan in the next three years.</p><p>The final pact does include some notable measures. It asks countries &quot;revisit and strengthen&quot; their climate change plans before the end of 2022, as <em>New Scientist</em><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2297452-cop26-world-agrees-to-phase-out-fossil-fuel-subsidies-and-reduce-coal/">noted</a>. Similarly, there&#39;s a strategy to address long-running disputes over global carbon credit markets. Numerous countries promised to reduce methane emissions and stop deforestation, and the agreement called for reduced subsidies on fossil fuels. Separately, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-china-climate-change-pledge-cop-26-194435337.html">US and China reached a deal</a> to limit climate change in the 2020s, including a new recognition from China that methane had a significant impact on rising temperatures.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are fears the COP26 arrangement is generally too soft. It doesn&#39;t set many binding targets. The final language only &quot;requests&quot; that countries rethink their plans, for instance. The pact might prompt some countries to step up their environmental initiatives, but others may face relatively few consequences if they fall short.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-glasgow-pact-212507731.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c9886c6-7440-45ec-80e6-e3572b3d452d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:25:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636838709</ingested><modified>2021-11-13T21:25:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2c98d340-44c2-11ec-b9b3-63de6df0f242" width="3162" height="2077" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yves Herman / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[COP26 President Alok Sharma holds a gavel as he speaks at the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain November 13, 2021.

But one technology Roddenberry called for in the 1960s has yet to make it off the screen: teleportation. It&#39;s not only that &quot;we just don&#39;t have enough power,&quot; as Scotty would say, we also lack the fundamental knowledge base to make it a reality. For now, at least. In their latest book, <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/frequently-asked-questions-about-the-universe/9780593189313"><em>Frequently Asked Questions about the Universe</em></a>, Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson delve into this and a host of other quandaries facing humanity — from whether there&#39;s an afterlife, why aliens haven&#39;t made contact with us yet, or if our observable existence is actually a computer simulation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec48b220-3e6c-11ec-b3df-607b033f0ef1" alt="frequently asked questions about the universe" data-uuid="4aa49078-dd17-32ba-bb40-cea6e0545ca9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Penguin</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from</em> Frequently Asked Questions about the Universe <em>by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson.

No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>If your dream of teleportation is to be here in one moment, and then be in a totally different place the next moment, then we are sad to tell you right off the bat that this is impossible. Unfortunately, physics has some pretty hard rules about anything happening instantaneously. Anything that happens (an effect) has to have a cause, which in turn requires the transmission of information. Think about it: in order for two things to be causally related to each other (like you disappearing here and you appearing somewhere else), they have to somehow talk to each other. And in this universe, everything, including information, has a speed limit.</p><p>Information has to travel through space just like everything else, and the fastest anything can travel in this universe is the speed of light. Really, the speed of light should have been called the “speed of information” or “the universe’s speed limit.” It’s baked into relativity and the very idea of cause and effect, which are at the heart of physics.</p><p>Even gravity can’t move faster than light. The Earth doesn’t feel gravity from where the Sun is right now; it feels gravity from where the Sun was eight minutes ago. That’s how long it takes information to travel the ninety-three million miles between here and there. If the Sun disappeared (teleporting off for its own vacation), the Earth would continue in its normal orbit for eight minutes before realizing that the Sun was gone.</p><p>So the idea that you can disappear in one place and reappear in another place instantly is pretty much out of the question. Something has to happen in between, and that something can’t move faster than light.</p><p>Fortunately, most of us aren’t such sticklers when it comes to the definition of “teleportation.” Most of us will take “almost instantly” or “in the blink of an eye” or even “as fast as the laws of physics will allow” for our teleportation needs. If that’s the case, then there are two options for making a teleportation machine work:</p><p>1. Your teleportation machine could transmit you to your destination at the speed of light.</p><p>2. Your teleportation machine could somehow shorten the distance between where you are and where you want to go.</p><p>Option #2 is what you might call the “portal” type of teleportation. In movies, it would be the kind of teleportation that opens up a doorway, usually through a wormhole or some kind of extradimensional subspace, that you step through to find yourself somewhere else. Wormholes are theoretical tunnels that connect points in space that are far away, and physicists have definitely proposed the existence of multiple dimensions beyond the three we are familiar with.</p><p>Sadly, both of these concepts are still very much theoretical. We haven’t actually seen a wormhole, nor do we have any idea how to open one or control where it leads. And extra dimensions aren’t really something you can move into. They only represent extra ways in which your particles might be able to wiggle.</p><p>Much more interesting to talk about is Option #1, which, as it turns out, might actually be something we can do in the near future.</p><h2>Getting There at Light Speed</h2><p>If we can’t appear in other places instantly, or take shortcuts through space, can we at least get there as fast as possible? The top speed of the universe, three hundred million meters per second, is plenty fast to cut your commute down to a fraction of a second and make trips to the stars take years instead of decades or millennia. Speed-of-light teleportation would still be awesome.</p><p>To do that, you might imagine a machine that somehow takes your body and then pushes it at the speed of light to your destination. Unfortunately, there’s a big problem with this idea, and it’s that you’re too heavy. The truth is that you’re too massive to ever travel at the speed of light. First, it would take an enormous amount of time and energy just to accelerate all the particles in your body (whether assembled or broken up somehow) to speeds that are close to the speed of light. And second, you would never get to the speed of light. It doesn’t matter how much you’ve been dieting or working on your CrossFit; nothing that has any mass can ever travel at the speed of light.</p><p>Particles like electrons and quarks, the building blocks of your atoms, have mass. That means that it takes energy to get them moving, a lot of energy to get them moving fast, and infinite energy to reach the speed of light. They can travel at very high speeds, but they can never achieve light speed.</p><p>That means that you, and the molecules and particles that make up who you are right now, would never actually be able to teleport. Not instantaneously, and not at the speed of light. Transporting your body somewhere that quickly is never going to happen. It’s just not possible to move all the particles in your body fast enough.</p><p>But does that mean teleportation is impossible? Not quite!</p><p>There is one way it can still happen, and that’s if we relax what “you” means. What if we didn’t transport you, your molecules or your particles? What if we just transmitted the idea of you?</p><h2>You Are Information</h2><p>One possible way to achieve speed-of-light teleportation is to scan you and send you as a beam of photons. Photons don’t have any mass, which means they can go as fast as the universe will allow. In fact, photons can only travel at the speed of light (there’s no such thing as a slow-moving photon).*</p><p>Here’s a basic recipe for speed-of-light teleportation:</p><p>Step #1: Scan your body and record where all your molecules and particles are.</p><p>Step #2: Transmit this information to your destination via a beam of photons.</p><p>Step #3: Receive this information and rebuild your body using new particles.</p><p>Is this possible? Humans have made incredible progress in both scanning and 3D printing technologies. These days, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can scan your body down to a resolution of 0.1 millimeters, which is about the size of a brain cell. And scientists have used 3D printers to print increasingly more complicated clusters of living cells (known as “organoids”) for testing cancer drugs. We’ve even made machines (using scanning tunneling microscopes) that can grab and move individual atoms. So it’s not hard to imagine that one day we might be able to scan and then print whole bodies.</p><p>The real limitation, though, might not be technological but philosophical. After all, if someone made a copy of you, would it actually be you?</p><p>Remember, there’s nothing particularly special about the particles that make up your body right now. All particles of a given type are the same. Every electron is perfectly identical to every other electron, and the same is true for quarks. Particles don’t come out of the universe factory with personalities or any sort of distinguishing features. The only difference between any two electrons or any two quarks is where each of them is and what other particles they’re hanging out with.*</p><p>But how much would a copy of you still be you? Well, it depends on two things. The first is the resolution of the technology that scans and prints you. Can it read and print your cells? Your molecules? Your atoms, or even your individual particles?</p><p>The even bigger question is how much your “you-ness” depends on the tiny details. What level of detail does it take for the copy to still be considered you? It turns out that this is an open question, and the answer might depend on how quantum your sense of self is.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-frequently-asked-questions-about-the-universe-jorge-cham-daniel-whiteson-penguin-163100834.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4fc3d2f-70c3-4663-9cb1-2192bcab8dbc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:31:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636478955</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T17:29:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9616eb70-3e6b-11ec-bda9-a7102c9653fb" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Why we can&#39;t &#39;beam ourselves up&#39; Star Trek-style]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[White House reportedly discouraged Intel from boosting chip production in China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden&#39;s security and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-budget-proposal-domestic-chip-manufacturing-180310697.html">domestic production efforts</a> may have a pronounced effect on Intel&#39;s plans. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/white-house-spurns-intel-plan-to-boost-chip-production-in-china?sref=10lNAhZ9">sources</a> claim the White House &quot;strongly discouraged&quot; Intel from ramping up chip production in China to help address chip shortages. The improved capacity could have been available before the end of 2022, but the Biden administration was reportedly worried about security issues.</p><p>The semiconductor firm didn&#39;t completely rule out future Chinese production increases, according to the tipsters. However, Intel is believed to have &quot;no plans&quot; at present.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel didn&#39;t directly acknowledge the government objection in a statement, but welcomed &quot;other solutions&quot; to help meet chip demand. The company had looked at a &quot;number of approaches&quot; in tandem with the US, including new wafer manufacturing in the US and Europe.</p><p>An approach like this wouldn&#39;t be surprising, if accurate. Biden has continued a wary stance toward Chinese technology, going so far as to sign a law <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html">barring Huawei and ZTE</a> from receiving FCC network licenses. While the sources didn&#39;t elaborate on the security issues with Intel, company chief Pat Gelsinger previously said a heavy dependence on Asian manufacturing represented a supply chain threat. There have also been historical concerns companies were improperly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-30-amd-denies-improperly-sharing-cpu-tech-with-china.html">sharing sensitive technology</a> with China.</p><p>Even if security weren&#39;t an issue, economic development might be a factor. Biden has pushed for more manufacturing in the US to address chip shortages, and Intel&#39;s reported Chinese expansion would have contradicted that policy. It also wouldn&#39;t have helped attempts to counter China&#39;s growth as an economic superpower.</p><p>Whatever the reasoning, a change of heart like this also risks prolonging chip shortages. While Intel is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">building US plants</a> and asking for external manufacturing help, those efforts will take time and might not cover every shortfall. Intel may have to accept a near-term blow to production to honor the White House&#39;s goals, especially if it wants any factory-oriented funds from the stalled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/semiconductors-in-america-coalition-134524022.html">CHIPS Act</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5ae8f89-dbe3-4727-90f5-0d732d8ae2f5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 16:14:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636820077</ingested><modified>2021-11-13T16:14:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d318e40-4490-11ec-bfcb-93b2b319f8a3" width="5571" height="3718" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d318e40-4490-11ec-bfcb-93b2b319f8a3" width="5571" height="3718" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aly Song / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Visitors are seen at the Intel booth during the China Digital Entertainment Expo and Conference, also known as ChinaJoy, in Shanghai, China July 30, 2021.

Gucci has laser-etched it with its iconic Rhombi design. In this context, it says it’s a visual play on words with the pattern alluding to both the initials of Guccio Gucci and the shorthand for &quot;Good Game.&quot; Well played, Gucci. The included carrying case has dedicated space for both controllers and the Xbox Series X, so your gaming setup can come with you in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9U216E-dTs&amp;ab_channel=maxwesty"><ins>Darjeeling Limited-style</ins></a> on your next trip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gucci plans to sell only 100 hand-numbered units of the bundle through its flagship stores.

Series developer DICE told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22778261/battlefield-2042-voice-chat-release"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a> the feature won’t be available until sometime after launch. The studio didn’t provide a reason for the decision. Whatever the case, the absence of voice chat will likely be keenly felt by Battlefield fans, especially on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and PlayStation 5 where matches will include as many as 128 players.</p><p>For what it’s worth, you can still use Discord or the party chat feature on your console to communicate with friends, but that won’t help you when you’re trying to play with strangers. In those instances, you’ll need to rely on the ping system, which is apparently on the cumbersome side. According to <em>Polygon</em>, you have to navigate through multiple menus before you can get to the right ping. All told, it sounds like Battlefield’s already chaotic matches will be a tad more unpredictable in the first few weeks that <em>2042</em> is available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-voice-chat-200235461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9ca877db-c511-433c-805d-f8cfd612bb48</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 20:02:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636746765</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T19:52:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8e1de660-ca0a-11eb-afa5-8accd287fe9e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8e1de660-ca0a-11eb-afa5-8accd287fe9e" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DICE / EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rockstar pulls the remastered GTA trilogy on PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PC version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition</em></a> seems to have some serious issues at the minute.

We got <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/movies/obi-wan-kenobi/wPJYvt0aoozZ">our first glimpse</a> at the series during Disney+ Day, the streaming network&#39;s extended birthday celebration. While there&#39;s no actual footage from Obi-Wan available, a behind-the-scenes clip streaming through the app and concept art reveals some familiar and new territory for the franchise. Ewan McGregor confirms the show will start off with Obi-Wan trying to keep Luke Skywalker safe — as you&#39;d expect — but that&#39;s just the launching point for a whole series of new adventures, according to director Deborah Chow.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2efa8220-43df-11ec-bbf5-5782a72d68a1" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney+" data-uuid="658a9f33-9b48-3170-bc8c-c7ddf34cc0cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucas Film/Disney</div></figure><p>Disney previously revealed that <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/578289/hayden-christensen-obi-wan-series/">Hayden Christensen would be returning</a> to play Darth Vader, and judging from the concept art (and some training footage), he&#39;ll definitely be ready to throw down once again. (The live-action footage in today&#39;s promo is just some clever editing from the previous <em>Star Wars </em>films.) Given the relatively tepid response to <em>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</em>, it makes sense for Disney to lean more on TV productions, like <em>The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett,</em>, where it can explore new aspects of the franchise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="61657cdf85274329a645d11a37fca40f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcYPrMk12zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Perhaps not as hotly anticipated, there&#39;s also some footage from <em>Baymax!</em>, a show dedicated to the lovable healthcare robot from <em>Big Hero 6</em>. It&#39;s the second series for the franchise — following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Hero_6:_The_Series">the sequel show</a> that ran for three seasons — and from the looks of it, there&#39;ll be more focus on comedy than superhero antics.

By now, their debuts are met with an eye roll. Viewers might wonder what beloved shows or movies are now leaving Netflix to be siloed off in some walled garden of a service. But the hype around Disney+ was a bit different when it launched two years ago today, mostly because it started off with a sizable library of well-loved content, much of which had never been available on streaming before. Add in some buzzworthy new shows from big-name franchises and 116 million subscribers, and it’s safe to say that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">Disney+</a> has become a must-have channel for your streaming lineup.</p><div id="691438fddf57487d8513acde1b92135b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PAnhkop5UqM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Disney/">Disney</a> has always been ahead of the curve when it comes to finding new ways to distribute its content. In 1983 it launched The Disney Channel, a premium network that showcased Disney-owned and other family-friendly content. (The channel would later make the shift to basic cable starting in 1990.) Other corporate-content-specific cable networks like Turner Classic Movies and Cartoon Network wouldn’t debut until a decade later. Disney was also well-known for how it would re-release classic animated films in theaters every seven years or so and, once home video was a thing, would consign those same movies to the “Disney Vault” until that period of time had passed. With the advent of DVD and later Blu-ray, Disney would loosen its grip on content, making movies available through subscription services like the Disney Movie Club, and adding free digital copies with every physical media purchase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The launch of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">Disney+</a> promised an end to the Disney Vault, with every Disney animated film available to stream. Well, almost — <em>Song of the South</em> is still not available on Disney+ due to its racist content, and other shows and films have been held due to licensing restrictions. But it’s still an impressive lineup. If you wanted to give yourself a crash course in animation history Disney+ is a good service to have, home to some of the earliest Walt Disney Animation Studio films like <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>, <em>Pinocchio</em> and <em>Fantasia</em>, all the way to recent releases like <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet</em> and <em>Frozen II</em>. Plenty of shorts are available on the service, too, allowing kids and adults to check out all-time classics like <em>Steamboat Willie</em> and <em>The Brave Little Tailor</em>.</p><div id="6838a873c8b74a288f875f987828c8d1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BBgghnQF6E4?rel=0&amp;start=7" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>But while parents were happy to have a streaming service they didn’t need to put on parental lock with their kids, Disney was making a play for older folks with two franchises it had acquired over the previous decade: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel/">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20wars/">Star Wars</a>. Right out of the gate the company promised fresh content from both, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20mandalorian/"><em>The Mandalorian</em></a> debuting only weeks after the service’s launch. Alongside later Marvel Cinematic Universe shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wandavision/"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20falcon%20and%20the%20winter%20soldier/"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/loki/"><em>Loki</em></a>, Disney could lay claim to having “water cooler” shows, ones that would light up social media and hopefully win a few awards in the process. Though the company hasn’t been entirely successful in the latter category and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html">subscriber numbers </a>have stalled, it at least has programs that generate as much excitement as Netflix’s <em>Stranger Things</em> or Hulu’s <em>The Handmaid’s Tale.</em></p><p>So what’s next for Disney+? The service continues to add more programming from its big franchises, with shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-release-date-disney-plus-161153623.html"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> not far over the horizon. I’ve talked before about how Disney+ can facilitate franchise world-building thanks to the ability to have all its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">content in one place</a>, though both Star Wars and Marvel risk growing to the point where audiences may not be able to keep up with it all. The new shows and service definitely benefited from people having a lot of free time in 2020 and 2021 — it’ll be interesting to see if Disney+ can maintain its cachet as more businesses open back up. After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-release-182440824.html">getting</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">mixed results</a> with offering new movies on “Premier Access” streaming for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mulan-disney-plus-205328159.html">$30 a pop</a>, Disney has switched to offering films “only in theaters” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">again</a>, with even a divisive film like <em>Eternals</em> pulling in over $70 million on its opening weekend.</p><div id="49f1395443ca44118e87bf9f818b582d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUU8OBEXhw8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Disney+’s biggest strength today is its back catalog of content, namely the shows and movies that are still missing from the service. Some programs were held back to promote future releases. One easy example I can think of is how the Marvel One-Shot <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:All Hail the King" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/XxGnBb"><em>All Hail the King</em></a> showed up a week or two shy of the release of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/VyAYXM"><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em></a>. The short film was the last appearance of the character Trevor Slattery, who would go on to play a part in <em>Shang-Chi</em>.  One can hope this means the other One-Shots will make their way to Disney+ as their characters reappear in the Marvel films.</p><p>The same, however, cannot be said for the Hulk, whose film rights are still tangled up with Universal, making 2008’s <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> the only MCU movie still missing from Disney+  — even with a <em>She-Hulk</em> series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-disney-plus-ms-marvel-she-hulk-moon-knight.html">on deck for 2022</a>. But if Marvel could patch things up with Sony over the rights to Spider-Man to the point where the new film seems to be bringing back previous actors and introducing the older films as part of a multiverse, there’s certainly room to be surprised over on Planet Hulk.</p><div id="da3ce6e54292447d9b11b7873da213a5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaIe2FUlrlU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Other odd omissions: Disney+ has the original animated <em>Aladdin</em> film and its two direct-to-VHS sequels, but not the TV show that the two latter films bookended. At this point we don’t know if it’s a rights issue, an indication of future plans or someone just forgot the show existed.

Given that several major features, like SharePlay, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html">were delayed</a>, little seemed different from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">public beta</a>. But now, with iOS 15.1, everything seems to be in full working order. It’s time to put Apple’s latest mobile OS through its paces.</p><h2><strong>SharePlay is finally here</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ded00460-4397-11ec-baff-bed6ac4a876d" alt="iOS 15.1 review" data-uuid="7a745094-9b26-390d-b867-a10eb2814ab1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>We had to wait until iOS 15.1 for SharePlay — one of the few significant features inside this otherwise quiet update. All things SharePlay are underpinned by the FaceTime app. We have a guide to using SharePlay <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html">right here</a>, but the major point is that not all apps are compatible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You need to start a FaceTime call before doing anything SharePlay. Then, once connected to someone, you can open a supported app and you&#39;ll see an alert at the top of the screen asking if you want to stream your content to your FaceTime contact. They will then see a pop-up, asking them to join you.</p><p>Shared shows and content are impressively lag-free and can be navigated by anyone watching, so your friends can pause a TV show if they need to make a snack run. A picture-in-picture box offers a view of all the callers. It’s a little tight on an iPhone, but works well on Apple TV and iPads. When shows offer multiple subtitles and audio options, everyone can listen/read in their chosen languages.</p><p>There are also a few games compatible with SharePlay, but you’ll probably tend toward the free-to-play options, like the charades-based game, Heads-Up. (Testing it out with other Engadget editors was far more fun than it had any right to be.)</p><p>Fitness Plus, Apple’s on-demand workouts service, also works with SharePlay. Of course, you’ll need an Apple Watch to participate, but it’s a fun way to share a workout, and have someone to complain along with you. The app did an excellent job dipping out the Fitness Plus audio when my companion talked. Sometimes it’d pick up ambient noise, like distant door slams, but it was cool to be able to hear that someone else was sweating (and swearing) along with me, while still being in the privacy of my apartment.</p><p>Unfortunately, your favorite streaming service may not work on SharePlay. There’s currently no YouTube or Netflix, but Apple has managed to rope in TikTok, HBO Max, Hulu, Showtime, Paramount Plus, and the NBA. There are some third-party fitness apps (including SmartGym), but nothing hugely notable.</p><p>There is potential here, I just wish this feature weren&#39;t joined at the hip to FaceTime. I would have appreciated the ability to SharePlay from say, Apple TV+, and then put in the details of whoever I wanted to share with once I’d picked something — That order would make more sense.</p><p>While I might not be a FaceTime regular, I can appreciate the upgrades in iOS 15. For example, you can share your FaceTime calls beyond Apple’s walled garden, to anything with a web browser. This works best on Apple devices, but it’s relatively stable compared to the open beta we tried earlier this year. You’ll also immediately notice the new grid view that brings Apple up to parity with other video call services, like Google Hangouts or Zoom.</p><p>There’s also spatial audio, which makes each person on your FaceTime call sound like they’re coming from a particular direction. It’s not life-changing, but it’s a nice flourish. What’s even better are the new voice isolation and wide modes, the latter of which intentionally draws in more ambient noise. Those are also available outside of Apple’s own video call app. I inadvertently turned it on for some WhatsApp video calls with family while trying to console a cranky toddler — the caller had no idea that my niece was having a complete meltdown. Naturally, noise-cancellation effectiveness can vary, but I generally found it impressive.</p><h2><strong>Focus modes</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19b03230-42ee-11ec-af56-405d3b6e630a" alt="iOS 15 review" data-uuid="a8a3041f-f15f-3fdc-9a63-c56272a7c721"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple’s attempt to help us claw back some of our life from our smartphones is a welcome one. Compared to Screentime, which came along with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-20-apple-ios-12-review.html">iOS 12</a>, Focus seems more robust. It’s better equipped to help you steer away from your phone, and less about telling you about what you already know — you spent over 40 minutes reading Reddit when you should have been sleeping.</p><p>Focus offers multiple different profiles, evolving the single Do Not Disturb toggle from before. There are three placeholders to start with: Work, Bedtime and Personal, but there’s no stopping you from adding more focus modes to cover perhaps, gym trips or when you offer your phone to your kids.</p><p>There’s also a toggle within the Focus menus that allows compatible apps (there aren’t many) to notify anyone trying to contact you that messages were “delivered quietly.” If it’s very important, they can “send anyway” and it’ll still ping you. Of course, this is only when dealing with iOS users. Android users won’t have any hint that their message won’t be read.</p><p>In iOS 15, you can automate the transitions so that your device ‘locks you out’ when you should be filing your review draft and not mired in the latest Apple Arcade game. This can be based on location, time or even on AI smarts. The phone learns from when you manually switch between modes and will suggest the same transition, hopefully, before you do it yourself.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c82700-42ee-11ec-bf3e-7462043d8d1e" alt="iOS 15 review" data-uuid="9373d34f-62a1-3f32-bc50-5f2b09a598a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Inside the Focus settings, you can approve both apps and contacts. If they’re not on the list, notifications are corralled away until you swap modes.</p><p>You can also use Focus modes to customize your interface. Inside the settings for each mode, you’ll need to make each new home screen page as an additional panel. Once enabled, you’ll only see the panels enabled in that particular Focus mode — though the app drawer is always just a few swipes away…</p><p>If it’s any kind of endorsement, I set up a ‘sleep’ focus mode that interrupts messages and most things after 10 PM, protecting myself from some of the chaos of an international Engadget team and friends that are very much night owls. So far, it’s worked well.</p><h2><strong>A smarter iOS, again</strong></h2><p>Apple’s machine learning takes a few more  steps forward in iOS 15. They’re small additions, but they point to where Apple is taking its mobile OS.</p><p>A handful of them are based on imaging. Visual Look-up will, er, look up photos on your iPhone, identifying people, places and more. It’s something that Google’s done for years on Lens — which you could also have used on your iPhone.</p><p>Live Text is a little more compelling. It can identify and pull text from a photo, which you can then paste into emails or notes. You can even translate this text in real-time, making it useful for menus and signs as we gradually venture beyond our own borders again.</p><p>Spotlight in iOS 15 has also been given some machine-learning smarts. You can now search your Photos app without having to open the app. Type in &quot;dog,&quot; &quot;ramen&quot; or &quot;baby&quot; and you’ll see your own images of whatever you type in, if you have them. This also works for people, if you’ve assigned their faces to photos. Even more impressive, it’ll search the text within your photos, although I haven’t needed it yet. This can backfire, though: I have a photo of a Lulu Lemon tote bag (don’t ask), which is covered in random words. Apple has indexed all of them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ede93270-42f0-11ec-b7fe-8080ab473e09" alt="iOS 15 review" data-uuid="dcca086f-c1db-3a93-aeed-e14beb79f276"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Across iOS 15, you’ll notice a new “Shared with You” section that’s based entirely on your Messages app and what content and links people have sent you. You’ll see it across Safari, Photos, Podcasts, Apple Music and more.</p><p>Any content that someone shares with you on Messages will populate in the corresponding app. It works seamlessly, but it’s also only for all things Apple. I got the most use from sending and receiving photos, but I could see the utility being heavily tied to how many of my friends and family are watching TV Plus — or are iPhone users to begin with.</p><p>Safari got some surprising changes too. Yes, the address bar has now been relocated to the bottom of the screen — closer to fingers on ever bigger iPhones. While it takes a while to remember that’s where the URL box lives now, it makes sense. And, if you absolutely can’t tolerate it, you can turn off this design change. It’s a rare bit of flexibility from Apple.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3477d470-42f2-11ec-badb-830aac531158" alt="iOS 15 review" data-uuid="6a2f5200-0947-397f-877d-d90c1b9cf49a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Safari on iOS 15 also introduces extensions, like Safari has on Macs. Sadly, the best extension (and the only one I’m using) is Noir which tries to force a ‘dark mode’ effect on any websites you browse on Safari. It’s another area that could be more compelling in a year’s time.</p><p>Many of Apple’s other apps have picked up subtle upgrades too. Apple Maps continues its slow path to redemption with improved transit instructions and augmented-reality walking instructions. There’s a deeper level of detail for several cities, including New York, San Francisco and London, including bike lanes.</p><p>With the Weather app, you can now set up notifications for when it’s about to rain or snow, borrowed from Dark Sky, a weather app that Apple recently bought. And the Health app does a better job of notifying you of trends, like weight and physical activity. This week, I got a notification saying that my VO2 levels have improved since taking up daily HIIT classes, meaning that regardless of weight loss or what I see in the mirror, my cardiovascular system is getting stronger.</p><p>If you’re paying for iCloud, or Apple’s One service, you’ll get a few extras with iOS 15. It now includes a baked-in private relay that will scramble traffic at both ends of your internet connection — iOS will flag when it is turned on or off. It’s useful simply because it’s so entrenched within the OS, with no need to toggle it on or off. The paid-for service also adds the ability to make your own “burner” email addresses that auto-forward to your main email account. These work in places where the Sign in with Apple feature, which does a similar thing, isn’t supported.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h3><strong>Supported devices</strong></h3><h3></h3><p>Like iOS 14 before it, Apple supports devices from the iPhone 6s onwards, including the first iPhone SE and the 7th generation iPod touch. However, some features, especially ones that rely on AI and machine learning, depend on more modern mobile chips. You’ll need a device with an A12 chip, first used in 2018’s iPhone Xs, to use FaceTime’s new voice-isolation mode, spatial audio and its blurred-background Portrait mode. Offline Siri support and further Siri performance upgrades also need the same A12 chip or newer. The fancy cinematic video recording mode also remains exclusive to the iPhone 13 Pro models.</p></div><p></p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c17040-42ee-11ec-b91b-0b35e1ae5116" alt="iOS 15 review" data-uuid="57343a96-169d-3784-a639-7efa35a7e8fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>iOS 15 is a quiet update. It can be hard to spot what’s changed unless you’re actively seeking out the differences. This isn’t a getting-rid-of-the-home-button edition of iOS. Instead, Apple is both focusing on sharing as a way to court people outside of iOS while keeping those already committed to its apps deeply entrenched.</p><p>With FaceTime web links, SharePlay and those new Shared With You sections, the company is coaxing you into sharing photos in Messages, stretching in a Fitness Plus yoga session with friends, or watching the latest season of Ted Lasso with family hundreds of miles away.</p><p>Apple wants you doing all those things <em>Apple’s</em> way, instead of through WhatsApp, Netflix or Peleton. That’s still a big ask, but Apple has weaved all these often disparate parts together so well that it’s easy to see what it’s trying to achieve, even if the content or flexibility isn’t quite there.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2947085-4e39-46af-b5e5-f163e0c75e7d</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 15:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636739379</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T17:49:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19ca70f0-42ee-11ec-9f75-ee647fc0980a" width="2000" height="1343" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19ca70f0-42ee-11ec-9f75-ee647fc0980a" width="2000" height="1343" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bose QuietComfort 45 review: A worthy update to a noise-cancelling classic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</p><p>Bose has done exactly that with its QuietComfort line of noise-cancelling headphones — and for good reason. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-25-bose-quietcomfort-35-review.html">QC35</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-bose-qc35-headphones-google-assistant.html">QC35 II</a> set the bar for active noise cancellation (ANC) when it comes to wireless over-ear cans. Bose’s powerful ANC blocks out more ambient roar than nearly all of the competition and the QuietComfort’s reliable controls meant they were a joy to use on long flights. Still, the QC35 II debuted in 2017 and technology has progressed <em>a lot</em> since then. Still, Bose managed to keep most of what made the line so popular while making a few minor updates with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-price-specs-availability-133006735.html">QuietComfort 45</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$329" href="https://amzn.to/30fHM6C">$329</a>). As it turns out, you don’t need fancy new features to make your headphones unique.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>In terms of aesthetics, there’s almost nothing new to report here. Bose was clear that the idea was to keep the trademark QuietComfort series design intact. The company did remove the pleats around the ear pads to clean things up, and it closed open spaces for a smoother look. It also swapped out the micro-USB port for modern USB-C charging. Overall though, you could easily mistake the QC45 for a pair of QC35 or QC35 II headphones.</p><p>The QC45’s ear cups still rotate and fold in for easy storage, and both the ear pads and headband remain soft and cushiony. On the right, the power and pairing slider is on the outside of the ear cup while on-board controls are along the back edge. These physical buttons give you the ability to play/pause, take calls, skip tracks and adjust volume. In the same spot on the left, what used to be the Google Assistant and Alexa button now cycles between active noise cancellation (Quiet mode) and ambient sound (Aware mode). If you press this button during a call, it will mute the mics. You can still summon your assistant of choice, but you now do so by holding down the center multi-function button on the right side instead.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="bba517e7-bbe6-4535-952d-da3aa1dfa284"/><p>If you want something that’s a bit less of a “dad on a business trip” vibe, but still desire Bose’s sound quality and ANC chops, you’ll want to look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-16-bose-700-headphones-review.html">Bose 700</a> (more on those in a bit). Those have a more modern design. However, the entire point of the QuietComfort series is to keep you comfy for hours at a time while blocking out the world. The QC45 continues to do just that with its lightweight design that packs easy and is an excellent travel companion.</p><h2><strong>Software and features</strong></h2><p>Like other Bose headphones and earbuds, the QuietComfort 45 work with the company’s Music app. The software doesn’t offer much in terms of customization, but it will guide you through the on-board controls, display battery life, allow you to change ANC modes and switch between connected Bluetooth devices. There’s also a volume slider and a basic media controller, both of which you probably won’t need. What you are able to adjust does actually come in handy though. You can choose between four levels of Self Voice, or the amount of yourself you can hear in the headphones during calls (off, low, medium and high). This helps you be less shouty on Zoom, which is always nice. You can also adjust how long the QC45 will sit idle before automatically powering off to conserve battery.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/86596620-433b-11ec-acd0-184e457898b9" alt="With the latest installment in its popular QuietComfort lineup, Bose revisits some of its best headphones ever. The company introduced minimal changes to its recognizable design, focusing its attention on improving ANC performance and adding an ambient sound mode. Adjustable voice levels make the QC45 a solid option for calls and this new model is $30 cheaper than its predecessor. " data-uuid="b69cd173-76de-36cb-bb3f-e2418649b12f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s really it. Bose doesn’t offer the ability to tweak the EQ or even a select of presets to adjust the sound profile. Instead, the QC45 is equipped with a volume-optimized Active EQ feature that automatically adjusts highs and lows to maintain performance at all levels. There’s really no need to reassign any of the controls and features like automatic pausing or voice recognition aren’t available. This means the Music app is potentially something you’ll visit during initial setup, and never again.</p><p>Lastly, there’s one thing with the multi-device connectivity that I found frustrating. You can connect the QC45 to both your phone and your computer at the same time. This way when you’re working, you’re tuned into Slack and Spotify, but the headphones automatically switch over when you get a call. However, when that call is finished, the QC45 remains connected to your phone and you have to tap to get your computer back to the active stream. It’s a small nuisance, but when competitors do this automatically, it sticks out.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><p>You might be considering a set of Bose headphones just for their noise cancelling chops, but don’t overlook the sound quality. The company has a decent track record with tuning, typically offering warm, balanced sound with good clarity that highlights details of the music. That continues with the QuietComfort 45 as these headphones handle all genres well, offering crisp highs, robust mids and deep bass when a song demands it. The tuning here is more even-handed than what Sony offers on its flagship model, so don’t expect booming low-end.</p><p>That being said, there’s ample bass for albums like Run The Jewels’ <em>RTJ4 </em>and Chvrches’ <em>Screen Violence</em>. The difference with Bose is that the low end doesn’t have the same depth or detail as other sets. The basslines of “Walking In The Snow” and “Asking For A Friend” don’t drone or oscillate with the same immersive quality as the competition. With more balanced tuning, and thanks to how well they handle details, the QC45 is well-suited for all genres — from metal to bluegrass and everything in between. They can get loud when you need them to and there’s enough depth to keep things from any semblance of flat or boring.</p><section data-eng-breakout="124e2f895cb14273af7531bc0a894e09" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/002ef960-433c-11ec-afeb-f841991b8e6d" alt="With the latest installment in its popular QuietComfort lineup, Bose revisits some of its best headphones ever with timely upgrades."></section><p>The most notable changes to sound on the QC45 were actually made to the active noise cancellation. Bose says a combination of external and internal microphones work with a &quot;proprietary digital chip” to detect and silence more mid-range frequencies. The company explains that this should cover things like office noise, the roar of a train or the hum of a coffee shop. Indeed, these headphones are better at blocking the distractions the competition struggles with. I noticed the QC45 handled things like the TV and other sounds around the house with ease — including human voices on their own work calls. ANC performance was never an issue with Bose headphones, but the company has managed to improve on what was already top tier.</p><p>Ambient sound or Aware mode is also a new addition to the QC45. Something like this is a staple of most headphones nowadays, so it’s nice to see Bose include it. It doesn’t sound anywhere close to as natural as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a>, but it gets the job done when you need to hear what’s going on around you. The ability to adjust how much of your voice you hear on calls is also handy, since it looks like we’ll still be spending a good portion of our lives on video calls.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Bose promises up to 24 hours on a charge with the QC45, four more than the QC35 II. Obviously, that’s long enough to take any commercial flight in the world, or to get you through a few full work days with ease. During my tests using a mix of ANC and ambient sound for both music and calls, I managed 22.5 hours before having to plug in. That’s slightly under the stated figure, but still quite a long time.</p><p>If you find yourself in a pinch, Bose has included a quick-charge feature that gives you three hours of playtime in 15 minutes. It’s more than enough to get you through your commute home, a workout or a Zoom call.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/865a7790-433b-11ec-b70f-d394f34dfc02" alt="With the latest installment in its popular QuietComfort lineup, Bose revisits some of its best headphones ever.

The 2019 model offers the company’s robust ANC along with impressive voice quality for calls, even in noisy environments. You can also set the level of noise cancellation between 0 and 10. The 700 has reliable touch controls instead of physical buttons and a design that’s more modern than the QC series. They’re more expensive at $379 and the treble can be harsh at times, which isn’t great when there’s no option in the app to adjust it. Still, if looks are important to you, these are a worthy alternative.</p><p>Sony has been giving Bose a run for its money over the last few years. The company’s latest flagship noise-cancelling headphones, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">WH-1000XM4</a>, keeps that pace. Sony packs in so many handy features on top of powerful ANC and excellent sound quality. The WH-1000XM4 can automatically adjust noise cancelling based on your activity or location and speak-to-chat, along with quick-attention mode, offers a convenient way to have a quick convo. Plus, automatic pausing, multi-device connectivity and support for Sony’s 360 Reality Audio may sweeten the deal. When you consider you can sometimes find these available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-anc-headphones-sale-best-tech-deals-this-week-130021009.html">for $100 less</a> than the full asking price of around $350, the 1000XM4 becomes even more enticing.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>Bose is clearly catering to QuietComfort fans with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:QC45" href="https://amzn.to/2YGmGO9">QC45</a>. The new model maintains everything that makes this line of headphones so popular with noteworthy upgrades to noise cancellation. It’s also apparent that Bose is content to put its latest tech to work in entirely separate models like the 700, keeping the QC family going as long as there’s still demand for it. And if I had to guess, the clamoring will remain for quite some time. If Bose can manage to get the price closer to $300, future QuietComfort headphones become an even more intriguing proposition.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48047d72-dcf6-4e83-8589-6876bed30128</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 14:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636728296</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T14:45:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dfa29b70-433b-11ec-afff-774b934147e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dfa29b70-433b-11ec-afff-774b934147e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[With the latest installment in its popular QuietComfort lineup, Bose revisits some of its best headphones ever with timely upgrades.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bose QuietComfort 45 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gear to give to the photographer in your life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="9d110ec20753455c8beff09e91baa043"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DyO8bpgt0kE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>If your favorite person has a love of video or photography, a camera may be the best gift they’ll ever get.

You get a lifetime of updates, so it’s far cheaper than Adobe’s subscription program that runs $630 per year.
