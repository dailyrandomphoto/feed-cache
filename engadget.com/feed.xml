For gadget-lovers who seemingly have everything, or someone getting an exciting new piece of hardware this holiday, digital gifts can help them get even more out of things they own and love. This year, we’re including time-tested music and TV streaming services, some game subscriptions and practical options like learning services to keep your brain both calm and limber just as the new year gets here.</p><h2>Apple One</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ede1dc70-40a0-11ec-bfc7-ee12a44a9696" alt="Apple One" data-uuid="60d0181a-e53e-3ad7-bfc6-49e32b9ac287"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If you know someone with multiple Apple devices, chances are good they’re already paying for a little bit of iCloud storage, and maybe a few other Apple services like Music or Arcade as well. If that’s the case, consider gifting them an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One subscription</a>. In a single monthly charge, Apple offers a combo of Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and either 50GB, 200GB, or 2TB of iCloud storage. If you spring for the $19.95 Family plan, that 200GB can be shared with five other family members. The $29.95 plan adds subscriptions to Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ too. At this point, all of Apple’s offerings are pretty good – Arcade has a load of fun games with no ads, TV+ has <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and Music is second only to Spotify in the streaming world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" id="645f80b10ff34bdc8377ae38c6499ee5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Apple One starting at $15</a><h2>Xbox Game Pass</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d6655e0-409d-11ec-aff1-a35f96e25474" alt="Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate
" data-uuid="d750350f-8c69-34b6-af7b-c64783b6295a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Getting an Xbox Series X or Series S this holiday season is likely going to be difficult. But if you know someone who managed to get their hands on Microsoft&#39;s latest console, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Xbox Game Pass" href="https://fave.co/3v6Xg80">Xbox Game Pass</a> is an outstanding addition to their new console. A $15/month subscription offers more than 100 games that can be played on the Xbox or PC, and they can be streamed to phones and tablets as well.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes a number of other perks, including Xbox Live Gold. That&#39;s usually $10 a month on its own, and it&#39;s a requirement if you want to play games online. It also includes EA Play, which opens up access to more games for the Xbox and PC. Perhaps the best part of Xbox Game Pass, though, is that it offers access to first-party Xbox Game Studios titles the day they&#39;re released, so you don&#39;t even have to purchase them. For an Xbox owner, it&#39;s a no-brainer. If the person you’re shopping for is a PlayStation owner, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation Now" href="https://amzn.to/3ws4qo9">PlayStation Now</a> offers access to hundreds of streaming games for $60/year (or $10/month), while <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo&#x002019;s Switch Online" href="https://amzn.to/30d7Tv3">Nintendo’s Switch Online</a> unlocks online play and a large selection of NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis and N64 games for $50/year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3v6Xg80" id="9100bac04e624a80b78f95273fff9044" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Xbox Game Pass at Microsoft - $15/month</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ws4qo9" id="cabae3e9c23d4f45ad336febf51c2f68" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PS Now (12 months) at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30d7Tv3" id="6d2709de7df34bfd97b96859b2d32c6d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Switch Online (12 months) at Amazon - $20</a><h2>YouTube Premium</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d643301-409d-11ec-bffe-bb6907afbdd4" alt="YouTube Premium

Shrewdly, YouTube offers a solution. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">$12/month subscription</a> removes the ads, but there are a number of other benefits as well. If you&#39;re watching on a phone or tablet, you can download basically any video and save it for offline playback. Videos also can play in the background, which means you can switch to other apps without stopping. This comes in handy for picture-in-picture, or if you just want to hear the audio while you switch away to send a text message.</p><p>Premium also comes with a subscription to YouTube Music, the company&#39;s competitor to Spotify and Apple Music. It&#39;s a pretty solid service, and it does a few things that Apple and Spotify can&#39;t offer. For example, all of YouTube&#39;s music video content lives alongside its standard streaming catalog, which means users can build playlists that combine videos uploaded to YouTube alongside official artist releases. For $12, the combination of a better YouTube experience and a full-fledged music streaming app is a pretty good deal.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.youtube.com/premium" id="12e28dbb30a746c8bf49a735606ceaf9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:YouTube;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy YouTube Premium - $12/month</a><h2>The Disney Bundle</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d643300-409d-11ec-bffb-2c3b0c0383c4" alt="The Disney Bundle, showing logos and images of popular shows." data-uuid="a12ea77f-afa5-39da-9765-abb796085364"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney&#39;s $14/month video bundle" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/mgE321">Disney&#39;s $14/month video bundle</a> that includes Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu is a great digital gift for basically anyone who likes good entertainment. The appeal of Disney+ is well-known at this point: it includes basically all of Disney and Pixar&#39;s classic animated films, alongside basically everything in the Marvel cinematic universe, the entire<em> Star Wars</em> saga, and new original shows like <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>The Bad Batch</em> and more.</p><p>Hulu offers a vast slate of current and classic TV shows, a solid rotating selection of feature films, and a growing roster of originals. Those include <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em>,<em> Little Fires Everywhere</em>, <em>Veronica Mars</em>, <em>Shrill</em>, <em>Pen15</em> and plenty more. ESPN+, meanwhile, offers a host of live sports, including MLB games every day of the season, a wide variety of soccer leagues, golf, tennis and college games across multiple sports. Add in ESPN&#39;s <em>30 for 30</em> documentary library and a smattering of originals and the Disney bundle ends up being a great option for almost anyone — and it’s only $6 more than Disney+ on its own.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/mgE321" id="094b2a3512824c5aa4bd1ed46b3b5a49" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Disney Bundle - $14/month</a><h2>HBO Max</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d601450-409d-11ec-bffa-694b94a492f3" alt="HBO Max" data-uuid="489f82eb-f6eb-396c-a4a3-fae990840f4f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HBO Max</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HBO Max" href="https://fave.co/3dZW91S">HBO Max</a> might not have the best app we&#39;ve ever used, but it does have one of the biggest and best video libraries you can find. Its collection of original shows and films is still unrivaled in a lot of ways, from classics like <em>The Wire</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em> to newer hits like <em>Mare of Easttown</em> and <em>Succession</em>. The service also has a huge movie library, and lately it’s offered a number of movies at the same time as their theatrical release. For example, <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> is going to hit HBO Max just a few days before Christmas and will stream there for a month. Speaking of new HBO content, <em>Curb your Enthusiasm</em> is coming back to HBO for an 11th season this fall. And if you&#39;re a DC fan, HBO Max has all of the classic Batman movies (including the Dark Knight Trilogy and Michael Keaton&#39;s two films) as well as more recent films like <em>Aquaman</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em> and, of course, the infamous Synder Cut of <em>Justice League</em>. Oh yeah, it has <em>Friends</em>, too.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3dZW91S" id="063d01f72d7c4c6ba2fc972bcdb18173" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:HBO Max;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy HBO Max starting at $10/month</a><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d6125c0-409d-11ec-b72f-2c6e5c5c58e9" alt="The Headspace app seen on smartphones." data-uuid="ff96a7a9-72cb-3f0c-9def-4c4ab1d6703d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>Chances are good that, after the year we&#39;ve all had, you know someone whose mental health could use a little bit of a boost.

In a nutshell, it plays algorithmically-generated soundscapes for a variety of different scenarios. Whether you&#39;re actively on-the-go, want to get some work done, need to relax, or get some sleep, Endel will produce a soundtrack to help you achieve your goal.</p><p>If you give it permission to collect data from your phone (and Apple Watch, if you have one), it can adjust its soundscapes based on things like your heart rate, time of day, location, weather, and so on. Endel is also frequently adding scenarios — recently, the company added study and recovery, and it also has something called an AI Lullaby that was created in partnership with Grimes. At $10 per month or $60 per year, it&#39;s a solid relaxation tool, and I&#39;ve also found it to be particularly useful as a soundtrack when you want to just sit down and focus on a craft, like writing or art.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3oX2tyu" id="a4d76e7e36304567b055f271ceebd287" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Endel;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Endel Premium - $10/month</a><h2>Codecademy</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d65b9a0-409d-11ec-a1ff-707d4e8a01d8" alt="Code Academy for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

The idea is that you should have perfectly cooked food every time without having to keep a close eye on it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can adjust the settings using Anova&#39;s companion app or the on-device controls. The app has thousands of free recipe suggestions as well, so you&#39;ll always have something new to try.</p><p>The Precision Cooker Pro is Anova&#39;s most powerful sous vide device. It can heat up to 20 gallons of water using 1,200 watts of power. Anova says the device can run for up to 10,000 hours before shutting down. It&#39;s a fairly sturdy machine too. The Precision Cooker Pro is made with stainless steel and should withstand accidental drops. It&#39;s IPX-7 rated as well, so if you dunk it in water by mistake, it should still work.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anova-sous-vide-precision-cooker-pro-half-price-amazon-good-deal-150721840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">324afad7-4d7e-44ce-b240-d5b590dfe8ee</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 15:07:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636383808</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T15:03:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/eaf13e10-ab0b-11ea-bf3f-a50ab0e0075d" width="960" height="631" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/eaf13e10-ab0b-11ea-bf3f-a50ab0e0075d" width="960" height="631" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anova]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anova Sous Vide]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anova Sous Vide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a seven-mile delivery loop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-gatik-pilot-expansion-222524778.html">promised</a>, Walmart has started doing fully driverless box truck deliveries in partnership with startup Gatik between its own locations on a fixed 7-mile loop, the companies <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005409/en/Gatik-and-Walmart-Achieve-Fully-Driverless-Deliveries-in-a-First-for-Autonomous-Trucking-Industry-Worldwide">announced</a>. Despite those limitations, the route in Bentonville, Arkansas involves &quot;intersections, traffic lights and merging on dense urban roads,&quot; the companies said. It&#39;s another shot of good news for the progress of self-driving vehicles after GM&#39;s cruise launched its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-cruise-is-now-offering-driverless-taxi-rides-in-san-francisco-103542426.html">self-driving taxis</a> into testing last week.&nbsp;</p><p>The Gatik trucks are bringing grocery orders from a Walmart fulfilment center (dark store) to a nearby Walmart Neighborhood Market grocery store in Bentonville, the host city of the company&#39;s headquarters. The route covers the &quot;middle mile&quot; transportation of goods between warehouses and stores. The program effectively got launched following the December 2020 approval by the Arkansas State Highway Commission, and has been driverless since this summer.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9e5398794d454359b8ae6c6a76d6219f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Br1vU2Xcr-o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The new service is part of Walmart&#39;s transition to a hub-and-spoke model with warehouses or fulfilment centers closer to customers. Doing so means smaller warehouses, so &quot;there is a growing need for doing repeated trips from the fulfilment centers to the pickup points,&quot; Gatik CEO Gautam Narang told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/walmart-is-using-fully-driverless-trucks-to-ramp-up-its-online-grocery-business.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. &quot;That&#39;s where we come in.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart isn&#39;t the first superstore to go fully driverless, as Kroger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-18-kroger-adds-driverless-vehicles-grocery-delivery-fleet.html">teamed up</a> with self-driving startup Nuro for grocery deliveries back in 2018. However, at launch, Nuro&#39;s delivery vehicles were tiny microvans, while Walmart and Gatik are using full-sized box trucks.&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart and Gatik are running similar trials around New Orleans with electric box trucks, delivering directly to a customer pickup location. However, those are currently being operated with safety drivers aboard, so the Arkansas trial is the first truly driverless route. &quot;Our deployment in Bentonville is not a one-time demonstration,&quot; said Narang. &quot;These are frequent, revenue-generating, daily runs that our trucks are completing safely in a range of conditions on public roads, demonstrating the commercial and technical advantages of fully driverless operations on the middle mile.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/walmart-is-using-driverless-trucks-to-complete-a-7-mile-delivery-loop-143016425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb60afd1-2308-4f1b-a3fe-d6e99748f60e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:28:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636381719</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T14:28:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/787fe940-409b-11ec-bd57-de7044171ae2" width="1800" height="1070" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/787fe940-409b-11ec-bd57-de7044171ae2" width="1800" height="1070" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Walmart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a 7-mile delivery loop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a 7-mile delivery loop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[These are the audio gadgets to gift this season]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="4956f6ff4564460fb197d68143ba1619"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47D6BSj-gPY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The holidays are always a good time to help someone upgrade their audio setup, whether that’s earbuds, headphones, speakers or something else.

Inside, the Onyx packs a THX AAA-78 amplifier chip: the highest-powered mobile THX Achromatic Audio Amplifier configuration. THX says the AAA-78 makes the Onyx just as powerful as a desktop DAC or amplifier setup, but it&#39;s much smaller. The chip reduces three types of distortion by up to 40dB and maximizes output power for more dynamic range and sound pressure level (SPL). That’s a lot of power in a tiny device.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/302kUb2" id="de066bbb769f43f88c8e46c7e0b615b2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy THX Onyx at Razer - $200</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-headphones-speakers-audio-180019755.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9a7e3cf-4803-3d9b-af3d-f345ed41e6e9</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:15:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636380915</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T14:15:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sony]]></category><category><![CDATA[elektron]]></category><category><![CDATA[anker]]></category><category><![CDATA[audioengine]]></category><category><![CDATA[giftguide20]]></category><category><![CDATA[arturia]]></category><category><![CDATA[headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[moog]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[hgg2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[teenageengineering]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[VMHoliday2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[audio-technica]]></category><category><![CDATA[cooperfx]]></category><category><![CDATA[speakers]]></category><category><![CDATA[jabra]]></category><category><![CDATA[holiday20]]></category><category><![CDATA[sonos]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b30d73e0-4099-11ec-b777-c5a92f12f971" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b30d73e0-4099-11ec-b777-c5a92f12f971" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of audio products from the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide - audio gear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney+ will let you watch 'Shang-Chi' and 12 Marvel films in a large IMAX format]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Marvel&#39;s superheroes are about to get a bit bigger on your TV. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+ announced" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">Disney+ announced</a> today that it&#39;s adding an expanded IMAX aspect ratio for 13 Marvel titles, including <em>Shang-Chi</em> and <em>Black Panther, </em>on November 12th (AKA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shang-chi-disney-plus-release-date-203743090.html">&quot;Disney+ Day&quot;</a>). The 1.90:1 IMAX aspect ratio will look up to 26 percent taller than the typical 2.35:1 widescreen format in Marvel films, so those annoying black bars will almost disappear while you&#39;re watching scenes shot in IMAX. (You&#39;ll still see some slight bars, though, as the IMAX format doesn&#39;t completely fill 16x9 widescreen TVs.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-9f6c-2e83d138eada" alt="Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi" data-uuid="b1ab7d32-b914-3998-890d-2dca4e2c87cf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p>Before this Disney+ partnership, IMAX and DTS brought the &quot;<a href="https://www.imaxenhanced.com/">IMAX Enhanced</a>&quot; home viewing format to a handful of TV streaming apps, like Sony&#39;s Bravia Core. IMAX-ified films will have a prominent label on their Disney+ screens, and you&#39;ll also be able to launch the standard widescreen version if you prefer. Physical Blu-ray collectors are already used to shifting IMAX aspect ratios in some films, most notably <em>The Dark Knight, Tenet</em> and <em>Mission Impossible: Fallout</em>, but streaming films have typically lost on this perk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expanded aspect ratio should give Marvel&#39;s action sequences more room to pop on your TV, and it&#39;s a feature Disney+ can lord over its streaming competitors. You&#39;ll also see a wider image on smartphones, PCs and anywhere else you can view Disney+. Technically, IMAX Enhanced isn&#39;t delivering the large film format&#39;s true aspect ratio, which is more square. But, as we saw with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-hbo-max-fandom-133004404.html"><em>Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League</em></a>, that leads to enormous (and ugly) black bars on the sides of your TV. It&#39;s also worth noting that we won&#39;t see IMAX versions of <em>The Avengers</em> and <em>Ant-Man</em>, as those are the rare Marvel films that used the <a href="https://neiloseman.com/aspect-ratio-and-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/">TV-filling 1.85:1 aspect ratio</a> (a choice made to convey a better sense of height).</p><p>Looking ahead, IMAX Enhanced will also bring immersive DTS sound to Disney+, a competing option to the more ubiquitous Dolby Atmos format. Representatives from all of the companies involved tell us that IMAX Enhanced films will also support Dolby Vision, HDR10, 4K (naturally) and Dolby Atmos sound.</p><div id="0b210c1353014c708d6ef52e0cc27d54"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uxOvXM7eBc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Here are all the IMAX Enhanced films <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impact radius;pdid:arriving on Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">arriving on Disney+</a> on November 12th:</p><ul><li><p><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Panther</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Widow</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain Marvel</em></p></li><li><p><em>Doctor Strange</em></p></li><li><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy 1 &amp; 2</em></p></li><li><p><em>Iron Man</em></p></li><li><p><em>Thor Ragnarok</em></p></li><li><p><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em><br><br></p></li></ul>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7cee7ad-53b0-47dd-9848-586b0c78f603</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636385020</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T15:23:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Marvel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops to a new record low of $800]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even with the high-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">MacBook Pros</a> now available, we still consider the MacBook Air M1 to be the best Apple laptop for most people.

It&#39;s a small detail, but it makes the experience of using the laptop much better — and you&#39;ll be able to do so for a long time thanks to the MacBook Air&#39;s 16-hour battery life. Arguably the biggest downsides to the Air M1 come from its svelteness: it only has two USB-C ports, which is in stark contrast to the new MacBook Pros&#39; wide array of useful connectors. But if you can deal with the dongle life for a bit, the MacBook Air M1 will likely serve you well as your daily driver.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-drops-to-new-record-low-of-800-131618656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a428c1c-5e5e-4841-b823-9eb1542a7766</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 13:16:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636377381</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T13:16:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13a6e560-0747-11ec-adef-468b93b5e070" width="2000" height="1357" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13a6e560-0747-11ec-adef-468b93b5e070" width="2000" height="1357" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple&#39;s MacBook Air M1 drops to a new record low of $800]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WH-XB910 ANC headphones are $110 off in one-day Amazon sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has the best in-ear and over-the-ear wireless ANC headphones on the market right now, but it also has some of the best mid-range models.

Now, it has released the three-axis Crane M3 designed for mirrorless cameras, with some interesting new features like a tiny LED light and a built-in screen.</p><p>The Crane M3 is about the size of a water bottle and offers tilt, roll and pan axes with locks for each. It works with smartphones and 90 percent of mirrorless cameras, Zhiyun notes. It has a smart new white and black chassis that the company says delivers a better gripping and user experience. It also offers upgraded motors with stronger torque than the original Crane 3.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A key feature is the quick-release design with different plates that lets you change rapidly between different sized cameras (action and mirrorless, for instance), without the need to rebalance. It also has a quarter-inch adapter so you can connect a professional microphone to an expansion base and run a second cable to the camera. A mic or other accessory can then be attached to a quarter-inch threaded expansion port. Zhiyun is even selling its own shotgun mic in one of the packages, or you can connect other models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/911b26b0-4080-11ec-8ffa-7ddd55b8d1cd" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="0726ed00-9cdc-3e43-9cc2-e0701e53a686"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>The most noticeable feature, though, is an 800-lumen 6 watt dual-color LED light. It&#39;s designed for &quot;impromptu low-light shooting,&quot; Zhiyun notes, with full stepless dimming control and temperature settings via a control wheel. The light is softened with a translucent filter, though it&#39;s largely designed for run-and-gun shooting.</p><p>Other features include Bluetooth (or USB-C) control of supported cameras and a joystick and wheel to control, roll axis, aperture, shutter and ISO. If you&#39;d rather not set controls using the smartphone app, it also offers a 1.22-inch full-color interactive touchscreen to change mode settings (portrait, vortex and go modes), as well as follow speed. It also shows camera operational status, gimbal connection and battery levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Zhiyun sent me a unit to try out, complete with the expansion plate, so I attached a Panasonic GH5 II. While some functions weren&#39;t working (like the camera app), it was one of the easier gimbals to balance that I&#39;ve tried and it&#39;s certainly easy to detach and attach the camera using the quick release plates. The ability to connect a microphone away from the camera is also smart, reducing complexity and rebalancing, though you&#39;d need some accessories to attach a decent-sized microphone.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7d91ee30-4080-11ec-affc-d20b758f54b4" style="height:1088;width:1920;" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="32511dbb-0ae7-3f86-845d-aa88a521b71a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>Operation was smooth, with controls well placed for manual operations. The touchscreen was nice, though it&#39;s relatively easy to hit it by mistake — I did so once and accidentally changed the language. The lighting feature works great in a pinch, but because of the small size, it casts some harsh shadows. Hopefully all the features I didn&#39;t get to try, including app support, will be available soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Zhiyun Crane M3 is <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__store.zhiyun-2Dtech.com_products_crane-2Dm3-3Futm-5Fsource-3Dmk-26utm-5Fmedium-3Dpr&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=xBh4qrZHzH-A4SJ2NivNNdBzNWZBAjTsDJEJZG5k5-s&amp;m=b9Cpt14Rn7N4EfLrINHuOqfTXUTMTVS_wIyE2aJSs9o&amp;s=C6Q2UTeWQWRReHwkQHB1BxVNZ-Y2Mt4IA76odOBbTwA&amp;e=">now available</a> to order starting at $369 (£369) for the standard package, $449 (£449) for the combo package with a backpack, cellphone mount and Tripod Plus, or $649 (£649) for the Pro package, including all the above plus the TransMount Shotgun Microphone and TransMount Expansion Base.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zhiyuns-latest-gimbal-has-an-led-light-and-small-display-110014863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7024bd88-a901-429a-a679-11c457f23669</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 11:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636370658</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T11:24:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af249100-4085-11ec-93fa-9fb30ab63648" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af249100-4085-11ec-93fa-9fb30ab63648" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zhiyun's three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zhiyun's three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney+ special offer cuts subscriptions to $2 for the first month]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of Disney+ Day on November 12th, Disney is trying to tempt folks to its streaming service with an offer of <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">one month for just $2</a>, it <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">announced</a>.

Just remember that it will revert to the regular $8 price a month later, so don&#39;t forget to cancel if you don&#39;t want to keep it.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-is-offering-a-month-of-its-streaming-service-for-2-091849605.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa268888-ebd6-412a-bbe7-d994a25567b8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 09:18:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636363133</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T09:19:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43537320-4070-11ec-bf76-c40f83e02270" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43537320-4070-11ec-bf76-c40f83e02270" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ is offering a month of its streaming service for $2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ is offering a month of its streaming service for $2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple fixes macOS Monterey flaw that bricked some T2 Macs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">MacOS Monterey</a> didn&#39;t have the most graceful launch for some users. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/05/apple-rolls-out-fix-for-macos-monterey-bug-that-bricked-some-macs-with-the-t2-chip/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, Apple told YouTuber Rene Ritchie it <a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1456672355992866816">fixed</a> a firmware issue preventing some Macs with T2 security chips from starting.

The hard way, apparently. In his &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on/">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman (with help from developer Steve Moser) claimed to have seen code indicating Netflix would release all its games &quot;individually&quot; on iOS, through the App Store. They won&#39;t all be downloadable and playable within the app, Gurman added.</p><p>The main Netflix app would still offer access to the game catalog, but you&#39;d merely be launching a separate app when you tap a game. That&#39;s currently how it works with Android, but Netflix has the option of folding games into its Android app. On iOS, it would have no choice but to make games available separately. Apple requires that every game on the App Store receive an individual screening, even if it&#39;s only available through the cloud.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You could see this coming in light of Apple&#39;s approach, but it still indicates that Netflix will have to make some compromises if it&#39;s going to bring mobile games to iOS. This also underscores a growing rivalry between Apple and Netflix, as Gurman explained. The two are competing on an increasing number of fronts, ranging from gaming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">streaming video services</a>, but neither can afford to estrange the other.

There may be an explanation for that momentary anguish, though. Google is <a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1457043416139898881">telling</a> users that the Pixel 6&#39;s fingerprint reader is using &quot;enhanced security algorithms&quot; that may either take longer to check your digits or require better sensor contact.</p><p>Google hasn&#39;t elaborated on its statement.

However, Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qoayk3/made_by_google_the_pixel_6_fingerprint_sensor/">noted</a> there are phones with optical sensors that perform faster, such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9</a>.

Whether or not it can, it&#39;s unlikely to provide an alternative beyond entering your passcode. Face unlock is typically insecure without a depth sensor present, as facial recognition systems can sometimes be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-facial-recognition-fooled-masks.html">fooled by masks</a> and photos.

The country&#39;s Interior Ministry said the attack involved three drones, including at least one bomb-laden vehicle. Six bodyguards were injured during the incident, and an official speaking talking to <em>Reuters</em> claimed security forces obtained the remnants of a small drone at the scene.</p><p>While the Iraqi government publicly said it was &quot;premature&quot; to identify culprits, <em>CBS</em> sources suspected the perpetrators belonged to pro-Iranian militias that have used similar tactics against Erbil International Airport and the US Embassy. The militias directly blamed al-Kadhimi for casualties in a fight between Iraqi security forces and pro-militia protesters who objected to their side&#39;s losses in an October 10th parliamentary vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Iraq, the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran have publicly condemned the attack.

ISIS, for instance, modified off-the-shelf drones to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-16-isis-drones-weaponized-bombers-iraq-mosul.html">drop explosives</a>. Attacks against political leaders are still very rare, though.

The details of the lobbying weren&#39;t revealed in the public disclosure, but the description suggested you would hail a taxi from the Uber app like you could in the company&#39;s earlier days.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Uber for comment, although it declined to speak to <em>The Post</em>. A TLC spokesperson shied away from discussing details, saying only that the Commission &quot;meets frequently&quot; with licensees to explore ideas and that it was focused on relief efforts for drivers struggling with taxi medallion debt.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yellow cab hailing might seem an unusual choice for a company that has routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">clashed with the taxi industry</a> and is frequently blamed for gutting NYC&#39;s cab demand. Uber would likely have to rethink its commissions to compensate taxi drivers who pay steep costs to operate in the city, and it could still face political opposition given its history.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to see why Uber might consider offering NYC taxis. The revival would increase the chances of passengers scoring some kind of ride through the Uber app, even if there aren&#39;t enough ridesharing drivers to go around. That could keep New Yorkers using the Uber app and increase the chances they&#39;ll use the company&#39;s more familiar options.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-new-york-city-yellow-taxi-cab-dispatch-171021741.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24e6d4dd-15a1-4c62-a045-5b018a5ae940</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636305024</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T17:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VIEW press via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 16: Yellow cabs and Uber car drive through Times Square on November 16, 2020 in New York City.

They deliver a balanced sound with an adaptive EQ (to optimize for your ear) and solid active noise cancellation. You can expect healthy battery life, convenient controls and tight integration with Apple devices — the usual setup and device switching headaches won&#39;t be an issue. They&#39;ve become more valuable over time, too. Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">Apple Music offers spatial audio</a>, you can immerse yourself in songs that take advantage of the all-enveloping sound stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some familiar caveats still apply.

It’s something she does throughout the first four episodes of <em>Arcane</em>, the Netflix series based on <em>League of Legends</em> lore, and it’s a tiny yet charming habit. Vi’s leg shakes up and down with anxious anger as she argues with her friend from a squashed armchair in their makeshift lair; later, her knee bounces as she sits alone in a dark room, facing certain doom. It’s something that makes Vi feel real, like she has a history that she carries with her, as natural as her pink hair.</p><p>Even though <em>Arcane </em>is packed with incredible action and delicious animation, small details like these truly bring the world to life — only for Jinx to blow it all to smithereens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa211-3dc6-11ec-b6e5-582f0cb3c203" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="4842e494-0d07-31cd-9970-98c201d2ac6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><strong><em>Warning: Slight spoilers for the first four episodes of </em></strong><strong>Arcane</strong><strong><em> ahead.</em></strong></p><p><em>Arcane</em> begins with a quintessential story of class warfare, depicting violent clashes between the rich citizens of Piltover and the oppressed, criminal society of Zaun, where Vi, Jinx and their crew live. In the first three episodes, Vi and Jinx are kids: Vi is the leader of a small gang of teen outlaws, while Jinx — who actually goes by Powder at this time — is her little sister, a few years of heist experience and growth spurts behind the others. By the fourth episode, Vi and Jinx are older and on equal footing, even when they find themselves on opposite sides.</p><p>The sisters start out surrounded by their chosen family members, including their father figure, Vander, who acts as the unofficial mayor of Zaun. A former leader of the resistance, Vander runs a bar called The Last Drop and tries to keep the peace with the Enforcers, Piltover’s militarized security team. Meanwhile, scientists in Piltover are on the verge of harnessing synthetic magic, while the most vile forces in Zaun are creating monster soldiers by feeding people shimmering purple liquid. Altogether, it’s a recipe for war.</p><div id="70a64e99187f4c27ad384cc5bc6e6c98"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Arcane</em>’s disparate worlds are vibrant, vast and alive, Piltover shining gold among the clouds and Zaun buried beneath the dirt, filled with toxic green light. The show itself feels less like anime and more like an almost-R-rated Disney film, with buttery-smooth character movements and elaborate environments, courtesy of Riot Games’ go-to animation studio, Fortiche Production. The entire thing looks as if it were the product of motion-capture technology, but it’s hand-animated in a mix of 2D and 3D.</p><p>The fights in <em>Arcane</em> are particularly gorgeous. Vi is a boxer, diving in with her fists raised, while Jinx has a bunch of semi-functional homemade grenades covered in crayon scribbles, allowing her to participate from afar — even though she wants to be with the big kids, in the center of the action. The largest battles tend to play out in slow-motion, with emotional electronic music thrumming through the scenes and close-up shots of vicious punches, heavy kicks and last-second dodges. In wider angles, every frame of these fights has desktop-wallpaper potential.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f905b5d0-3dc7-11ec-b5fd-1f9dfff67124" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="067cbc52-a512-359f-84f7-9de16ff01b3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><em>Arcane </em>takes its time establishing characters and revealing how they’re all intertwined, and by the end of episode three, this work crashes into a massive fight scene and pays off in a powerful way. In <em>League of Legends </em>lore, Vi and Jinx are bitter rivals, but in <em>Arcane</em>, they start off as sisters with a deep, true love for one another. They support each other, save each other’s lives, and fall apart together. They feel inseparable. It takes something catastrophic to rip them apart, and <em>Arcane</em> shows us every horrific second. It’s heartbreaking.</p><p>It’s not all about Vi and Jinx, and there are plenty of other <em>League of Legends</em> characters with starring roles in <em>Arcane</em>, including Viktor, Jayce, Ekko, Caitlyn and Heimerdinger. As a fan of the game, I feel a happy spark whenever I recognize a face or name in <em>Arcane</em>, but it won’t detract from the experience if you don’t already know who these people are. This is an origin story, after all.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cfa1d47f4a8d4378a17364bb3692341b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa210-3dc6-11ec-af3b-57f2067665d8" alt="Arcane"></section><p>Episode four, which will hit Netflix along with two other episodes on November 13th, fast-forwards to a time when Jinx and Vi look more like their in-game character models, and it establishes the groundwork for a future confrontation — family reunion? — between the two. Jinx and Vi are both haunted by their pasts, and their evolution is captivating. The story spins out around them, tantalizing and tense.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>might ruin me. The show quickly and effortlessly establishes connections with its characters, bolstered by an enchanting animation style and emotional, raw voice acting. It’s making me feel things, and I’m only four episodes in. The first batch of three <em>Arcane</em> episodes is on Netflix today, November 6th, while the second bunch will land on November 13th, and the final three will hit on November 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b9cd0c21-140f-479e-a644-5248f7f1fcad</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 02:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636132210</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T17:10:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft OneDrive app will stop syncing with Windows 7 and 8 on March 1st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is trying to nudge more people toward newer Windows versions.

You can still use the web to manually transfer files, but that&#39;s clearly a hassle if you routinely access cloud files from an older PC.</p><p>Business customers won&#39;t have much of a reprieve, either.

You might need to temper your expectations. <em>Android Authority</em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/">tests</a> suggest the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro doesn&#39;t come close to hitting that 30W ceiling. In practice, the charger topped out at 22W — not much better than the 18W charger from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5</a>.</p><p>The phones appear to meet Google&#39;s claims of reaching a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. Charging tapers off very quickly after that, though, and the phone drops from the newer USB Power Delivery PPS charging standard to the old PD 2.0 specification once the battery reaches 75 percent. You don&#39;t save much time with the 30W brick, with the largest savings at the 50 percent mark (31 minutes versus 40).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-specs-price-cameras-snapdragon-888-160013665.html">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> pulls more overall power through the same charger, tapers off less aggressively and keeps using the newer charging standard the entire time, according to the test results.

It&#39;s also important to stress that Google&#39;s marketers don&#39;t promise 30W charging, just the half-hour quick charge. That&#39;s not what a 30W charger implies, however, and the familiar charging profile hints the Pixel 6 might need a software update to reach its full potential.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-30w-fast-charging-claims-184122408.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1fcdf9bf-f726-46af-9911-1069d5580178</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 18:41:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636224084</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T18:41:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/89196810-3f2b-11ec-b6ed-db4c94952034" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/89196810-3f2b-11ec-b6ed-db4c94952034" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy S22 Ultra photo leak appears to show the S-Pen]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung might just revive the S-Pen with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-plus-ultra-design-leaks-144617511.html">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> after all. <em>Front Page Tech</em> has <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/11/05/exclusive-first-real-life-photos-of-samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra/">obtained</a> photos of what it claims are the first live photos of the (apparently finished) S22 Ultra, and it&#39;s effectively the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-s-pen-price-140017843.html">Galaxy Note</a>.

Billy Steele checked out the Beats Fit Pro and liked them for their improved fit and deeper sound. Next, a few items of note for photography enthusiasts: Steve Dent reviewed the Panasonic GH5 II to see the difference an all-new processor can make, while Mat Smith used the Sony Xperia 1 III and reported that the oblong smartphone has a slew of intriguing camera features to offer. Finally, Nathan Ingraham reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, which left him suitably impressed.</p><h2>The Beats Fit Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">packed with Apple tech</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ba28f940-3e61-11ec-9ef7-09a4884e4f92" alt="Beats Fit Pro" data-uuid="bcbdaf51-767f-3eac-b149-3b8da4ab398f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the more traditional fit of the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beat Fits Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3wohfzN">Beat Fits Pro</a> earbuds. These are the newest true wireless buds in the company’s lineup and they have a slight design update with flexible wingtips, which bend to fit more ear shapes. Billy says this element helped keep the buds in place and he hardly noticed them in his ears. In addition to the hardware refresh, the earbuds also feature active noise-cancellation (ANC), adaptive EQ and spatial audio, plus other features integrated with iOS that make them an attractive option for iPhone users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The $200 Beat Fits Pro also have an IPX4 rating, and their wingtips make them more secure during workouts. The upgrades the company made to the sound profile were immediately noticeable according to Billy, who reported a punchier bass with more depth, more room for vocals and other elements and more low-end tone. The buds have the same H1 chip found in the AirPods Pro, allowing them to access features like one-touch pairing and hands-free Siri. But the Beats Fit Pro weren’t without issue: Billy experienced a lot of accidental button presses and they don’t support wireless charging. But they still offer a good blend of features, sound and performance, making them a solid alternative to the AirPods Pro.</p><h2>The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html">better than ever</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ebb6fa70-3e61-11ec-8fee-c52d6cecda1a" alt="Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition" data-uuid="bdd49ec4-7fa9-3516-a91e-829b5e21642c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham knows that an e-reader isn’t a gadget that most people upgrade often. However, a larger 6.8-inch screen, smaller bezels, 17 LED backlights, USB-C charging and 32GB of storage make for quite an update, and because of all that, Nathan calls the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition" href="https://amzn.to/3q7rtDL">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> the best e-reader he’s ever used. Those extra LEDs emit an adjustable warm light that should reduce eye strain at night, and Nathan says this was his favorite new feature on the device. He also said the hardware changes to the bezels and screen helped to make this feel like a more premium device.</p><p>The latest Kindle can also automatically adjust the backlight to reduce nighttime eye strain, plus it has wireless charging and won’t display ads on the lock screen. Like previous versions, the Signature Edition is waterproof, can play audiobooks using Bluetooth and has a battery life that lasts weeks. But it comes in at $190, which is $50 more than the standard Kindle Paperwhite. Nathan says that for most people, the extra storage isn’t worth the extra money — unless you plan on downloading a lot of Audible titles on your e-reader.</p><h2>The Panasonic GH5 II <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html">runs on an all-new processor</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/300d7c30-3e62-11ec-aee9-a053bc5b0187" alt="Panasonic GH5 II" data-uuid="deeed504-34d4-3746-99d8-69a98b5cdcf7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent found a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Panasonic GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">Panasonic GH5 II</a>. The refreshed design still has the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, as well as the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification. The body hardware is nearly identical with an excellent grip, logical control positions and a smaller but brighter rear display. However, the new version of the camera has a faster processor and double the refresh rate at 120Hz. The chip helps improve the AI autofocus, which can now double the face- and eye-tracking speeds as well as pick up focus on a face tilted away from the camera.</p><p>Steve also liked the menus better on the GH5 II, which are color coded and tabbed to help you find what you’re looking for. Panasonic also kept the info panel, which shows important settings at a glance. Another upgrade comes in the image stabilization system, which now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection. Thanks to this, Steve said the GH5 II does a better job than competitors at smoothing out walking or running. But there’s still no external RAW video, and low-light shooting remains a weak point.</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html">It&#39;s all about the cameras</a> on the Sony Xperia 1 III</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/648ea5b0-3e62-11ec-9f7f-6f0769f391aa" alt="Sony Xperia 1 II" data-uuid="f6ecd9b9-d9cc-3a49-8ba0-9986fc4c6920"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#x002019;s Xperia 1 III" href="https://amzn.to/3mOu7w8">Sony’s Xperia 1 III</a> closely resembles last year&#39;s smartphone with an unusual 21:9 screen ratio and an elongated design. Mat Smith says the addition of a matte finish helps to make it feel like a premium handset. The updated 4K 120Hz screen also helps make everything look quite crisp, and it runs smoothly thanks to a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Though Mat says the phone&#39;s 6.5-inch OLED screen is gorgeous, the Xperia can’t dynamically change refresh rates to maximize battery life — and that results in barely a full day of use, even with a 4,500mAh battery, if you keep the panel at 120Hz. He was pleased with the sound from the front-facing stereo speakers, which continues support for audio formats like 360 Reality Audio, Hi-Resolution audio and Dolby Atmos. And — shocker — the Xperia 1 III still includes a 3.5mm audio jack.</p><p>But the phone’s camera shines, courtesy of the three 12-megapixel shooters with varying focal lengths. The Xperia 1 III can track moving subjects and catch crisp shots in busy scenes because it’s capable of capturing 20 frames per second and has dual-phase-detection-autofocus pixels. Mat says it’s a more technical approach and it has a learning curve, but it makes the smartphone an intriguing prospect for photography enthusiasts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-the-beats-fit-pro-are-an-intriguing-airpods-pro-alternative-160023697.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">95efa7f5-d8bb-4a96-9a88-7e21c782e5a7</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137402</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:36:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple’s new AirPods in a less polarizing design.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
