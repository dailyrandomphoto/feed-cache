This time, though, Valve is getting ahead of the curve. It confirmed when the next three sales will take place.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-26-valve-confirms-steam-halloween-autumn-and-winter-sale-dates"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a>, the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/upcoming_events">Steamworks Documentation page</a> notes that the Steam Halloween sale is this weekend and it runs between October 28th and November 1st. The autumn sale will take place from November 24th-30th. As for the Steam winter sale, one of the platform&#39;s two biggest sales of the year alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-summer-sale-2021-best-deals-mass-effect-cyberpunk-2077-182930997.html">summer edition</a>, you&#39;ll be able to score discounts on a ton of games between December 22nd and January 5th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not a bad idea to reveal the dates well in advance. Steam connoisseurs know the sales are coming anyway and the dates are less important than announcing which games will be included beforehand. If a player knows that a game they want to buy will likely get a hefty discount in a couple of months, they&#39;ll be less inclined to buy it now. In any case, Steam users now know when they&#39;ll be able to stockpile games for their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-teardown-211025030.html"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-halloween-autumn-winter-sales-dates-171627417.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7560f6a0-f421-47eb-8d48-e3b70e842731</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:16:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635267877</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T17:04:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2018-12/a5c5b980-f58e-11e8-85f4-f178c5525aaf" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2018-12/a5c5b980-f58e-11e8-85f4-f178c5525aaf" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The front portal to Valve's Steam game client]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The front portal to Valve's Steam game client]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm's Snapdragon 695 brings faster 5G to low-cost phones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-moto-one-5g-ace-moto-g-power-moto-g-play-moto-g-stylus-2021-140034669.html">5G phones are more affordable</a>, Qualcomm wants to make those low-cost devices more desirable. The company has <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/10/26/qualcomm-upgrades-mobile-roadmap-deliver-increased-capabilities-across">introduced</a> three new systems-on-chip that all promise improved performance for budget 5G hardware. The star is easily the Snapdragon 695. This 6nm-based sequel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-690-sub-6-5g-cheap-020031041.html">the 690</a> adds much faster millimeter wave 5G (important for carriers like AT&amp;T and Verizon) while delivering up to 30 percent faster graphics and 15 percent speedier CPU tasks. Your next mid-range phone might be that much better-suited to gaming and giant downloads.</p><p>The Snapdragon 480 Plus and 778G Plus, meanwhile, are iterations of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-143023744.html">the 480</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-778g-5g-6nm-chip-150029217.html">778G</a> that deliver minor gains to CPU and GPU performance through increased clock speeds. Think of them as tune-ups for entry-level and upper-mid-range phones, respectively — you won&#39;t have to make do with a chip several months old.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a lone LTE chip, the Snapdragon 680, that shares the 695&#39;s 6nm process without the added costs of 5G. It&#39;s aimed at markets where 5G service is either limited or too expensive.</p><p>All four parts are due to reach shipping products before the end of 2021. Honor, Motorola, Nokia (that is, HMD Global), Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi all expect to use one or more of the new Snapdragons in their phones.</p><p>There&#39;s a pragmatism at work. The 6nm parts (including the 778G Plus) help Qualcomm continue to serve a large chunk of the smartphone market despite limited supplies of 5nm parts like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-annoucement-140044615.htmlhttps://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-780g-annoucement-140044615.html">the 780G</a>. It doesn&#39;t have to rely on truly old process lStill, it&#39;s notable that the chip maker is launching so many speed-bumped chips in the first place — the company is clearly determined to fend off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mediatek-largest-smartphone-chip-vendor-countepoint-research-233007019.html">heavyweights like MediaTek</a> that thrive on budget and mid-range hardware.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-695-5g-chip-170124266.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd3410a0-f3aa-4878-b8cb-b29957b90af8</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 17:01:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635267686</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T17:01:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec5a30d0-3675-11ec-af5f-a097eea0a8de" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ec5a30d0-3675-11ec-af5f-a097eea0a8de" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 and other low-cost chips with 5G]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 and other low-cost chips with 5G]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yubico's latest security offers USB-C and NFC authentication for $29]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After introducing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yubico-yubikey-bio-fingerprint-reader-130034276.html">$80 YubiKey Bio and $85 YubiKey C Bio</a> at the start of the month, Yubico’s latest physical security is for those who want a no-frills option.

After adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-v3-firmware-three-new-oscillators-noise-engineering-synthesizer-184459017.html">three new amazing oscillators</a> earlier this year, Arturia is bringing custom wavetables to the MicroFreak as a free firmware update.&nbsp;</p><p>The MicroFreak already had a wavetable engine built in, so this isn&#39;t a huge stretch. But being able to import your own wavetables opens up a the ability to really build your own unique sounds. There are countless sources fo free wavetables out there ranging from classic analog tones, to icy atmospheres, to blasts of noise. But you can basically use any sound file you want. Hum into your phone, or capture audio of the stray cats in your neighborhood fighting, then upload it to the MicroFreak and turn it into a synthesizer.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d5b99f66c42d47bfa918d5f9558f24cc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W70Z8AUaeFw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Adding custom wavetables is easy enough using Arturia&#39;s MIDI Control Center desktop app. There&#39;s a dedicated tab for them at the top of the interface once you connect your Microfreak. You can only have 16 custom tables at a time, and the format can be a little tricky to nail if you&#39;re concerned about perfectly smooth sounding waves — 32 cycles consisting of 256 samples per cycle. But, if you just embrace its quirks, the WaveUser engine is capable of strange, wild and abrasive sounds that speak to the MicroFreak&#39;s strengths.&nbsp;</p><p>To show off the new WaveUser engine, of course there are 64 new presets. But, let&#39;s be honest, factory presets with Arturia provided wavetables kinda defeats the whole purpose here.</p><p>The new 4.0 firmware has a few other minor improvements as well. Including a faster scrolling speed option for the oscillator controls and the ability to use Unison and Chord modes can now be applied to every note, wether they&#39;re being played live, coming from sequencer or an external source.</p><p>MicroFreak 4.0 is available as a free update now on <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/microfreak/overview">Arturia&#39;s website</a> and through MIDI Control Centre.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-custom-wavetables-micro-freak-synthesizer-4-0-update-162124618.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6d1148b-5c1c-4f16-932c-0c042030662c</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 16:21:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635265286</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T16:21:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75121450-3677-11ec-9ffb-7a14a60335be" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75121450-3677-11ec-9ffb-7a14a60335be" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MicroFreak 4.0 update]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MicroFreak 4.0 update]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['A Quiet Place' is being adapted into a video game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No one in their right mind would actually want to live in the world of <em>A Quiet Place</em>, where denizens walk around barefoot and move <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-netflix-the-silence-trailer.html"><ins>as silently as possible</ins></a> to avoid incurring the wrath of highly noise-sensitive aliens.

The nomination isn&#39;t be a surprising move given her existing title, broad <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/us/politics/jessica-rosenworcel-fcc.html?referringSource=articleShare">support</a> and alignment with White House policies on issues <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html">like net neutrality</a>, but it still represents a milestone for the agency.</p><p>Biden has also nominated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-15-fcc-net-neutrality-deadline-extended.html">Gigi Sohn</a> for an unoccupied commissioner position.

The Senate must confirm Rosenworcel to make her appointment official, and she could face staunch opposition from Republicans who are both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-net-neutrality-repeal-april-23rd-federal-register.html">historically anti-regulation</a> and eager to reclaim FCC control. The party could retake the majority in the commission if Rosenworcel and the empty commissioner position aren&#39;t confirmed by the end of 2021.</p><p>If Rosenworcel does pass the Senate, though, she would contrast sharply with the last permanent FCC chair, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ajit-pai-stepping-down-fcc-chairman-replacement-what-happens-now-153024203.html">Ajit Pai</a>. While much of Rosenworcel&#39;s work as acting chairwoman has focused on easy-to-pass rules on issues <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-911-robocall-rulemaking-215014128.html">like robocalls</a>, she has been a strong proponent of net neutrality and other efforts to keep big telecoms in check. That&#39;s largely the opposite of Pai, who dismantled neutrality and generally sided with incumbent telcos. Don&#39;t be surprised if Rosenworcel used a permanent appointment to undo more of Pai&#39;s work, at least so long as she has the votes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fcc-jessica-rosenworcel-first-female-chair-154933419.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83c8aca1-7acf-4411-9568-9ebe02bf4939</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:49:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635264288</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T16:04:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/34090980-366f-11ec-8fed-34ee7055eb29" width="4523" height="3015" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/34090980-366f-11ec-8fed-34ee7055eb29" width="4523" height="3015" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alex Wong via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - JUNE 24:  Commissioner of Federal Communications Commission Jessica Rosenworcel (L) speaks as commissioner of Federal Communications Commission Michael O’Rielly (R) listens during a hearing before Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee at Russell Senate Office Building June 24, 2020 in Washington, DC.

Sure, you could leave your PS5 on or put it in rest mode, but if there was a power outage or an overnight automatic system software update, you&#39;d lose all of your progress. Given that runs can last several hours, not having any kind of save state option wasn&#39;t great.</p><p>Housemarque, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html"><ins>now a PlayStation-owned studio</ins></a>, has finally attempted to remedy that problem in <em>Returnal&#39;s </em>2.0<em>&nbsp;</em>patch. With the Suspend Cycle option, you can pause your run, create a suspend point and close the game without worrying too much about losing progress.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3563a92e12c64b32984e698d03662d8f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmBcI_9Bui0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There are some caveats, though. You&#39;ll only be able to resume your run from any suspend point one time. So, don&#39;t expect to return to that point if (or more likely when) Selene dies. It&#39;s a smart way to introduce a save system and let players take a break without disrupting the game&#39;s start-over-when-you-die roguelite structure.</p><p>You won&#39;t be able to create a suspend point in certain scenarios either. If you&#39;re in the midst of a boss battle, intense combat sequence, cinematic or first-person section, you&#39;ll need to see it through, one way or another. &quot;We felt there are certain moments in <em>Returnal </em>that are best experienced unfragmented to preserve the intended challenge and flow,&quot; game director Harry Krueger wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/26/returnal-2-0-update-brings-suspend-cycle-and-photo-mode/"><ins>PlayStation blog post</ins></a>.</p><p>As deadly as the biomes of Atropos are, they&#39;re often gorgeous too. To help you capture the sights, another feature that <em>Returnal </em>players have been clamoring for is now in the game — Photo Mode. Other than in certain situations (such as first-person sections), you can pause the PS5 exclusive and enter Photo Mode.</p><p>You have a selection of tools at your disposal, including settings like focal distance, aperture, color gradient, saturation and contrast, as well as a way to change the scene&#39;s lighting. There are also filters, effects, frames, coloring options and other ways to jazz up your image before you capture it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sony is set to host its next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-state-of-play-ps4-ps5-date-143705569.html"><ins>State of Play stream</ins></a> on Wednesday. The showcase will run for around 20 minutes and primarily focus on third-party games, but don&#39;t be surprised if Sony sneaks a first-party game or two in there.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/returnal-ps5-save-game-suspend-cycle-photo-mode-152123500.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">423ce6fc-a05f-4e36-986c-f194124def6b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635261393</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T15:16:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f41e0a20-366c-11ec-bc3f-3e273320fe90" width="1550" height="888" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f41e0a20-366c-11ec-bc3f-3e273320fe90" width="1550" height="888" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from Returnal, in which Selene faces a creature that's firing a volley of bullets toward her.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Returnal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo’s 2022 C40 Recharge adds fastback style to the XC40]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2022 Volvo C40 Recharge is the automaker’s first EV-only vehicle.

It&#39;s <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/10/26/adobe-unleashes-content-attribution-features-photoshop-beyond-max-2021.html#gs.e3hruy">updating</a> Photoshop on the desktop with a beta Content Credentials feature that, among other upgrades, helps you establish the authenticity of your NFTs. Once artists link their crypto wallets and social media accounts to Content Credentials, buyers can check that the wallet used to produce artwork is the same wallet that minted it.</p><p>Adobe has partnered with a handful of NFT marketplaces to enable the feature, including KnownOrigin, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nft-insider-trader-resigns-190502174.html">OpenSea</a>, Rarible and SuperRare. There&#39;s no mention of whether or not other marketplaces will participate in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Content Credentials can be helpful even if you&#39;re uninterested in NFTs. An opt-in Photoshop feature attaches edits and identity info to images, adding transparency and (hopefully) quashing concerns about deception. Adobe Stock assets now include credentials, and they&#39;ll be visible in Behance. Adobe also hopes to release an open source developer kit that lets anyone fold Content Credentials into their products, expanding its use well beyond <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobes-latest-photoshop-lets-you-simply-hover-over-an-object-to-select-it-130055599.html">Creative Cloud</a> users.</p><p>There&#39;s little doubt Adobe wants to become a mainstay of the NFT world with this move. All the same, it could be genuinely important if the technology continues to grow. The value of NFT art is highly dependent on its authenticity. The Photoshop addition could help more artists &#39;stamp&#39; their projects, not to mention save time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-to-verify-nft-art-in-photoshop-145756679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04c1615b-82b6-410d-82d8-809989df2cce</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 14:57:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635260278</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T14:58:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c39e92c0-366c-11ec-bd33-5e169f127a89" width="1920" height="1315" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c39e92c0-366c-11ec-bd33-5e169f127a89" width="1920" height="1315" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Content Credentials beta in Adobe Photoshop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Content Credentials beta in Adobe Photoshop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s Clubhouse competitor may let you DJ your own radio show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/"><ins>Amazon</ins></a> is said to be working on a live audio app that sounds like it will let anyone be the DJ of their own radio show — including music.

Chief among those is the &quot;Hover Auto-masking Object Selection Tool&quot; that allows you to select a scene object simply by hovering your mouse over it.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is really as simple as that, as Adobe&#39;s Sensei AI kicks in to determine the edges of an object and select it automatically with a single click. Adobe has promised that selections made either with the hover or other object selection tools &quot;are now more accurate and preserve more details in the edges of a selection,&quot; helping users save time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7dac82f0-357b-11ec-8757-176a74ecf2b2" style="height:431;width:650;" alt="Adobe photoshop updates max 2021" data-uuid="fae08631-dfe7-3632-bff3-f052d8770654"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>The tool can detect most but not all objects in a scene, and Adobe said it&#39;s constantly improving it to include additional object categories. If an object is not detected or only partially detected, you can drag a marquee over the areas you&#39;d like to select, which is how the tool worked previously.&nbsp;</p><p>Along the same lines is another new feature called &quot;mask all objects.&quot; Also powered by Sensei AI, it simply scans the scene and automatically selects and masks every object in the scene. It can then create masks or objects without the need to do a lick of tedious masking work.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/50df4580-3578-11ec-aefb-dd53b4363a21" style="height:707;width:1432;" alt="Adobe&#39;s latest Photoshop lets you simply hover over an object to select it" data-uuid="b83256c2-7bf0-33bb-86e1-69e5e530e077"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>Last year, Adobe introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/photoshop-desktop-ipad-update-artificial-intelligence-130024695.html">Neural Filters</a> that let you do things like smooth skin or make a photo look like a Van Gogh painting. For 2021, it has introduced more of those filters in beta, most notably the Landscape Mixer, Color Transfer and Harmonization. Landscape Mixer can essentially blend multiple landscape to create a new scene with desert elements replacing a seaside coastal scene, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>The most useful one, however, sounds like Color Transfer. It lets you take the colors, contrast and other elements from a photo you like and apply it to another photo, or &quot;make this image look like that,&quot; as Adobe puts it. That would remove a lot of the tedium or trying to match a photographer&#39;s style, or at least give you a starting point toward the look you&#39;re aiming for.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c928a890-357a-11ec-9ffd-027b98e5a5e0" style="height:834;width:2000;" alt="Adobe&#39;s latest Photoshop lets you simply hover over an object to select it" data-uuid="8854cf3f-3e4a-3d11-95eb-c5c5afac9fce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>The last one, the Harmonization neural filter, makes it easier to composite two images. It overlays a foreground image onto a background, while automatically adjusting the hue and luminosity of the foreground image to match. Adobe also improved the existing neural filters, adding more realistic blurs to Depth Blur, while also improving the Superzoom, Style Transfer and Colorize filters.</p><p>Other new updates improved gradients, color management and HDR capabilities. Finally, Adobe has improved interoperability between Photoshop and Illustrator, letting you copy vector shapes from Illustrator and paste them into Photoshop, &quot;all while maintaining editable attributes in Photoshop like fill, stroke, blend mode and opacity.&quot; And when Photoshop can&#39;t maintain editability from Illustrator because it doesn&#39;t support a feature, &quot;we try to maintain visual fidelity.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobes-latest-photoshop-lets-you-simply-hover-over-an-object-to-select-it-130055599.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2531f31e-b64e-46fa-8737-c4e7567af20e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635156608</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T10:10:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1b884050-3576-11ec-9faf-b6f1e85a08a2" width="2000" height="1143" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1b884050-3576-11ec-9faf-b6f1e85a08a2" width="2000" height="1143" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe's latest Photoshop lets you simply hover over an object to select it]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe's latest Photoshop lets you simply hover over an object to select it]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe brings Photoshop and Illustrator to the web]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adobe has <a href="https://xn--mastertheblogadobe-dn9jha.hlx.page/en/drafts/jennie/creative-cloud-canvas-spaces-ps-ai-in-browser.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s taken &quot;a major step forward for collaboration&quot; by bringing its Photoshop and Illustrator apps to the web.

That&#39;s essentially a whiteboard available to project members, showing documents, images and whatever else is required.&nbsp;</p><p>You can start sharing Photoshop and Illustrator work via the web, for the purpose of commenting and feedback, simply by updating the latest versions of the apps dropping today. If you want to try the basic editing capabilities, they&#39;re available via beta for Photoshop (within the Creative Cloud app) or as a private beta for Illustrator.

Oura rings found themselves on the fingers of a number of high-profile figures and a number of studies used it to determine if wearable technology <a href="https://www.engadget.com/west-virginia-university-oura-ring-covid-19-symptoms-003239603.html">could predict COVID-19 symptom</a>s. Now, the Finnish company is announcing its third-generation ring with an even greater emphasis on cramming as much hardware into that tiny body as the laws of physics will allow.</p><p>The v3 Oura Ring doesn’t look much different compared to its predecessor, and isn’t — at least on the outside. Inside, however, the company has sweated several new components down to fit inside its chassis, including a new optical heart-rate sensor. That unit alone will let the wearable track your heart rate during the day — something it’s only been able to do at night so far. In addition, you’ll also get heart rate tracking during workouts, and even get blood oxygenation readings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With new improved continuous temperature monitoring, Oura’s makers believe that the new model will be far better at predicting when periods will begin. The company added that you can expect more accurate sleep tracking, although the insights related to that won’t be available until at some point early next year. You’ll also get data about how relaxed and rested you are to better enable you to take some time out as, and when, you need it.</p><p>You may have noticed that many wearables companies have pivoted toward getting that sweet, sweet recurring revenue in recent years. Oura is no exception, and for $5.99 a month you can get “daily health insights, personalized recommendations, exclusive audio, educational videos and more.” If you sign up for the membership, you’ll also get a discount on the price of the new ring, which will set you back $299 when it begins shipping at some point in November.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oura-third-generation-smart-ring-continuous-heart-rate-temperature-tracking-130043398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d246aa2-3c7d-47ee-aad5-ea443ce830c1</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635173757</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T14:56:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4a0f6620-35a2-11ec-94df-c23efdef9375" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4a0f6620-35a2-11ec-94df-c23efdef9375" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oura]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the third-generation Oura ring on white background with an emphasis on the new LED sensors.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oura v3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition review: The best e-reader. Period.]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One thing you can definitely say about Amazon’s Kindle: It’s not the kind of device you need to upgrade often, even if you’re an avid reader. I’ve been using the same one since late 2015, and it’s still going strong. But Amazon caught my attention with <a href="https://amzn.to/2XGjv8C">the 5th-generation Paperwhite</a>. For the first time since the original came out, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-signature-edition-130032095.html">increased the display size</a> to 6.8 inches from 6 inches, and it has narrower bezels than before. It also now uses 17 LED backlights (up from only five) and an adjustable “warm light” to reduce eye strain at night. Amazon has also finally switched to USB-C for charging.</p><p>Those are some notable new features, but Amazon is also offering a “Signature Edition” (SE) this year, which has 32GB of storage (the standard model only has 8GB), an automatically adjusting backlight, wireless charging and no ads on the lock screen. And it&#39;s still waterproof, can play Audible audiobooks over Bluetooth and has tremendous battery life. At $190, it’s not cheap; nor, at $140, is the standard Paperwhite. But, if you’ve been using yours for as long than me (or longer), there’s a lot to like here. It doesn’t radically change the Kindle experience, but does make it a lot nicer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’ve used a Kindle at all in the last decade, you’ll be familiar with the new Paperwhite’s design. Like other e-readers, the Paperwhite is dominated by an E Ink touchscreen that has gentle backlights you can turn on or off and adjust to fit your reading conditions. Like earlier Kindles, the rest of the device is soft-touch plastic that picks up fingerprint grease a little too easily.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6298f3e0-35d5-11ec-ae5f-0ec9fa182983" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="d4309305-dd5b-3067-beb8-388063920f2b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">like the 2018 Paperwhite</a>, the screen here is flush with the front of the device, rather than being slightly recessed like it was on previous models. Coming from an older device, I loved this change. It makes swiping the touchscreen to turn pages much more pleasant, and having the display a little closer to your eyes feels better, too. It’s simply a higher-quality experience – but if you have a 2018 Paperwhite, or the more expensive Kindle Oasis, you know this already.</p><p>More significant is the larger screen size. Amazon kept the same 300 pixel-per-inch density here, so the display looks as nice as ever. There’s just more room for your books and navigating the Kindle UI. Between the extra screen space and some changes to the interface, using the device is much more comfortable than it used to be. It is worth knowing that the new Paperwhite is ever so slightly wider and taller — so if you have small hands or already found the Kindle to be a little too large, this might be an issue. But, for me, the larger screen is a massive improvement, and it isn’t diminished in the least by the slightly bigger body.</p><p>The screen bezels are also significantly smaller as well. The bottom bezel is on the large side, presumably so you can rest your thumb on it while reading, but the ones on the top, left and right are all very thin. The smaller bezels, larger display and lack of a recessed screen all combine to make this hardware feel more premium than previous Kindle Paperwhite models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62999020-35d5-11ec-bfaf-ab80b3314d09" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="cd7a6054-9b0e-3540-aa46-db6a90c6348a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>A less impactful change is the new LED front lighting system. There are 17 individual LEDs that give the Paperwhite its gentle glow that lets you read in poor light, up from five that were in the previous model. That sounds like a big improvement, but I can’t say I notice a major difference. The Old Paperwhite already had a very smooth front lighting system, and it looks great on the new model, too, just not dramatically better.</p><p>These LEDs do have a new trick, though: “adjustable warm lighting.” It’s similar to the Night Shift feature Apple added to its products a few years ago; it adjusts the color temperature of the display lighting to a more amber hue. The Kindle’s blighting system never felt too blue to me, and since we’re not dealing with a glowing LCD, they’ve always been less likely to disrupt sleep. But being able to adjust the screen’s color temperature is still handy.</p><p>As with other devices, you can set two different color temperatures, one for during the day and a warmer setting for after the sun has gone down. There’s also an automatic schedule that uses location services to automatically and gradually change the color temperature based on sunrise and sunset in your current location.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/629b64e0-35d5-11ec-9ffe-a819228a7896" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="23f7d87f-234b-3ae0-abac-0244eb2813b8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>I appreciate the multiple ways you can customize the warmth of the Paperwhite’s screen, but it’s also a little confusing. When you pull down the settings shade, you’ll see sliders for both brightness and screen warmth. Then, when you dive into the section where you can set a schedule, there’s another slider to set the warmth for the scheduled time. It took me a bit to realize that one slider covered the warmth outside of the scheduled time and another was only in effect during the schedule.I eventually I got everything sorted out, though. And if you don’t care about scheduling the screen’s color temperature, you can just pick a setting that looks best to you and forget about it.</p><p>You’ve been able to set different brightness levels on the Kindle for years now, but the Paperwhite Signature Edition can automatically adjust to the ambient light. Smartphones have had this feature for years, and the more expensive Kindle Oasis has had it for a while, too. Here, it works pretty quickly and reliably. I first manually set the brightness to a comfortable level for the room I was reading in, and then put my trust in the auto brightness feature. I could definitely notice it kicking on in brighter rooms and turning things down in my dimly lit bedroom when I was getting ready to crash for the night. It’s not an essential feature, but it is nice to have.</p><p>Come to think of it, “nice to have” describes most of the difference between the standard Kindle Paperwhite and the Signature Edition. The standard version comes with 8GB of storage, versus 32GB in the SE. The SE also has wireless charging, which works quite well – I dropped the Paperwhite on a few Anker chargers I have around the house, and it charged up quickly and reliably. But given how long the device’s battery lasts, most people will be fine charging it with any old USB-C cable once a month or so. (I haven’t mentioned it yet, but the Paperwhite has a battery that lasts weeks, just like all the other Kindles.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62991af0-35d5-11ec-b1f0-b65b124de4d2" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="11af0585-90a5-39a8-91e2-4424c0426b16"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The SE also has an ad-free lock screen. The fact that Amazon has long charged a premium to get a device without ads on it that try to sell you more stuff from Amazon is about the most Amazon thing ever. And my desire to not have ads shoved in my face makes the Signature Edition pretty appealing. A $50 price difference is significant – but given the fact that I generally use a Kindle for five years or more, why not get rid of those ads and get a few extra features while I’m at it? Given that the standard Paperwhite without ads is only $30 cheaper than the Signature Edition, this is an upsell that I’d probably go for.</p><p>Things like storage capacity, the number of LEDs, wireless charging and so on only really matter in service of one thing: reading. Fortunately, the new Kindle Paperwhite is the best e-reader I’ve ever used. I’ve never had a big issue with how E Ink screens need to refresh when you turn the page, but the Paperwhite refreshes so quickly and smoothly that this device feels more pleasant to use than my 2015 model.</p><p>Beyond the refresh rate, the touchscreen is extremely responsive; I rarely had my taps or swipes go unrecognized. When I use the keyboard to search for books, I just plow ahead and don’t get caught up waiting for a key press to register. There are still times where you need to wait for the screen to catch up, though. That’s mostly when you’re navigating more complex layouts, like the Kindle Store.</p><p>In some regards, the new Kindle Paperwhite changes nothing; Amazon has had a stranglehold on the e-reader market for years, and the previous Paperwhite was the device to get. The new Paperwhite is still Amazon’s best e-reader. It’s not as expensive and fancy as the Kindle Oasis, but it offers a far better experience than the basic $90 Kindle. The bigger screen and higher resolution are reasons enough to choose the Paperwhite if you’re anything more than the most casual of readers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/629aa190-35d5-11ec-9fbf-fa7633b0c4eb" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="1e8592e4-2bf9-353d-a94b-6f43607cd70f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The other question is whether the $190 “Signature Edition” is worth the $50 premium over the standard model. For most people, the answer is probably no. The two devices are essentially the same in every significant way. Wireless charging is a bonus, but given how infrequently the Paperwhite needs to be charged, it’s not a huge upgrade in convenience. More storage is never a bad thing, but 8GB can still hold literally thousands of books. The extra space is really only important if you use Audible on the Kindle, because audiobooks can quickly eat through your storage.</p><p>The auto-adjusting light is probably my favorite of these Signature Edition features. Almost every other display in your life can do that, And having it here makes sense, especially if you power up your Paperwhite in the middle of the night. Plus, it’s hard to overstate what a relief it is to not have to see an ad every time you pick up the device.</p><p>Ultimately, if I were <a href="https://amzn.to/2XGjv8C">buying the Kindle Paperwhite</a> for someone as a gift, I’d probably get the standard edition. If I was buying for myself, I’d get the Signature. But either way, I’d be buying a Kindle Paperwhite. It remains the best e-reader on the market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98cd2edf-8342-44f4-bea5-c6cdc981fcc6</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635256213</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T13:50:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/629b3dd0-35d5-11ec-9ffb-68a8f5cf7272" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/629b3dd0-35d5-11ec-9ffb-68a8f5cf7272" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Kindle Paperwhite Special Edition (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe adds automatic sky and subject masking to Lightroom]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At its annual Max conference, Adobe detailed some enhancements that are coming to its <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/10/26/max-2021-photography-releases.html"><ins>Lightroom and Lightroom Classic software suites</ins></a>. To start, the company is introducing a “re-envisioned” set of selective adjustment tools. Set to make their way to all devices where you can access Lightroom and Lightroom Classic, the tools are accessible via a newly added masking button. Much like you can do in Photoshop, they allow you to create multiple masks, including color and luminance ones. In turn, those will allow you to make precise adjustments to specific parts of a photo.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d86594c0-35a3-11ec-b91a-256a0a037adb" style="height:1874;width:2560;" alt="Adobe masking" data-uuid="d7a7168a-055e-30a7-b458-80cbb1490e31"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>Of course, individually masking elements of an image can be time-consuming, and so Adobe is also introducing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-camera-raw-lightroom-classic-mask-features-ai-160056644.html"><ins>AI-powered tool</ins></a> that can automatically detect the select the subject and sky in your photos. In addition to rolling out to Lightroom Classic and Lightroom on Mac and PC, this is coming to select Android and iOS devices. And that’s where Adobe envisions it being the most useful since it should help with editing on a smaller screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you like to start your edits with a preset, a new recommendation engine in Lightroom for Mac, Windows and mobile will suggest ones based on the subject of your photos. The presets will come from the Lightroom community, so you can expect to find “hundreds of thousands,” according to the company. Additionally, Adobe is introducing eight new premium presets, adding to the seven it released previously. Those are available to use in all versions of Lightroom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ea094460-35a3-11ec-9968-371048b81d9c" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Adobe recommended presets" data-uuid="958514bb-6a75-327f-b861-1bf91f654df8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>To make cropping easier on Lightroom for Mac and Windows, Adobe has added the option to select a variety of overlays for different aspect ratios. Some of the options on this front include thirds, golden ratio and diagonal.</p><p>Lastly, the company is introducing a new feature in Lightroom for Mac and Windows called Community Remix. It allows you to upload a photo edit and invite other photographers to take it in a different direction. Adobe says it plans to bring Community Remix to other versions of Lightroom in the future.</p><p>Adobe says it will begin rolling out all of the above updates starting today.

Last fall, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-fresco-drawing-painting-app-iphone-130042001.html">expanded the app to iPhone</a>, but this year the updates are much more robust. With the additions <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/10/26/free-drawing-painting-app-adobe-fresco-adds-motion-tools-more-for-adobe-max-2021.html">announced today</a> at its annual Adobe Max design conference, the company gives its free-to-use drawing and painting app handy tools that expand how and what artists are able to create.&nbsp;</p><p>First, Adobe is adding motion to Fresco. This gives artists and designers the option to add timelines and motion frames to individual layers. The company explains that this allows you to assign specific movement to each element. Adobe says you can also draw paths for objects to follow and the goal is to keep things simple so the concept of motion is approachable for all skill levels.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Next, the company is adding reference layers to Fresco. This should help speed up the process when you need to add color to line art. Once you set the reference layer, you can begin working on a separate layer for fills. Fresco will still recognize the lines on the original layer without applying edits to it. This will work if your reference layer is vector or pixels and keeps your original drawing intact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5f1e33c0-35cf-11ec-8fdd-39b5b20c6766" style="height:1118;width:1600;" alt="Adobe Fresco" data-uuid="3abc1e1b-a380-3cb7-9106-8a8428c25170"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe/Kyle Webster</div></figure><p>Vector brushes are already available in Fresco, but Adobe is expanding that library to include a new set with &quot;jitter.&quot; Basically, these brushes will help you quickly give drawings texture. Lines are still sharp, but there&#39;s variation in the stroke for a more naturally drawn look. As always, vector brushes are infinitely scalable and can be combined with pixel brushes in the same Fresco file.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, Adobe is helping you keep your perspective correct with new guides. Perspective grids will help you keep illustrations looking realistic when it&#39;s time to add depth. You can set vanishing points anywhere, even off the the artboard, and lines will snap to the grids as you work. Adobe says this should allow artists and designers to focus more on art and less on the heavy lifting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Adobe Fresco is free for anyone to use on iPhone, iPad and Windows without a Creative Cloud subscription. There are more tools available if you do pay for Adobe&#39;s apps, like access to an expanded library of brushes.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-fresco-update-fall-2021-130004402.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c90957f-0fa6-4f76-8ba1-7cef6bab94c6</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635193519</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T20:25:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/121fe9b0-35ca-11ec-bfbd-7e02bdd0579a" width="1600" height="1147" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/121fe9b0-35ca-11ec-bfbd-7e02bdd0579a" width="1600" height="1147" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe/Bejamin Kohl]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe Fresco]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Fresco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Master & Dynamic put its headphone expertise into a $450 gaming headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Master &amp; Dynamic" href="https://fave.co/3ekiqIb">Master &amp; Dynamic</a> has staked its name on its mix of refined design, premium materials and crisp, clear audio quality. The company has a number of models under its belt, including wired, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-master-and-dynamic-mh40-wireless-headphones-announced.html">wireless</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-master-and-dynamic-mw65-review.html">noise-cancelling headphones</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">true wireless earbuds</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-18-master-and-dynamic-ma770-wireless-speaker-concrete.html">a concrete speaker</a>. Now M&amp;D is venturing into uncharted sonic territory: gaming headsets. With the MG20, the company has built a set of &quot;wireless gaming headphones&quot; with its trademark design and a range of handy features for a whopping $449 (€449/£429).&nbsp;</p><p>The MG20 has a familiar look to the company&#39;s over-ear headphones, with some simplified design choices. This gaming headset doesn&#39;t have quite as many varying textures as some of M&amp;D&#39;s other products, for example. This time around, the company opted for a combo of aluminum, magnesium, lambskin leather and Alcantara. There&#39;s a detachable boom mic for gaming sessions and the MG20 also has microphones for calls when you&#39;re using them as a set of headphones. The headphones also have a semi-open back design for a wider sound stage and more natural audio quality.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, 50mm drivers power 7.1 surround sound with support for aptX HD for music and aptX Low-Latency for mobile gaming. With the debut of the MG20, M&amp;D has added EQ presets to it&#39;s headphone app for the first time, allowing users to select a sound profile to fit their needs. What&#39;s more, independent volume controls for game audio offer another degree of customization. A low-latency USB adapter is compatible with both PlayStation and PC and offers easy switching between devices. Master &amp; Dynamic says the MG20 will last for up to 22 hours on a charge, and thanks to wear detection, the headphones can save battery life when you&#39;re not wearing them.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MG20" href="https://fave.co/3ekiqIb">MG20</a> will be available in black and white color options starting November 16th.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="ed2e1dfe-3c69-47ed-a716-6a71de4ce932"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mg20-gaming-headset-announce-specs-price-120045652.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">889a1692-4d29-4a5c-9ca8-54fcb15834b5</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 12:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635250413</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T12:13:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc2a3ce0-35fc-11ec-bf77-ceb2d4f72363" width="1600" height="908" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc2a3ce0-35fc-11ec-bf77-ceb2d4f72363" width="1600" height="908" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Master & Dynamic MG20]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Master & Dynamic MG20]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Palm pivots to audio with $129 ANC true wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years after releasing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-palm-is-back-hands-on.html">a teensy phone</a> designed to act as a companion for your primary device, the latest incarnation of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/palm/">Palm</a> is back with a new product: a set of true wireless earbuds.

Buds Pro has active noise cancellation, bass-heavy audio with 10mm dynamic drivers and an array of six microphones that can tamp down background noise on calls. When the passthrough Ambient Mode is enabled, you&#39;ll be able to hear both audio playback and sounds from the world around you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/52c33660-3378-11ec-bdcf-fe821ec27a20" alt="An image showing the three microphones in each Palm Buds Pro earbud." data-uuid="83f9ee80-2054-3a93-826f-8c936cd242f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Palm</div></figure><p>The battery will run for up to 5.5 hours or, if ANC is enabled, 4.5 hours, Palm says. The earbuds should be good for three hours of talk time. The charging case has a 400 mAh battery, which should provide the earbuds with over 24 hours of playback time before you have to recharge the case, according to Palm.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also fast pairing and syncing with devices, IPX4 sweat and water resistance and support for Siri and Google Assistant. In addition, the earbuds come with three sets of tips to help you find the best fit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5599d600-3378-11ec-affe-3e4a4c59c70a" alt="A person wearing a Palm Buds Pro earbud." data-uuid="d1daae66-cef7-33d3-bb18-8a5eaecd887f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Palm</div></figure><p>Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the Palm Buds Pro at the outset is how much they cost. The earbuds will be $129 at retail, which is a solid price for a set of ANC earbuds. If you pre-order by November 9th (when general availability starts), you can get a $30 discount.&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-orders are now open in the US, Canada and Mexico <a href="https://palm.com/">on Palm&#39;s website</a>. Palm will ship the earbuds internationally to select markets. There&#39;s also a silicone case accessory in Shadow Black, Rose Pink and Navy Blue. The case is $15 during the pre-order period. It&#39;ll typically cost $25.</p><p>It remains to be seen how good Palm Buds Pro are in practice. Even though we weren&#39;t huge fans of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-21-palm-phone-review.html">the Palm Phone</a>, there&#39;s a strong design pedigree behind the earbuds, so they might very well be worth checking out.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/palm-buds-pro-anc-true-wireless-earbuds-120015174.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0aacb773-a605-42f0-be7a-6774396286dd</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 12:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635265540</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T16:25:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d8594b0-3679-11ec-befd-87534e5e8cf9" width="3500" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d8594b0-3679-11ec-befd-87534e5e8cf9" width="3500" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Palm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The new Palm-branded Buds Pro earbuds shown in three colors against a black background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Palm Buds Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Sony’s Xperia Pro-1 is a camera first, smartphone second]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony’s smartphones have never quite set the world on fire.

The device can capture RAW stills, 4K 120 fps video, and (like the last few Xperia 1 models) shoot images at 20 fps as well.</p><p>Also notably, there’s a 24mm lens made from glass that can switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0 apertures — another rare feature, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-08-samsung-galaxy-s9-and-s9-plus-review-video.html">if not the first phone to feature aperture switching.</a></p><p>The phone will also arrive with all kinds of dongles and add-ons, including support for Sony’s “dead-cat” muffler to cut wind noise, a shooting grip and its very own add-on display, for self-recording and vlogging with the primary camera sensor.</p><p>As tradition dictates, Sony is demanding a premium, yet again.

Both US retail giants have stopped selling products from Lorex and Ezviz, while Lowe&#39;s no longer carries products by the former. Lorex is a subsidiary of Dahua Technology, whereas Ezviz is a surveillance tech brand owned by Hikvision. As <em>TechCrunch</em> explains, the US government added Dahua and Hikvision to its economic blacklist in 2019 for their role in the <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/">mass surveillance</a> of Uighur Muslims in the province of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread.html">Xinjiang</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-02-09/dahua-facial-recognition-china-surveillance-uighur"><em>Los Angeles Times</em></a> published a report detailing how the facial recognition software developed by Lorex owner Dahua was being shopped to law enforcement as a way to identify Uyghurs. A user guide for the service apparently touts its capability to identify people passing in front of its cameras by race. Meanwhile, Hikvision&#39;s cameras have been installed at mosques and detention camps in Xinjiang, according to a 2019<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/world/asia/china-surveillance-xinjiang.html"><em> New York Times</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>report. Maya Wang, a China researcher for Human Rights Watch, told the publication back then: &quot;These systems are designed for a very explicit purpose — to target Muslims.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a <a href="https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/china/">report</a> on the human rights practices in China, the US Department of State said that the Chinese government &quot;conducted mass arbitrary detention of Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim and ethnic minority groups in Xinjiang. China Human Rights Defenders alleged these detentions amounted to enforced disappearance, since families were often not provided information about the length or location of the detention.&quot; Human rights groups believe over a million Uyghurs are being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037">detained</a> in internment camps, but China continues to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/china-denies-uighur-abuse-claims-as-international-pressure-grows">deny</a> the allegations.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s unclear why the retail giants have decided to pull Lorex and Ezviz products now, but consumers have freely been able to buy their security cameras over the past couple of years after their parent companies were placed in the US economic blacklist. Home Depot told <em>TechCrunch</em> that it&#39;s &quot;committed to upholding the highest standards of ethical sourcing and [it] immediately stopped selling products from Lorex when this was brought to [the company&#39;s] attention.&quot; Best Buy simply told the publication that it was “discontinuing its relationship&quot; with both Lorex and Ezviz.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-retailers-stop-selling-security-cameras-lorex-ezviz-082543444.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75bcbef3-ed83-4d49-9081-9c1a81a222a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 08:25:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635268484</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T17:14:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Human Rights]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0f05fde0-362a-11ec-b27b-1fd8c31db195" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0f05fde0-362a-11ec-b27b-1fd8c31db195" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lorex]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lorex]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lorex]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Insider update offers easier Twitch streaming on Xbox consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Streaming to Twitch on the PS5 is relatively easy, but not so much on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Xbox Series X</a> or S — you currently need to download the Twitch app and run through a series of steps.

It was a phone the company made for video professionals. Now, Sony is back with a second professional-grade smartphone designed to appeal to photography enthusiasts. The headline feature of the Xperia Pro-I is a 1-inch sensor borrowed from the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-sonys-mic-ready-rx100-vii-is-a-vloggers-dream.html">RX100 VII</a> point-and-shoot camera. That&#39;s a much larger sensor than you&#39;ll find on most phones.&nbsp;</p><p>To put things in perspective, the primary sensor on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel 6 Pro</a> features a pixel pitch of 1.2µm. By contrast, the main sensor on the Pro-I has 2.4µm-sized pixels, making it much better in low light. It can also shoot 12-bit RAW files and native 4K video at 120 frames per second with eye-detection auto-focus. Speaking of auto-focus, it comes with 315 points that cover 90 percent of the frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pro-I also includes one of Sony&#39;s BIONZ X imaging processors, giving it the ability to shoot up to 20 frames per second with both auto-focus and auto-exposure enabled.  The fast readout speed of the sensor allows it to avoid a rolling shutter effect, a feature Sony says helps the Pro-I stand out from other phones with 1-inch sensors like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-price-launch-date-134516642.html">Mi 11 Ultra</a>. Those handsets also don&#39;t have phase-detection autofocus like the Pro-I does.</p><p>Complimenting the 1-inch sensor is a 24mm lens made from glass that can switch between f/2.0 and f/4.0 apertures. Sony went with an aspherical design to make the optics as small as possible. Flanking the primary camera is a 16mm ultrawide camera and a 50mm telephoto camera. Sony says it chose that lens arrangement after consulting with photographers who told the company they wanted a setup that matched their collection of prime lenses.</p><p>Once you get past its camera, the Xperia Pro-I is essentially a souped-up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii-pro-camera-smartphones-5g-specs-074022474.html">Xperia 1 III</a>. Internally, the phone features a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888</a> supported by 12GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage. You can add up to 1TB of additional storage with the help of a microSD card. Powering everything is a 4,500mAh battery Sony claims will allow you to use the Pro-I for a full day on a single charge. Inside the box is a 30W power adapter that can charge the phone to 50 percent in 30 minutes.</p><p>The Pro-I also features the same 6.5-inch OLED that came on the Xperia 1 III. It&#39;s a 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. On the audio front, the Pro-I not only comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, but it also includes Sony&#39;s LDAC and DSEE technologies.</p><p>All of those capabilities come with a hefty price tag. In the US, Sony plans to sell the Xperia Pro-I for the eye-watering price of $1,800. The way the company sees it, you&#39;re effectively getting a flagship phone and RX100 VII for less than the price of buying those devices separately. However, the Xperia Pro-I isn&#39;t a one-to-one replacement for the RX100 VII. Sony&#39;s point-and-camera outputs images at 20.1-megapixel, using the full readout from its sensor. The Pro-I uses a crop because taking advantage of the entire sensor would necessitate a much larger lens than would be feasible to include on a smartphone.&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-orders for the Xperia Pro-I open on October 28th, with general availability to follow in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-announcement-031222484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">14d89184-3182-40b0-b597-a10a64b64998</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 03:12:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635217988</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T03:13:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c67fd50-360a-11ec-b0ff-e4ea7d85e62e" width="1600" height="961" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c67fd50-360a-11ec-b0ff-e4ea7d85e62e" width="1600" height="961" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Xperia Pro-I]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony  Xperia Pro-I]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook's future is 'young adults' and the metaverse]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amid reports that Facebook <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline?sref=10lNAhZ9">has misled</a> shareholders about significant <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks">declines</a> in teens and younger users, Mark Zuckerberg said the company was “retooling” in order to make “serving young adults” its top priority. To do that, the company plans to make “significant changes” to its Facebook and Instagram apps, and spend billions of dollars building out its vision for a “metaverse.”</p><p>Citing increased competition from TikTok and iMessage, Zuckerberg said the company would do more to win over “young adult” users between the ages of 18 to 29, even if it came at the expense of older users. Speaking during the company&#39;s third-quarter earnings call, he said the company’s TikTok rival Reels would be “as important for our products as Stories.” “We also expect to make significant changes to Instagram and Facebook in the next year to further lean into video and make Reels a more central part of the experience,” Zuckerberg said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, he said the company was “retooling” internally in order to make young people its “North Star.” He added the shift “will take years, not months.” The issue of younger users has been particularly fraught for the company. A whistleblower’s disclosures about Facebook’s internal research on teen mental health prompted a series of Congressional hearings about child safety, and a wave of headlines about how the photo sharing app may be harmful to some of its most vulnerable users. At the same time, other internal documents have indicated Facebook and Instagram have faced significant declines in engagement among teens and young adults for years.</p><p>Zuckerberg said another major priority for the company would be building its vision for a “metaverse.” He didn’t comment on reports that the company would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">change its name</a> to reflect its new focus on augmented reality and virtual reality, but made clear the company has significant ambitions in the space. “Our goal is to help the metaverse reach a billion people,” he said. He added that a metaverse could enable “hundreds of billions of dollars of digital commerce.”</p><p>The company also said Monday that going forward it will report two sets of financials: one for its “family” of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp; and one for its Reality Labs division that oversees its augmented and virtual reality work. In <a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/Facebook-Reports-Third-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx">a statement</a>, Facebook said its 2021 profit will be reduced by $10 billion due to its investment in Reality Labs, and that the company would only increase its AR and VR spending in the next “several years.”</p><p>Zuckerberg also addressed the ongoing revelations stemming from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html">&quot;Facebook Papers,&quot;</a> a series of articles based on documents provided by former employee turned whistleblower <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">Frances Haugen</a>. The CEO referred to the work from a consortium of news organizations as &quot;a coordinated effort to selectively use leaked documents to paint a false picture of our company.&quot; The documents, which have been the basis of more than a dozen stories detailing Facebook&#39;s botched efforts to fight hate speech and other harms, have also been provided to members of Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Any honest account should be clear that these issues aren&#39;t primarily about social media,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;That means that no matter what Facebook does, we&#39;re never going to solve them on our own.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b96a438-3812-49d4-951a-74c93a2b1b57</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 22:07:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635201160</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T22:32:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59c6ad30-16e4-11ec-95cd-bc79f50b8032" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59c6ad30-16e4-11ec-95cd-bc79f50b8032" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GLENN CHAPMAN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook co-founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, speaks at an Oculus developers conference while wearing a virtual reality headset in San Jose, California on October 6, 2016.

Today, the spaceflight company owned by Jeff Bezos announced that it is working on creating its very own space station as well. Called <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/orbital-reef-commercial-space-station">Orbital Reef</a>, it promises to be something of an industrial and commercial hub, and is meant to start operating in the second half of this decade.&nbsp;</p><p>It will be developed, owned and operated in partnership with Sierra Space, a subsidiary of the Sierra Nevada corporation. Sierra Space is perhaps better known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-29-sierra-nevada-un-first-space-mission.html">Dream Chaser</a>, a spacecraft that’s set to begin operating in 2022 and carry cargo to the International Space Station. Orbital Reef is also backed by Boeing, Redwire Space, Genesis Engineering Solutions and Arizona State University. The company hopes to use Boeing’s Starliner and Sierra Space’s aforementioned Dream Chaser to ferry both cargo and passengers to Orbital Reef.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Think of Orbital Reef as essentially a “business park,” but in space. In a press release, Blue Origin said that the destination “will offer research, industrial, international, and commercial customers the cost competitive end-to-end services they need including space transportation and logistics, space habitation, equipment accommodation, and operations including onboard crew.” Anyone who wants to “establish their own address in orbit” can do so.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a7b9eb30-35cd-11ec-b384-5d62cac7d874" alt="Concept images of Orbital Reef. " data-uuid="4f26e64e-f1fd-3080-86a9-752cded18dd1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Blue Origin</div></figure><p>Blue Origin said that Orbital Reef would be habitable for up to 10 people, which is almost as much as that of the International Space Station. It will feature “human-centered space architecture” with “world-class services and amenities.” There will be multiple ports for visiting spacecraft and modules. Orbital Reef will apparently feature an open system that will enable any customer or nation to use it. As the market for such facilities grows, Blue Origin promises that Orbital Reef will scale the amenities and utilities to match.</p><p>“Seasoned space agencies, high-tech consortia, sovereign nations without space programs, media and travel companies, funded entrepreneurs and sponsored inventors, and future-minded investors all have a place on Orbital Reef,” said the company in a press release.</p><p>“For over sixty years, NASA and other space agencies have developed orbital space flight and space habitation, setting us up for commercial business to take off in this decade,” said Brent Sherwood, Senior Vice President of Advanced Development Programs for Blue Origin. “We will expand access, lower the cost, and provide all the services and amenities needed to normalize space flight. A vibrant business ecosystem will grow in low Earth orbit, generating new discoveries, new products, new entertainments, and global awareness.”</p><p>Blue Origin’s only successful project is a suborbital tourist program that sends passengers to the edge of space (and back) on the New Shepard. It has already flown eight people, which includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">Bezos</a> as well as Star Trek’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/william-shatner-blue-origin-spaceflight-new-shepard-144025171.html">William Shatner</a>. Other projects, such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-approves-blue-origin-for-future-uncrewed-missions-105530293.html">New Glenn rocket</a> (which the company hopes to use to launch some of Orbital Reef’s modules) and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-blue-origin-blue-moon-lunar-lander.html">Blue Moon lunar lander</a> are still in development.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/orbital-reef-200848765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7ca5a4a0-4e58-473a-849a-da11ab33ac10</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 20:08:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635196141</ingested><modified>2021-10-25T21:09:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/197441e0-35cd-11ec-b7cb-b3d9877b4250" width="2748" height="1672" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/197441e0-35cd-11ec-b7cb-b3d9877b4250" width="2748" height="1672" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Orbital Reef]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Orbital Reef]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
