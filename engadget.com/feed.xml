The big change over the last model is the addition of a handle with four stainless steel electrodes that allows it to measure ECG, segmented body composition (fat/water in your arms, legs and torso) and even esoteric things like nerve activity. All of these features will also make it one of the most expensive scales yet when it arrives to market.&nbsp;</p><p>Withings says it&#39;s the number one US smart scale manufacturer and created the Body Scan &quot;because users are demanding more and more medical and health data and information,&quot; Withings CEO Mathieu Letombe told Engadget in French.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f7ee360-6c6d-11ec-87d7-9b16c1c5b796" alt="Withings Body Scan scale" data-uuid="9dd382ce-e4cb-31c6-aa7b-bf67d934c2ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>The new scale is certainly designed to deliver that. Though the design and high-strength tempered glass construction are similar to the previous Body Cardio, it&#39;s loaded with extra sensors that can tell you more than ever about your body. That includes four weight sensors, 14 ITO (Indium tin oxide) electrodes within the platform and four stainless steel electrodes on the new handle. The battery can now go for a year between charges compared to nine months before and it packs a larger, higher-resolution 3.2-inch LCD color display.</p><p>The handle allows safe, low-level electrical signals to pass through your entire body, not just your feet — much as you may have seen on some <a href="https://tanita.eu/rd-545-hr/">advanced gym scales</a>.  To start with, that enables a new 6-lead ECG that can detect heart arrhythmias via two sets of electrodes on each side of the handle and one within the base of the sale. That compares to a single lead on smartwatches, so the Body Scan can deliver more specific results &quot;that can easily be ready by a cardiologist,&quot; said Letombe.&nbsp;</p><p>An embedded algorithm can detect heart patterns associated with atrial fibrillation, showing the results on the display or Withings&#39; Health Mate app. Those can be stored to show trends or &quot;shared with medical professionals from the app,&quot; according to Withings. &quot;Each time you weigh yourself, the scale can deliver that information, thanks to the new handle.&quot;&nbsp;</p><section data-eng-breakout="d559f4121dfb464da5d6712175dbeb58" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c86a37e0-6c5f-11ec-8ffa-f89ae9fdc719" alt="Withings Body Scan can also record your ECG and assess nerve activity"></section><p>In terms of your weight, Withings claims the Body Scan is accurate to within 0.1 pounds (50 grams) or double the previous model, but that&#39;s just the start of showing your body makeup. It uses multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure whole-body fat and water percentage, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass and extracellular and intracellular water. It can even provide readings for individual body parts, including your torso, arms and legs. All of that allows you to spot things used by health experts and sports professionals like dangerous localized fat or muscle imbalance, Withings said.&nbsp;</p><p>Working with a French company called Impeto Medical, Withings also developed a feature to assess nerve activity. It can track sweat gland activity in the feet (sudomotor function) using a small direct current via the electrodes located in the plate. Impaired function in that regard could show signs of degeneration of small nerve fibers, something that can be corrected with regular activity and a healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a useful function, because there are a lot of chronic health issues like obesity associated with poor nerve function,&quot; Letombe told me. &quot;Impeto creates devices used by neurologists and others doctors that can cost upwards of 10,000 euros, and the Body Scan is a consumer product that, again, does that every time you weigh yourself.&quot; At the same time, Withings will be able to collect nerve activity data from millions of users that could be useful for medical research and patient care.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b3bb3fe0-6c66-11ec-beff-2b499c4f7182" alt="Withings&#39; Body Scan scale has a handle that can measure fat in different parts of your body" data-uuid="56fa5485-428c-3da1-969b-76572f52c5c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Along with the scale, Withings is also introducing (yep) a subscription service, with the price yet to be announced. It will &quot;allow users to connect with medical specialists for advice and consultation while providing clinical teams with data in real-time,&quot; Withings said. It&#39;ll also offer personalized health plans, videos and more covering topics like nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management to help users with their health goals.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Body Scan, Withings will be offering consumers one of the more advanced health, sports and medical home devices out there — at a price. It&#39;s expected to cost $300 when it arrives to the US and Europe in the second half of 2022 following FDA clearance, or $100 more than the Body Scan&#39;s launch price. That will include three free months of the subscription service, but it&#39;s still big chunk of change for a scale.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot will depend on whether it delivers on all the promised features with reasonable accuracy and if it receives its FDA clearance in a timely manner. That&#39;s not necessarily a given, as it took Withings well over a year to get its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-hybrid-scan-watch-is-set-to-arrive-in-the-us-next-month-135842112.html">ScanWatch cleared</a> by the FDA after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-hands-on-ifa-2020-070001875.html">first released</a>. The company also had issues with its Pulse Wave Velocity (PVW) heart health feature, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-18-withings-restores-pulse-wave-velocity-eu.html">pulled it</a> in some regions over regulatory concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all that, it&#39;s fairly bold on Withings&#39; part to introduce a scale with even more advanced medical and health functionality. &quot;We think that&#39;s how we can advance a user&#39;s health, not by asking an extra effort, but delivering more targeted information on a product they use every day,&quot; said Letombe.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/withings-latest-scale-has-a-handheld-lead-to-measure-fat-in-different-body-parts-010059582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3261398-60ac-4b7b-a5d1-50b7bc062fe6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 01:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221524</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:52:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b15b9b10-6c10-11ec-aeef-af44dad92c2c" width="2000" height="1393" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b15b9b10-6c10-11ec-aeef-af44dad92c2c" width="2000" height="1393" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Withings' latest scale has a handheld lead to measure fat in different body parts]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Withings' latest scale has a handheld lead to measure fat in different body parts]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Moen's latest faucet can be controlled entirely with gestures]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/moen/"><ins>Moen</ins></a> has pulled back the curtain on its latest faucet, and it&#39;s one that you can control without touching at all.

This year, the major talking point is likely to be the new Nighthawk RAXE300, which sits a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nighthawk-raxe500-170003612.html">little below the flagship RAXE500</a> in the company’s high-end line. The RAXE300 offers a combined top WiFi speed of 7.8Gbps, plus the benefit of being able to leverage the 6GHz band for faster connectivity. Netgear promises that you’ll get around 2,500 square feet of coverage from the device, plus enough gigabit ethernet ports to connect the rest of your smart home to.</p><p>At the same time, Netgear wanted to take the opportunity to remind the world of the <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/mesh/nbk752/">Orbi 5G WiFi 6 Mesh NBK752</a>, which was released late last year. It’s the first 5G tri-band mesh system, which can leverage the 5G modem inside for always-on mobile broadband or as a backup should a standard wired connection fail. Not to mention that, as like many of Netgear’s tri-band products, the backhaul network between the router and its satellite(s) should ensure a stronger, more reliable connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rounding out the list is the Orbi Pro, SXK50, the company’s new mid-range device for small businesses and professional types working from home. It’s a little behind the top-tier SK80, with a cap of 75 concurrent devices, down from 100 for the flagship, as well as a slightly slower WiFi 6 speed, but it’s likely to be an ideal option for some businesses looking for faster and more reliable connectivity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5ea6a530-6cb6-11ec-8e7f-92114fa2c34c" style="height:844;width:1501;" alt="Promotional image for Netgear&#39;s new Game Booster add-on" data-uuid="6d8a8fba-dee2-30e8-9ef0-817d2bb54592"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netgear</div></figure><p>Rounding out the announcements for this year is Game Booster, a paid-for add-on service for Orbi users so that they cam get the same <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nitehawk-pro-gaming-xr1000-123031339.html">lag-banishing features found in the Nighthawk routers</a>. That includes the ability to track pings and pick the fastest server for specific online games, as well as a built-in ad-and-tracking blocker. Unfortunately, such features will set you back $50 per year after a 30-day free trial, and only if you currently own the Orbi series 750, 850 and 960.</p><p>The Netgear Nighthawk RAXE300 will be available in the first quarter of 2022, and will set you back $400, while the Orbi 5G is already available, priced at $1,099.99. The Orbi Pro SXK50, meanwhile, will be available in the US at some point in January 2022, and can be pre-ordered now for $450.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nighthawk-300-ces-2022-010041387.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6a397519-7d7e-423d-8717-0402d35acd3e</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 01:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238219</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:33:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4d117480-6cb6-11ec-afdb-793409bb74da" width="1498" height="844" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4d117480-6cb6-11ec-afdb-793409bb74da" width="1498" height="844" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netgear]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netgear Router]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netgear Router]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Y-Brush shows off a concept for its second-generation, uh, Y-shaped toothbrush]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been the better part of two years since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-ybrush-10-second-electric-toothbrush-final.html">Y-Brush started shipping</a>, offering people a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1283858434/y-brush-the-10-second-deep-cleaning-toothbrush/">different way</a> to clean their teeth. The retainer-shaped device is filled with nylon bristles which you put into your mouth, promising to sanitize your chompers in just 10 seconds.

Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing startup. The verdict comes after a months-long trial, and more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-15-elizabeth-holmes-steps-down-ceo-theranos.html"><ins>three years</ins></a> after she was first charged and forced to step down as CEO in 2018.</p><p>Of the 11 total charges, Holmes was found guilty on four: conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against individual investors. She was found not guilty on four additional charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud patients, two counts of fraud against investors, and one count of wire fraud stemming from ads Theranos ran in Arizona. The jury was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elizabeth-holmes-jury-deadlocked-3-charges-judge-sends-back-deliberate-rcna10770">deadlocked</a> on three other counts of wire fraud and returned no verdict on those charges.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>During the trial, Holmes’ lawyers tried to portray her as a young and inexperienced entrepreneur. “Elizabeth Holmes worked herself to the bone for 15 years trying to make lab testing more affordable,” one of Holmes’ attorneys said in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-holmes-case-opening-arguments-121138767.html"><ins>opening arguments</ins></a>. “She failed … but failure is not a crime.”</p><p>Holmes, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html"><ins>testified</ins></a> during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” As <em>The New York Times </em>pointed out, she “spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company’s shortcomings.”</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Holmes knew about serious flaws in the company’s technology and hid the issues from investors. Former patients who had received inaccurate blood tests also testified, including an Arizona woman who received an incorrect result for an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/theranos-patient-says-blood-test-came-back-with-false-positive-for-hiv.html"><ins>HIV test</ins></a>, and a woman who was misdiagnosed with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html"><ins>a miscarriage</ins></a>.</p><p>Holmes’ story has been a source of widespread fascination even for those outside of Silicon Valley. At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, and had a board of directors filled with former high-ranking <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-former-board-members-henry-kissinger-george-shultz-james-mattis-2019-3"><ins>government officials</ins></a>, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Holmes, who had dropped out of Stanford to start the company, regularly appeared on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/11620036/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmess-five-best-cover-story-appearances"><ins>magazine covers</ins></a> and was often compared to Steve Jobs and other iconic founders. (Holmes herself was reportedly infatuated with Jobs and adopted his signature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/fashion/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-theranos.html"><ins>black turtlenecks</ins></a>.)</p><p>Former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter John Carreyrou was the first to report on issues with Theranos’ technology in 2015, and his coverage prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits that ultimately resulted in criminal charges for Holmes and former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. On the stand, Holmes testified that her romantic relationship with Balwani had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani.html"><ins>abusive</ins></a>. Balwani’s trial is scheduled to begin <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-14/balwani-s-theranos-fraud-trial-delayed-as-holmes-fight-drags-on"><ins>in February</ins></a>.</p><p>There has been no shortage of pop culture depictions of Holmes. After Carreyrou’s best seller, <em>Bad Blood</em>, there was an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-09-the-inventor-hbo-theranos.html"><ins>HBO documentary</ins></a> and several podcasts about Theranos’ rise and ultimate downfall. Hulu is set to debut a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-theranos-series-the-dropout-march-3-222307396.html"><ins>new miniseries</ins></a> about the saga, with Amanda Seyfried starring as Holmes, in March. And Apple recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-movie-200124528.html"><ins>nabbed</ins></a> the Jennifer Lawrence-led film adaptation of <em>Bad Blood</em>.</p><p>Holmes, who will likely appeal the charges, could face up to 20 years in prison, though it&#39;s not yet clear when she will be sentenced. Following the verdict, the judge in the case said Holmes would be allowed to remain free on bail for the time being, though a new hearing &quot;to discuss any change in the conditions of Holmes&#39; liberty&quot; could come as soon as next week, according to <em>Mercury News</em> reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanbaron/status/1478172178352771076">Ethan Baron</a>. Prosecutors also asked for Holmes bail conditions to be changed, which would require her &quot;to put up cash or property, rather than just her signature, to cover her $500,000 bail.&quot;</p><p>The judge also declared a mistrial on the three wire fraud charges that had left the jury deadlocked. The mistrial leaves open the possibility of a new trial, though the prosecutors haven&#39;t said whether they would pursue such an action.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-verdict-guilty-fraud-001725594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66c4f3e6-b097-45cb-8eaf-d81405c6c03e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:17:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641259554</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T01:25:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Holmes, founder and former CEO of Theranos, arrives for motion hearing on Monday, November 4, 2019, at the U.S. District Court House inside Robert F.

The Cypress Hero Backpack has a built-in location tracker that could help its rightful owner find it through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">Find My network</a> if it goes missing. Conversely, if you misplace your iPhone, you can press a button on the backpack to ping your phone, as long as you&#39;ve set things up in the Targus app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/targus/">Targus</a> says the tracker is &quot;highly integrated&quot; into the backpack, which should offer some additional anti-theft protection. You can set up geofencing alerts, so if the backpack moves out of a certain area, you&#39;ll receive an alert. The tracker also has a built-in sound alert (which will likely be around as loud as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a>) that you can trigger remotely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracker has a replaceable battery that you can top up via USB, though Targus says it will run for around a year before you need to recharge it. Targus crafted the backpack with sustainability in mind, as it&#39;s made with 26 recycled water bottles. The Cypress Hero Backpack, which has an IPX3 water resistance rating, should be available sometime in the spring or summer. It costs $150.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f595fb0-6810-11ec-afcf-ca235cdcce81" alt="Targus DOCK720 docking station." data-uuid="d3ffb672-3fd8-3073-9817-1868767b1aef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Targus</div></figure><p>On top of that, Targus announced the DOCK720, a docking station that supports a single 8K monitor or up to four 4K monitors. The company says it&#39;s the &quot;first biometric device and docking solution in one&quot; — in other words, it has a fingerprint reader. You can expect an array of ports too, including USB-A, USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI and a combo audio jack. The dock will be available this month for $443.</p><p>The Targus Docking Display, meanwhile, is a 24-inch 1080p LCD monitor with a built-in 2MP webcam, microphone, speakers and USB-C docking station. You can daisy chain it to a second monitor and power both displays from your computer. The Docking Display will ship in February. The primary monitor costs $400 and the secondary monitor (which doesn&#39;t have a webcam) is $180.</p><p>In addition, Targus is expanding its lineup of antimicrobial products, which now includes backpacks, shoulder bags and protective sleeves for laptops. The company claims its DefenseGuard Antimicrobial Protection effectively prevents the growth of 99.9% of germ-causing microorganisms.</p><p>It will also release the UV-C LED Disinfection Light next month after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html">debuting it at CES 2021</a>. For five minutes every hour, the $300 device will bathe a surface (or, more likely, a keyboard and mouse) in ultraviolet light to effectively kill 99 percent of pathogens.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/targus-smart-backpack-apple-find-my-tracker-docking-station-monitor-disinfection-light-230012642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8b9f0f-4bca-420b-bcc1-3c3d78445d19</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 23:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221478</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Targus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Targus Cypress Hero Backpack with a built-in location tracker.

One of the limitations of those devices is that they typically only include one monitoring function. In the long run, that’s something that can cost you extra money if you move and end up with too many of one sensor and not enough of another. Security camera maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arlo" href="https://fave.co/3EPKaj4">Arlo</a> may have an elegant solution for that problem.</p><p>At CES 2022, the company introduced a security system that includes an all-in-one multi-sensor with eight monitoring functions. It can detect motion (including door and window openings), water leaks, light and temperature changes, as well as sounds made by T3 and T4 smoke alarms. Each sensor is about an inch wide and connects to a modular hub that includes a backlit keypad and NFC connectivity so that you can use your phone to activate and disarm the system. The hub is also compatible with Arlo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">various security cameras</a> and its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Secure subscription service" href="https://fave.co/3CQaola">Secure subscription service</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Arlo Security System will go on sale sometime in the first half of 2022, according to a statement the company shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"><em>The Verge</em></a>. It promised to disclose more information, including details on pricing, closer to release. The company didn’t have anything to say about the Security System’s smart home integrations today, but it did announce that it will support the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html">Matter</a> standard moving forward.

In 2021, Norwegian dealerships sold 176,276 cars, 65 percent of which were EVs. That’s an 11 percentage point increase from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-traditional-engines-in-norway-for-all-of-2020-115746618.html">year prior</a> when they accounted for 54 percent of all new car sales.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tesla Model 3 was the most popular choice among new buyers followed by Toyota’s hybrid RAV4, the only car with an internal combustion engine to make the country’s top-ten best-selling list.

As in 2020, much of what’s driving EV adoption in Norway is the country’s generous subsidies. Car buyers don’t have to pay taxes imposed on traditional internal combustion engine vehicles when they buy an EV. In 2021, the country’s federal government missed out on approximately $3.41 billion in tax revenue to push forward on its plan to end all gasoline-powered car sales by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-gas-cars-norway-2021-185544342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4a1c81a-151f-4b64-93d5-7523b1fa1fe6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 18:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238950</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:42:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz boasts 620-mile range for its latest EV concept]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="851681933b794e2c93d36a9c065d33ce"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEVZWNbn7ys?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Mercedes-Benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> has <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-211879a94f6a1a0ff764674cdc0a8630-vision-eqxx-taking-electric-range-and-efficiency-to-an-entirely-new-level">unveiled</a> a concept electric vehicle it claims would be able to run for more than 620 miles before needing to recharge. Should it come to fruition and live up to that promise, the Vision EQXX would beat the range of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html">Lucid Air Dream Edition</a> by more than 100 miles and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-400-mile-epa-range-104057637.html">Tesla Model S Long Range Plus</a> by around 220 miles.</p><p>&quot;The Mercedes-Benz Vision EQXX is how we imagine the future of electric cars,&quot; Mercedes-Benz head Ola Källenius said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on the automaker&#39;s simulations, the Vision EQXX would use less than 10 kWh to travel 62 miles on public roads, delivering an efficiency of more than 6 miles per kWh. Converted into fossil fuel consumption, Mercedes says that&#39;s around the &quot;golden figure&quot; of 1 liter of gasoline per 62 miles.</p><p>The battery is half the size of and 30 percent lighter than the one in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">EQS</a>.

The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What&#39;s more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.</p><p>Teams from Mercedes&#39; research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept. They harnessed digital tools to reduce waste and weight by cutting out excess material — the wheels are made with magnesium and the brake discs are built with aluminum alloy. The Vision EQXX uses recycled and plant-based materials too.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the interior, the Vision EQXX&#39;s infotainment system has a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a> in the EQS, it spans almost the entire width of the cabin, though this is a one-piece display.

The most intriguing of them is a new version of the Chromebook Spin 513 (pictured above), one of Acer&#39;s mid-range options. While the company already sells a few different configurations of the Spin 513, this new model has a somewhat unusual processor on board. It&#39;s using MediaTek&#39;s eight-core Kompanio 1380 processor, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. In the past, I&#39;ve been reluctant to recommend Chromebooks without Intel processors, but I won&#39;t write this one off without testing it first.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming the processor holds up, there are some other things to like about the Chromebook Spin 513. This year&#39;s model has a 13.5-inch touchscreen with a 2,256 x 1,504 resolution; that&#39;s a 3:2 aspect ratio like the Chromebook Spin 713 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">I reviewed last year</a>. The Spin 713 is an expensive Chromebook at $699, but the Spin 513 is priced at $599. That&#39;s not cheap, but I&#39;m glad to see Acer put this 3:2 display on a less expensive option. As the name suggests, the Flip 513 has a 360-degree hinge so the laptop can be flipped around into tablet mode as well as &quot;tent&quot; mode for watching video. Unfortunately, we&#39;ll have to wait until June for this laptop to go on sale.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other two new Acer Chromebooks are budget options, both priced at $299. The 2022 Chromebook 315 is a 15.6-inch laptop, and its large 1080p panel (touchscreen optional) is the main selling point here. Other specs are pretty standard for this price range: Intel Celeron or Pentium Silver processors, up to 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage and about 10 hours of battery life. The Chromebook 314, on the other hand, is essentially the same as the 315, it just has a smaller, 14-inch 1080p screen. The Chromebook 315 will be on sale this month in the US, but the 314 won&#39;t be available until June.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-513-2022-price-specs-170038270.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cb4a04a-91ad-4dd4-995e-2035b2bc5aad</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238438</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:34:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kohler's fog-emitting smart 'Stillness Bath' is yours for $8,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/kohler/"><ins>Kohler</ins></a> has revealed when you&#39;ll be able to snag the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-of-ces-2021-winners-215307033.html"><ins>Stillness Bath</ins></a> it unveiled at CES 2021, as well as a number of other smart home products. The bath, which takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing, aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog and aromas. All aspects of the experience can be controlled through Kohler&#39;s Konnect app. The Soak Freestanding Bath model will cost around $8,000 and you&#39;ll be able to order it by the end of March.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5ab62d0-6ca9-11ec-bfe6-274df13e359c" style="height:2551;width:2999;" alt="Kohler&#39;s Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas." data-uuid="7b662552-7b9c-3d92-9f3b-4a0d61a022ab"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>Another model offers voice control and another, called the Infinity Experience, fills from the bottom and water overflows into the wood base.

The device will turn or off with a wave of your hand, though you&#39;ll still need to use a physical handle to set your preferred temperature. The faucet will automatically switch off after two minutes and when you set it to Vacation Mode, users can be assured it won&#39;t turn on accidentally while they&#39;re away. The device will ship later this year and cost $199.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9259c90-6ca9-11ec-bfdf-3dac9635110c" style="height:1152;width:1770;" alt="The control panel for Kohler&#39;s PerfectFill system, which allows owners to control the depth and temperature of their bath water without monitoring it manually." data-uuid="d56c4fba-64d1-3d8b-8cf9-7f86ddc95181"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, Kohler has announced pricing and availability for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-13-smart-bathrooms-at-ces-2018.html">PerfectFill smart bathing tech</a>. The system allows you to fill your bath to a specified depth and temperature through a voice command, control panel or the Konnect app. You can have up to 10 presets, and you&#39;ll be able to drain the bath using a voice command too. The system — which pairs with a Kohler digital valve, shout and compatible bath — will be available to buy in May, and it starts at $2,700.</p><p>Later this month, Kohler will start shipping home water monitors that it developed with the help of Phyn. The H2Wise systems can monitor water use on every home fixture. Along with alerting homeowners immediately when they detect a leak, the systems will offer detailed insights about home water use. They also use pressure sensing to look for crystals forming in pipes, so they can alert users before pipes freeze and burst.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4002acc0-6caa-11ec-8fff-4a9437db4297" style="height:2004;width:3000;" alt="Kohler H2Wise water monitoring system connected to pipes" data-uuid="47464976-4d3e-3f64-81fe-172e74a794c6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>The DIY version (H2Wise) can be installed under a single sink, while the pro model, H2Wise+, is attached to the home&#39;s main valve and can shut off water throughout the residence if it detects a leak. As well as the Kohler app, you can connect the units to voice assistants. The DIY model costs approximately $400, and Kohler says the pro version (which can also be used outdoors) will be an estimated $666.70.</p><p>Among the other products Kohler will release this year is the Power Reserve Energy Storage System, which can pair with solar panel systems to store energy they produce. The battery can act as a backup for outages or to power the home using stored solar energy and reduce dependence on utility power. You can also prioritize the use of stored energy during peak usage times to lower the cost of your utility bills.</p><p>There could be a benefit for homes that don&#39;t have solar panels, as the system can store energy from the power grid at times of lower electricity usage. Kohler Power Reserve will start at around $13,325 for a system with a 10 kWh battery capacity, though you can have up to 20 kWh.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kohler-stillness-bath-pricing-availability-hands-free-faucet-home-energy-storage-155808475.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44bdb3fd-508c-4857-a056-b5a56b6ee821</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:58:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238381</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:33:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kohler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kohler's Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kohler Stillness Bath]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag is the cheapest it's ever been at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s AirTags can be a good way to keep track of that new backpack or wallet you were gifted during the holidays, and now you can grab one of the trackers for less. Amazon has a single <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirTag" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ">AirTag</a> for $24, which is $5 less than usual and a new record-low. The only time we&#39;ve seen AirTags for less than this was during a Woot sale on a four-pack. This, however, is the best price we&#39;ve seen if you want just one of the trackers — and while it&#39;s a relatively small discount, it&#39;s a good deal on an accessory that rarely goes on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ" id="e0c890e637b1452882acc1322a6ad312" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirTag at Amazon - $24</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are designed to work with iPhones, which means you&#39;ll get a pretty seamless experience from the moment you take the coin-sized tracker out of the box. The Find My app will immediately recognize the AirTag and you can label it with the name of whatever it&#39;s attached to. Since there&#39;s no keyhole on the AirTag, you will need some sort of case or holder if you want to secure the tracker to your keys, but you can find <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">affordable AirTag accessories</a> easily across the web. Given how small AirTags are, they&#39;ll easily slip into a pocket of your bag or a fold in your wallet without trouble.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once set up, you can return to the Find My app to locate your missing things and you can force the AirTag to emit a chime so you can more easily find your stuff if you&#39;re still relatively close to it. Plus, if you have an iPhone that supports ultra-wideband, the AirTag&#39;s Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your stuff with directions on your handset&#39;s screen. You may have to wait a bit to get the AirTag as Amazon&#39;s estimated delivery time is at the end of January, but now&#39;s a good opportunity to add an AirTag to your Apple setup and save a bit of money while doing so.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c56f72ad-cab7-435d-95a5-21e94204094d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:38:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641224301</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's workout-ready Elite 4 Active earbuds are now available for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">Jabra debuted</a> its ultra affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Elite 3</a> earbuds. That model offers all of the core features you&#39;d expect from a set of true wireless earbuds with good sound quality, solid battery life and a comfy fit. And all of that only costs you $80. There were some omissions — most notably the lack of active noise cancellation (ANC) — but the company is officially debuting a new option at CES that checks even more boxes while keeping the price low: <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">the Elite 4 Active</a>.</p><p>While these earbuds <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">made an early appearance</a> in the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-wireless-earbuds-142911217.html">last week</a>, Jabra <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jabra-boosts-new-years-fitness-resolutions-with-new-jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-301452531.html">has now officially announced</a> the new set for the US. The Elite 4 Active features a similar design to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">the range of new earbuds</a> the company began announcing last year. This means the buds should be comfy due to their smaller size and recently redesigned shape. As the name implies, the Elite 4 Active is built to withstand sweaty workouts with an IP57 waterproof rating.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4c75d991-0fbc-4640-923b-11d3954bc63d"/><p>In terms of audio, the Elite 4 Active houses 6mm drivers and you can tweak the EQ via Jabra&#39;s app. This new model also features ANC, which the more affordable Elite 3 does not. The only caveat is that it&#39;s not adjustable like the noise cancellation on the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a> earbuds. Jabra&#39;s transparency mode, HearThrough, is available on the Elite 4 Active to allow you to hear your surroundings when needed. Four mesh covered microphones assist with calls and Jabra says their design will reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Elite 3, you can expect up to seven hours of battery life with an additional three charges in the case. Jabra has also included features like the ability to use either earbud solo, Google Fast Pair, Alexa built-in and Spotify Tap playback. The best part?

It has a minimalist design, a lovely 7-inch display, clearer and louder audio than its predecessor and faster performance as well. It&#39;s just the right size to fit into any room without taking up too much space, and you can even place it on your nightstand and it will track your sleep.

It&#39;s the smart speaker to get if you care at all about audio quality and already rely on the Google Assistant a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Mini</a> may seem like an attractive option at $25, but you get what you pay for. Like its Amazon counterpart, the Echo Dot, the Nest Mini is an affordable way to get the Google Assistant into a small place but you&#39;ll sacrifice quite a bit on sound quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> is for those who want to go all in on both sound and Google smart devices. It has the best audio quality of them all plus a 10-inch display, gesture controls and the ability to double as a Nest Cam. It would make a good home-base smart display, one that sits in your living room or kitchen so everyone in your family has access to it when necessary.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-drops-to-60-in-new-years-sale-144818377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa6e7d7c-f270-4d20-bae9-a70f478d7b72</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 14:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221303</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:48:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub 2021 (2nd gen) photo.

The game forces you to do things like squat, jog in place and more to move your character through a fantasy world, making it a more interesting way to work out at home, especially during the winter months. Amazon has the pack for $55, or $25 off its usual price, and it&#39;s currently in stock as of writing this, so you can get your hands on it fairly quickly. The price only appears on the product page if you&#39;re a Prime subscriber, but it&#39;s available for all and it will show up once you have the game in your cart.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31jevsm" id="af4d3c5a87d7429bb047e10a2d3d0dc8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ring Fit Adventure at Amazon - $55</a><p>Designed to work with the Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-ring-fit-adventure-winter-workout.html"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a> tracks motion using the console&#39;s Joy-Cons. One straps to the provided ring while the other attaches to a leg strap so it can keep track of both upper- and lower-body movements. Like regular games that don&#39;t have a sneaky exercise component, you&#39;ll design your character when you first boot up the title and they&#39;ll immediately be plopped into a new world that&#39;s ready to be explored. Only here, you&#39;ll do so by running in place and completing exercises like leg lifts and crunches to defeat enemies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> won&#39;t replicate a treadmill run or even a strength-training workout video you can follow along, but that&#39;s ultimately the point of an exercise-based game like this. It&#39;s designed to provide a unique workout that doesn&#39;t feel like a regular fitness routine. We also appreciate that the game targets all part of the body with the moves it asks you to do, and you can customize it a bit by choosing the exercises you want to run through. There&#39;s also a handy &quot;quiet mode&quot; that removes actions like jumping up and down and instead focuses on lower-impact moves.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-ring-fit-adventure-is-back-on-sale-for-55-135758105.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">611479af-ca2c-4793-aa1f-45c90a318a21</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:57:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641218283</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T13:58:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tech that helps with those New Year’s resolutions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new year.

As part of her <a href="https://www.regeringen.dk/nyheder/2022/statsminister-mette-frederiksens-nytaarstale/">New Year’s Address</a>, she said that (translated) “by 2025, Danes must have the opportunity to fly green on a domestic route.” She added that “by 2030 at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” It was part of a broader commitment by the leader to toughen measures against polluters and to jump-start the country’s green transition.</p><p>There are, however, reasons to be concerned that such an ambitious deadline can be reached, given the lack of ready alternatives. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">Electric planes may never succeed</a>, and hydrogen flying, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">while much more promising</a>, is nowhere near ready to be rolled out to a major airline’s fleet. Not to mention, of course, that only hydrogen produced as a result of electrolysis, powered by excess renewable energy, can be called truly “green.” <a href="https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article12437427.ece"><em>EnergiWatch</em></a> has said that Denmark’s standing policy of waiting for magic bullet technologies to come to fruition is not going to help it reach its international commitments on climate emissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Denmark has made more steps than some countries to help make the transition toward zero-carbon technologies. The country has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-to-end-offshore-oil-gas-pumping-by-2050-162837374.html">issued a hard deadline</a> to end oil and gas exploration and is a big player in the wind power industry. At the start of 2021, it committed to build an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-energy-island-north-sea-wind-power-140022879.html">artificial island</a> which could collect and store power from Denmark’s wind farms, enough to supply 10GW. At the same time, the country hopes that any excess wind power can be used to drive an electrolyzer, helping it develop a nice sideline as a producer of guilt-free Hydrogen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/denmark-pledges-green-domestic-flights-by-2030-101536240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2001297e-d119-458d-92eb-567c9196dd9d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641202848</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T09:40:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbus A320 SAS Airlines.

That&#39;s the basic idea behind Alienware&#39;s Concept Nyx, a server that&#39;s powerful enough to run all of your games throughout your home network. Think of it like Plex for gaming, but instead of opening up your video library, it&#39;s all about bringing your games to all of your devices.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="54ce5d27-bc2d-4b74-b9be-83a73968f1f9"/><p>Given the push toward game streaming  from Google Stadia and Xbox, Alienware may have stumbled on an interesting solution for multi-gamer homes. You could conceivably run two games at once on your television, as we saw during a recent demo in NYC. Or you could play <em>Cyberpunk</em> while someone else perfects their <em>Rocket League</em> skills on another device. Since all of the rendering and network processing is happening in your home, Nyx would also be a lower latency experience than traditional cloud gaming, which relies on servers hundreds of miles away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Concept</em> is the key word here, though. Alienware representatives wouldn&#39;t tell us what&#39;s powering the mysterious Nyx server, which looked like an enormous gaming desktop. And while my colleague Cherlynn Low and I were able to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> simultaneously on a single TV, the games were running in tiny windows. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near the sleek half-screen experience Dell is showing off in promotional pictures.</p><p>Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ufo-portable-gaming-pc.html">Alienware&#39;s Concept UFO</a>, a Switch-like portable gaming PC that was first demoed two years ago, Nyx may never see the light of day. But we could see elements of it in future products, much like the way the UFO controller is being used demonstrate Nyx. The game server concept could eventually simplify streaming from your rig. That&#39;s something we can already do with Steam&#39;s Remote Play feature, but perhaps Dell could make it a bit easier to play all of your titles throughout your home. The company says it&#39;s also exploring ways to run four games at once, as well as methods of collecting all of your titles, no matter where you installed them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20402-6989-11ec-b3f5-e7fa8bacb0d1" alt="Alienware Concept Nyx UFO Controller" data-uuid="b80a62dd-a72b-3174-822f-6e3966d29f38"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-concept-nyx-game-server-050141873.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87304ad2-084a-465a-8503-1128f18f48ea</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 05:01:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221515</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is putting NFTs in its smart TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given that 2021 was a blockbuster year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-products-and-companies-2021-143005186.html">for NFTs</a>, it’s not particularly surprising that major tech companies are incorporating Non-Fungible Tokens into their CES lineup.
