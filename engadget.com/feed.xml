Key among them are the Surface Duo 2, Microsoft&#39;s second-gen version of its dual-screen, tablet-smartphone hybrid that now has a formidable triple-camera array, and the Surface Pro 8, a powerful update to the Pro 7 that adds 11th-gen Intel processors, a 13-inch screen with Dolby Vision and Thunderbolt 4 ports. Plus, you can also pre-order the high-powered Surface Laptop Studio, the updated (yet still affordable) Surface Laptop Go 3 and a Wi-Fi only Surface Pro X.

The new detachable keyboard will also have a slot for the new Slim Pen 2.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-microsoft-surface-duo-2-surface-pro-8-surface-laptop-studio-surface-pro-x-surface-go-3-161010924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7411862c-256d-48a8-8e7a-4acb400cd2d5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 16:10:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632327012</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:10:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ac64a200-1b07-11ec-aedf-7a84e6d76c5b" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ac64a200-1b07-11ec-aedf-7a84e6d76c5b" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Duo 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Duo 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft made a wireless mouse out of recycled ocean plastic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alongside a fresh lineup of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface">Surface</a> systems, Microsoft announced a new mouse at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021">fall hardware event</a>.

Refreshes of the Surface Pro and Surface Go aren’t surprising, and the company did show off the latest in both of those series. But the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop Studio" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">Surface Laptop Studio</a> is the most intriguing. It’s meant to replace the Surface Book, which was a detachable 2-in-1 laptop. The Laptop Studio, meanwhile, is more like Microsoft’s Surface Studio all-in-one desktop, in that it features a pull-forward screen that can lay flat on top of a table or be propped up at a slant. It also has a 120Hz display, as does the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Pro 8" href="https://fave.co/3kvnuNS">Surface Pro 8</a>, which got a sleek redesign.</p><p>I was able to check out the Laptop Studio, Surface Pro X and a slew of new Surface devices at a recent (COVID-safe) demo event in New York and I have to say, these Windows 11 PCs are looking very promising.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Surface Laptop Studio hands-on</h2><p>Let’s start with the Laptop Studio, which a Microsoft rep told me at the event will replace the Surface Book line. Like I mentioned, its new easel-style design is similar not only to its namesake <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html">Surface Studio</a>, but also to notebooks from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-acer-conceptd-7-ezel-pro-hands-on-price-specs-availability-conceptd-700.html">Acer </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-elite-folio-review-snapdragon-pc-180036528.html">HP</a>. I was very impressed with how thin the Laptop Studio’s 14.4-inch screen is, and it popped out of its frame without much force. The hinge connecting the display to the keyboard is sturdy, and kept the screen up at a variety of angles in laptop mode.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e3ef5a38-583a-4315-8a06-f4812710718c"/><p>When I flipped the screen to face outwards, though, I had trouble trying to push the lid away from me to get it to stand at a gentler angle as the panel popped out of the frame. But in every other configuration, such as a conventional laptop mode or laid down flat like a tablet (which Microsoft calls Studio mode), the Surface Laptop Studio behaved as expected.</p><p>When the screen is pulled forward and propped up in front of the keyboard in what the company calls Stage mode, it’s great for digital artists. It’s easier to draw on, and you can use the new Slim Pen 2 to create your masterpieces. The new stylus offers haptic feedback with an onboard motor and also mimics the resistance you’d get with pen on paper. I did feel a sort of drag across the Laptop Studio’s screen when I started doodling on it with the Slim Pen 2. It felt odd at first, as I’m accustomed to other styli like Samsung’s S Pen. But I got used to it quite quickly, and kind of liked feeling the mild vibrations that served as an indicator that something had been enabled.</p><p>The Laptop Studio has a magnetic strip under the keyboard that lets the Slim Pen 2 attach easily and remain flush with the rest of the machine. The magnets were strong enough that I only had to roughly place the stylus along the edge and it flipped into place. I don’t feel like I’d need to worry about losing the accessory with this setup, which is nice.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4f029cf0-1bb3-11ec-b666-e9d301aa0ff7" alt="Surface Laptop Studio hands-on" data-uuid="511e71fc-e3c4-38ea-9eda-f36022bfb834"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Microsoft also offers a 120Hz screen on the Laptop Studio, and a company representative told me at the demo that the touch sampling rate is 100Hz. This should make for a smooth drawing experience, but also make scrolling and animations look super buttery. There’s no adaptive refresh rate available in the system — you’ll just get the option to choose between 120Hz or 60Hz in settings.</p><p>For all the detailed specs on the Laptop Studio, like its new Full HD webcam, its screen resolution, dimensions, processor and memory configuration options, I encourage you to check out our news post. For this hands-on article, I’d like to focus on my initial impressions of the devices I got to try out.  On that note, the last thing I’ll say about my experience with the Laptop Studio is that its keyboard and trackpad were spacious, and though its buttons were cushy and responsive, I prefer the keys on the Surface Laptop 4. For things like battery life, performance and other real-world observations, though, we’ll need to wait till we can test out a review unit.</p><h2>Surface Pro 8 hands-on</h2><p>Another device that got a visual overhaul this year is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html">the Surface Pro 8</a>. It’s not the only new Surface Pro unveiled today — there’s also the Surface Pro 7 Plus, which received a typical minor processor upgrade and looks very similar to older Microsoft tablets. The Pro 8, meanwhile, looks a lot like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html">the ARM-based Pro X</a>. But it uses 11th-gen Intel Core i5 or i7 chips and is therefore noticeably heavier. It also has a different ventilation design around its sides compared to the X, which was sealed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4711b270-1bb7-11ec-b79f-993ee91d37be" alt="Surface Pro 8 hands-on" data-uuid="f7e4c845-9d9b-3ccf-9c9c-5f0e5cc60764"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, the Pro 8 is impressively thin, with a 0.37-inch profile, and its built-in kickstand is even sharper. Its 13-inch screen is surrounded by an attractively thin bezel as opposed to the approximately inch-wide border around the Pro 7 Plus. The Pro 8 also features the same 120Hz refresh rate as the Laptop Studio, running at a 2,880 x 1,920 resolution.</p><p>Out of the box, though, the Pro 8 runs at 60Hz, and you can go into settings to bump this up to the higher rate. Meanwhile, the Laptop Studio refreshes at 120Hz by default. This difference is because the Pro 8 is designed to be a more portable device, and Microsoft expects people to want more battery life on the go. If your priority is smooth scrolling and inking (Slim Pen 2 is also supported here), then by all means go faster. But if you’re trying to squeeze every last minute out of the Pro 8, you might prefer to stick to the lower rate.</p><p>When you’re out of juice, you can charge the Pro 8 back up with Microsoft’s own connector or through one of the pair of USB-C ports. These support USB 4 and Thunderbolt 4, and can stream out up to two 4K displays at once. We weren’t able to test this during the limited time at our preview, and I can only really tell you that in general the Surface Pro 8 felt very much like a heavier Pro X. They use the same Signature Type Cover with the same comfortable keys and responsive trackpad, as well as onboard slot that holds and charges the Slim Pen 2.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5b7187c0-94ee-4876-984e-1e84a7bdfcee"/><p>Of all the other Surfaces Microsoft announced today — the Go 3, the new Pro X, the Pro 7 Plus and the Duo 2, only the last one is different in a significant way. The rest of the systems basically got incremental updates while maintaining a similar look to their predecessors.&nbsp;</p><h2>Surface Adaptive Kit</h2><p>I did want to call out the new Surface Adaptive Kit, though. It’s a set of labels and stickers that are designed to make Surfaces easier for people with different needs to use. There are translucent keycap labels to make buttons identifiable by touch, bump labels that add visual and tactile cues to keys or ports, as well as colorful indicators with matching cable wraps to make it more obvious which wires go into which sockets.&nbsp;</p><p>The colors I saw at the demo area were neon peach hued and I’m not sure if they’ll be appreciated by people with certain visual impairments (a pattern might be better for those who can’t distinguish between colors). But at least the keycap labels I saw came in different shapes and overall I appreciate the effort here.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="43255b30-fb2c-45ac-917d-4c234fb1e885"/><p>Microsoft led the way for accessibility tech in gaming with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-11-xbox-adaptive-controller-interview-ces.html">Xbox Adaptive Controller years ago</a> and though the Surface Adaptive Kit seems like a small product, it shows that the company is thinking in meaningful ways how to cater to people with different needs.</p><p>Though most of the new Surfaces that were unveiled today feel like incremental updates, the Laptop Studio, Duo 2 and Pro 8 at least bring a low-key level of excitement. Plus, these machines (Duo 2 aside) will all run Windows 11, which is already bringing new life to a stagnating PC industry. As always, we’ll need to test all these devices out for ourselves to see if they’re worth spending your money on, but you can already pre-order all of them today.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from </em>Microsoft&#39;s<em> fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-hands-on-surface-pro-8-pro-x-go-3-adaptive-kit-price-specs-160005455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ddd356e8-c1d6-41ed-b3ff-60e631158992</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:58:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632328082</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:28:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b71a2d50-1b5c-11ec-9fbf-107c359a08dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b71a2d50-1b5c-11ec-9fbf-107c359a08dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brian Oh / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft's 2021 lineup of Surface devices, including the Duo 2, Laptop Studio, Pro 8 and Go 3.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface event 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2 hands-on: Microsoft gets serious about its dual-screen phone’s cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e85d9e1e6d0c49e6a849de5347e0da55"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6p_lys1nMQ" title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>As we continue to wait for Microsoft to release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-surface-neo-duo-hands-on.html">the Surface Neo</a>, the company is already unveiling the second generation of its dual-screen Android phone. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/39tJy5e">Surface Duo 2</a> is a $1,500 device that’s slightly thinner than its predecessor and brings some serious camera improvements. Specifically, it now has three sensors instead of the lone 11-megapixel camera used in the last-gen setup. I had a chance to check out the Duo 2 briefly at a (COVID-safe) demo in New York, and I’m so far cautiously impressed by its updates.</p><p>Microsoft’s demo area wasn’t the best place to take memorable photos, but I did try out the Duo 2’s triple lenses on an Xbox controller. I easily switched from the main camera to the ultrawide and telephoto options, and also gave Portrait mode a go. I can’t judge the quality of these photos yet, since I could only view them on the Duo 2’s screens, but I already feel like the bugginess I experienced with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">the original Surface Duo</a> is mostly gone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That’s not surprising, since one of the biggest issues plaguing the Duo’s camera software was that it only had one camera that sat above the screen. You had to flip the phone so that the correct side was facing you when you wanted to take a selfie, and have the camera side face out for other shots. This meant the device needed to know which screen to activate based on how you were holding it.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1cb8d860-1b5c-11ec-bff4-42acc5d7ea95" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="df454000-727b-3023-b515-43c7354673f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>With the triple cameras sitting on the Duo 2’s back/outside and a 12-megapixel front-facing camera, there’s no longer a need to figure that out. It’s a shame, though: There’s also no longer a way to take photos without having the Duo 2 opened up; if you’re shooting with the rear cameras, you must use the device with both screens facing you.</p><p>The bulky camera bump also prevents you from flipping one of the screens all the way over to have both displays lay evenly back to back. I never really cared to do that with the original Duo since it was too wide to use as a makeshift phone, but it’s still disappointing that with this change, the Duo 2 will really mostly be used in Book mode. It’s no longer a phone-tablet hybrid.</p><p>I’m surprised at this functional shift, since one of the refinements Microsoft made with the Duo 2 is narrowing the device’s overall width. Each panel now measures 5.8 inches instead of 5.6 inches on the original, for a combined 8.3-inch screen as opposed to an 8.1-inch canvas. But they’re also taller, with resolutions of 1,344 x 1,892 instead of the older 1,350 x 1,800. This would have made the Duo 2 slightly more phone-like in shape, but in person I frankly couldn’t tell that it had changed in size at all.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/33322bf0-1b5c-11ec-b06f-eeb7741bd775" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="5d4d4c9f-6775-3d4c-948c-3d57c61e5a11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of, Microsoft claims that this is the thinnest 5G mobile device on the market. Indeed, at 5.5mm (or 0.21 inches) thick, the Duo 2 is certainly sleek. The company also introduced a slight curve on the inner edges of each screen — an effect that’s reminiscent of pages in an open book. This could potentially make it easier to drag apps across screens, which I was able to do quickly during my demo.</p><p>Another new feature that makes the Duo 2 feel faster than the original is its higher refresh rate. Both panels now run at 90Hz and are supposed to be in sync, too. I loaded up Engadget’s website and expanded it across the two displays, scrolling frenetically up and down on an article, and the two halves of the page did indeed keep pace with each other. I’m used to a 90Hz screen by now, thanks to long-term use of the Pixel 5, but it’s certainly a nice feature to see.</p><p>Microsoft also added support for its new Slim Pen 2, which offers haptic feedback so doodlers or artists can feel a vibration when they put the stylus to the screen. It also tries to mimic the feel and resistance of pen on paper, and I spent more time with this on the new Surface Laptop Studio than on the Duo 2.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47941130-1b5c-11ec-9ddf-126f74e2ecbc" alt="Microsoft&#39;s Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="2ba1e0c1-9bd1-3964-9c5e-1208e69b3e60"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Frankly, the fact that I encountered so few hiccups with the Duo 2 surprised me. The original Duo was riddled with bugs, and even simple things like expanding an app to span both displays were difficult. During my preview, this went smoothly. Admittedly, I didn’t spend much time with the Duo 2, so I’m still cautious about the seemingly improved software, but Microsoft has indeed been working on fixing past issues.</p><p>That responsiveness could also be attributed to the beefy Snapdragon 888 processor that powers the Duo 2, though we’ll have to perform real-world testing to be sure. We’ll also need to run our own battery test to see how long the Duo 2’s 4,449mAh cell lasts, as well as how successful Microsoft was at fixing the flaws of the original. I’m curious to see if the new triple camera system and the problems it introduces are a bane or boon to the Duo series, but for now I’m cautiously optimistic about the second Duo.

There was just no way to compete with other powerful notebooks when it required shoving full Windows PC, complete with a power-hungry CPU, into a large slate. Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop Studio" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, a new stab at building a powerful Surface notebook.</p><p>While it looks like a typical PC at first, a unique hinge allows you to pull the screen forward over the keyboard. And if you pull it all the way down, it turns into an easel, like a miniaturized version of the Surface Studio all-in-one. While I&#39;m sure some Microsoft fans may miss the sheer weirdness of the Surface Book&#39;s design, the Laptop Studio is clearly more functional for typical users. I&#39;ve yet to meet any Surface Book owners who actually use it in tablet mode very often — even flipping the screen around becomes a chore eventually.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1ce69a0-1bbe-11ec-bfda-8b9438708653" alt="Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="b66ffe94-36b2-3249-87a1-9e317ee48016"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>The Laptop Studio clearly has plenty of quirks of its own, too. Its lower half almost looks like two PCs stacked on top of each other, with an odd tiered design. And if its screen flexibility looks familiar, it may be because it takes a few cues from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-hp-spectre-folio-review.html">HP&#39;s leather-clad Folio</a>. That PC also let you pull out the screen and turn it into a tablet. It&#39;s a design I&#39;m surprised more computer makers haven&#39;t adopted, as it seems more genuinely useful than convertibles with screens that fold a full 360-degrees.</p><p>And just like the new Surface Pro 8, the Laptop Studio&#39;s 14.4-inch touchscreen is a step above most displays, thanks to its fast 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR support. Having a high refresh rate will make scrolling and just about any screen movement look smoother, but crucially it also makes scribbling with the Surface Slim Pen 2 more like writing on actual paper. The Laptop Studio also has a convenient storage and charging slot for that stylus below its screen (but of course, you&#39;ll have to buy it separately).</p><p>Surprisingly, Microsoft still held back a bit when it came to power. The Surface Laptop Studio features <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-11th-gen-h-series-cpus-ultraportable-gaming-213018614.html">Intel&#39;s quad-core 11th-gen H35 processors</a>, which were originally intended for ultraportable gaming notebooks. Those 35-watt chips will certainly be an upgrade over the Book 3&#39;s 10th-gen hardware, but you&#39;d think Microsoft would take this new model as a chance to spread its wings and cram in a six or eight-core CPU.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/adff9d00-1bba-11ec-b874-1edf94bcaacd" alt="Surface Studio Laptop" data-uuid="5bd82356-a7dc-3f03-8fa6-6cc6e774159c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>I&#39;d wager the company felt compelled to deliver something that was relatively light — the Core i5 Laptop Studio weighs 3.8 pounds, while the Core i7 model weighs 4 pounds. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t mind something a bit heavier if it meant fitting in a better processor. And it&#39;s not as if there aren&#39;t plenty of Surface options for people who care more about portability.</p><p>You&#39;ll get Intel Iris Xe graphics with the Core i5 Surface Laptop Studio, whereas the i7 model comes with NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti with 4GB of GDDR6 memory. We&#39;ve asked Microsoft to confirm the exact power usage of that GPU, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it&#39;s the same 45-watt version that&#39;s in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-11th-gen-intel-xps-15-xps-17-110017302.html">Dell&#39;s new XPS 15</a>. From my testing, it&#39;s still faster than the Book 3&#39;s GTX 1660 Ti, but it would easily get smoked by a full-powered RTX 3050 Ti in a gaming system.</p><p>The Surface Laptop Studio starts at $1,600 and is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available for pre-order today" href="https://fave.co/3AD4XVC">available for pre-order today</a>.

Middling hardware and consistently buggy software held back what could have been a compelling experience. But with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/39tJy5e">Surface Duo 2</a>, the company wants to change all that with a device that focuses on addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>Take one look at the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2021/09/22/introducing-new-surface-products-built-for-windows-11/">Surface Duo 2</a>, and you’ll notice it has a substantial camera bump. That might not seem like much of an upgrade, but it is because it means the Surface Duo 2 comes with a far more capable and versatile camera system than its predecessor. The original featured a single 11-megapixel above its right display. That meant you had to use that one camera for both selfies and regular shots. Add some imprecise software for switching between camera modes and the Surface Duo was never great at capturing snapshots.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2aa97400-1bbd-11ec-bbb7-51d05ee32c60" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="e278bac0-43ce-3f3c-9188-f0997fdba8cc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>With the addition of three new cameras, the Surface Duo 2 should at the very least allow you to capture a greater variety of shots. The triple rear camera array consists of a 12-megapixel wide-angle, a 12-megapixel telephoto and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide. The primary and telephoto cameras feature f/1.7 and f/2.4 aperture lenses, phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization.</p><p>Less noticeable, but welcome all the same, are the tweaks Microsoft has made to Duo’s signature dual PixelSense displays. The new model features slightly larger 5.8-inch AMOLED screens that combine into a single 8.3-inch display. They’re also brighter and feature a variable refresh rate of up to 90Hz for smoother scrolling.</p><p>Other notable features include a new sound system Microsoft says delivers stereo sound no matter how you hold or position the Surface Duo 2. On the side of the device, you’ll find a nifty ambient display that shows things like how much battery life you have. Oh, there’s also a new Obsidian black that is quite attractive, and you can attach a Surface Pen magnetically to the device.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/650f6780-1bbd-11ec-9fef-bdd7a591387d" alt="Surface Duo 2 " data-uuid="eacb8e70-a4eb-3f8b-91f5-38b9e4933dc1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Internally, the Surface Duo features a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888 processor</a> supported by 8GB of RAM. That’s a significant upgrade from the Snapdragon 855 the Surface Duo featured, which was already showing its age when the device came out in 2020. Moreover, with the move to Qualcomm’s latest silicon, the Surface Duo 2 adds 5G connectivity. In the US, Microsoft will sell a mmWave variant that will work with Verizon’s Ultra Wideband network. Powering everything is a 4,449mAh cell Microsoft claims provides all-day battery life. One thing to note is the Surface Duo 2 won’t come with a charger included in the box. You’ll either need to supply your own or buy the recommended 23W USB-C power adapter separately.</p><p>Pre-orders for the Surface Duo 2 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:open today" href="https://fave.co/39tJy5e">open today</a>, with general availability to follow on October 21st.

But it&#39;s easy to ignore how some of those changes can affect people with disabilities. Making a notebook thinner can <em>also</em> make it harder to open, for example. So to better equip its PCs to be more accessible, Microsoft created the Surface Adaptive Kit, a collection of add-ons that can help you find specific keys, locate ports and flip open your PC or kickstand.</p><p>While they may just look like a collection of simple stickers, it still shows that Microsoft is actually thinking of people with disabilities. The Adaptive Kit comes from its Inclusive Tech Lab, the same folks behind the revolutionary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-17-xbox-adaptive-controller-disabilities-gamepad-microsoft-tour.html">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>.

Microsoft still includes a microSD slot and an option for LTE data, at least, and the 11 hours of claimed battery life (appropriate for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11</a> machine)  is still solid.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the prices are largely the same. The Surface Go 3 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:pre-order" href="https://fave.co/2W33BV3">pre-order</a> today ahead of its October 5th launch starting at $400 with the Pentium chip, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You’ll likely want to spend $630 for the jump to the Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB SSD.  You’ll have to wait a while to buy LTE models that carry a $100 premium over their WiFi-only equivalents. And no, the keyboard cover ($100) and pen (starting at $100) aren’t included.</p><p>This update might be disappointing if you were hoping for an overhaul. It’s a speed bump for a design that hasn’t changed much since 2018, and the base version is still likely to be too slow for more than simple tasks. We wouldn’t rush to buy this incarnation if you already have a Surface Go — this is more for newcomers who prefer Microsoft’s tiniest Windows machine.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-release-date-specs-151539602.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">615dfa7e-dc8e-428f-91c5-8d3ce991ead6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:15:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632327425</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:17:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcee88f0-1bbe-11ec-bbfd-e83ba737b08d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcee88f0-1bbe-11ec-bbfd-e83ba737b08d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Go 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Go 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Slim Pen 2 offers paper-like haptic feedback]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It wouldn&#39;t be a major Surface launch without a new pen, and Microsoft is happy to deliver.

It features a 13-inch PixelSense screen, a significant upgrade from the previous 12.3-inch display. Even better, it&#39;s one of the first non-gaming notebooks we&#39;ve seen that supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes scrolling through web pages and jotting down notes a lot smoother. And of course, it&#39;s built with Windows 11 in mind.</p><p>Together with some of Intel&#39;s latest 11th-gen processors, as well as long-awaited support for Thunderbolt 4, the Surface Pro 8 could tempt over potential buyers who were turned off by the limitations of previous models. As much as I&#39;ve liked <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-16-surface-pro-6-review-tablet-pc.html">earlier Surface Pros</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-usb-c-price-specs.html">last model made it clear </a>that Microsoft seriously needed to change things up.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6a400cc8-7df6-4e44-bbae-092f2beb5d5e"/><p>Personally, I&#39;m just glad to see those chunky Surface bezels fade away. Over the last decade, Dell, ASUS and most other PC makers have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-10-tech-borderless-screen-bezels.html">focused on shaving down borders to cram in larger displays</a>. Microsoft proved it could do that with the Surface Pro X, but that refined design has been absent from the standard Surface line until now. The new 13-inch edge-to-edge Pixelsense touchscreen is 11 percent larger, 12.5 percent brighter and sports a 10.8 percent higher resolution, according to Microsoft. There are still some noticeable bezels along the top and front of the Surface Pro 8, but at least they&#39;re not unsightly (and they could be useful for holding it in portrait mode).</p><p>The Surface Pro 8 is also a major step forward under the hood: It can be equipped with up to a quad-core Intel Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. The LTE model caps out at 512GB of storage, but you&#39;ve also got the option of plugging in a 128GB or 256GB removable SSD at the bottom of the case. That&#39;s certainly a better option than the microSD card slot previous models had.</p><p>Microsoft claims the Surface Pro 8 is more than twice as fast as the Pro 7, something you can attribute both to that new Intel CPU and the improved Intel Xe graphics on the i5 and i7 models. You can expect 74  percent faster sustained graphics performance, as well as 40 percent better sustained CPU performance. Of course, we&#39;ll have to run our own benchmarks to confirm those figures.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9aded532-1bb8-11ec-bd69-e3bdc4ebf985" alt="Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="42f3e1c8-f287-39b5-9257-e416f3306ee7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Thankfully, the Surface Pro 8 finally supports Thunderbolt 4 on its two USB-C ports. That means you&#39;ll be able to connect fast external hard drives, several 4K external monitors or even an external GPU. As for other updates, the rear camera is now 10MP instead of 8MP, and it also supports 4K video. The front-facing camera is still 5MP with 1080p video, but it should offer better low-light performance. As for battery life, Microsoft says the Pro 8 should last up to 16 hours, a leap ahead of the estimated 10.5 on the Pro 7. You&#39;ll also be able to charge it up to 80 percent in over an hour.</p><p>While it&#39;s not a huge step up, I&#39;ll be interested to see how well the new Surface Slim Pen 2 works on the Pro 8&#39;s 120Hz screen. Microsoft&#39;s tablets have always offered some of the best digital inking around, but a faster screen should make jotting down notes feel even more like putting pen to paper. The Slim Pen 2 also features a haptic motor for realistic feedback, and it can be seamlessly tucked (and charged) in the Surface Pro Signature Keyboard.</p><p>And no, Microsoft still isn&#39;t bundling any of its keyboard covers with the Surface Pro 8. The new tablet is also slightly heavier than the Pro 7, clocking in at 1.96 pounds instead of 1.7. That may seem like a marginal difference, but it&#39;s something you&#39;ll feel in your wrist if you&#39;re actually using it as a tablet.</p><p>With a larger and more responsive screen, as well as more power, the Surface Pro 8 could be a serious competitor with ultraportables like Dell&#39;s XPS 13. We&#39;ve also seen other PC makers attempt to make hybrid devices like the Surface, but none of them have surpassed Microsoft&#39;s hardware.  Perhaps now, with even better hardware and a shiny new OS, Microsoft can finally convince more people to take a chance on the Surface Pro.</p><p>The Surface Pro 8 will start at $1,100 and is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available to pre-order today" href="https://fave.co/3kvnuNS">available to pre-order today</a>. It&#39;ll be on sale with the rest of the Surface lineup on Windows 11&#39;s launch date, October 5th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a0bc996-6412-47dc-bf53-6f8f6aa2348c</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:09:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632327454</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T16:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fa1c650-1bb7-11ec-a9e7-09a81d06a250" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fa1c650-1bb7-11ec-a9e7-09a81d06a250" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surface Pro 8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Surface Pro 8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon workers fired for cannabis use can reapply for jobs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html">looser stance on workers&#39; marijuana use</a> now covers people who were previously dismissed. The online retailer said it has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-is-supporting-the-effort-to-reform-the-nations-cannabis-policy">restored</a> employment eligibility for workers and applicants who were fired or rejected from unregulated roles (that is, not truck driving or similar jobs) after cannabis screenings. The company didn&#39;t promise to rehire recently fired workers or compensate them for lost earnings, but it may be helpful for those still looking for work.</p><p>The decision, as before, came down to a combination of equity and practical reality. Candidate marijuana screening &quot;disproportionately&quot; affects people of color, Amazon said. It also noted that varying state levels of legalized cannabis use made it harder to run a consistent and equitable drug testing program across the US. Amazon was also frank about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-to-pay-college-tuition-warehouse-worker-163326286.html">constant need for more workers</a> — dropping marijuana tests lets it &quot;expand [the] applicant pool.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move comes on top of recent political efforts, including lobbying for and otherwise supporting bills that reform the federal approach to marijuana. The Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (aka MORE Act), for instance, would purge criminal records.</p><p>Those measures aren&#39;t guaranteed to become law. However, Amazon&#39;s overall strategy is clear — it&#39;s determined to boost hiring, and it&#39;s betting that its sheer corporate clout can persuade lawmakers to widen the door for more recruits.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-reconsiders-worker-cannabis-marijuana-screening-142918217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c2a9934-40c9-4596-80ef-f3d6f486d190</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 14:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632320963</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T14:29:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44e14640-1ba9-11ec-9dff-e502fcedd99d" width="5151" height="3433" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44e14640-1ba9-11ec-9dff-e502fcedd99d" width="5151" height="3433" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee fills a cart full of items at Amazon's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

The university&#39;s Science and and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/csail">CSAIL</a>) created the kit using something called &quot;electrical impedance tomography&quot; (EIT), that measures internal conductivity to gauge whether muscles are activated or relaxed. The research could allow for wearables that monitor distracted driving, hand gestures or muscle movements for physical rehabilitation.&nbsp;</p><p>In a paper, the researchers wrote that EIT sensing usually requires expensive hardware setups and complex algorithms to decipher the data. The advent of 3D printing, inexpensive electronics and open-source EIT image libraries has made it feasible for more users, but designing a wearable setup is still a challenge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="741ad4aa124b4a4fb2cebb6963e1f4f2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIi0xiMexYU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To that end, the &quot;EIT-kit&quot; 3D editor allows users to enter the device parameters and place the sensors on a device that may go on a user&#39;s wrist or leg, for instance. It can then be exported to a 3D printer and assembled, and the final step is to calibrate the device using a subject. For that, it&#39;s connected to the EIT-kit&#39;s sensing mother board, and &quot;an on-board microcontroller library automates the electrical impedance measurement and lets you see the visual measured data, even on a mobile phone,&quot; according to CSAIL.</p><p>Where most wearables can only sense motion, and EIT device can sense actual muscle activity. The team built one prototype that could sense muscle strain and tension in a subject&#39;s thigh, allowing them to monitor muscle recovery after an injury. It also showed other possible uses, like gesture recognition, a distracted driving detector and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is working with Massachusetts General Hospital on rehabilitation tech using the devices while refining the tech. The eventual aim is to develop &quot;rapid function prototyping techniques and novel sensing technologies,&quot; said lead author Junyi Zhu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-toolkit-allows-you-to-design-your-own-health-monitoring-wearables-130010870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a7f106c-a054-4009-9f63-fcfe0c3ac7c6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632318255</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T13:44:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT/CSAILs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPad mini review (2021): The best small tablet gets a facelift]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="f30705edd63d4e839870bd1ba5f03418"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJAQPqh3DeM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>It’s almost comical how stagnant the iPad mini has been in recent years. The 2019 version sported an upgraded processor and a slightly nicer display, but essentially looked the same as the tablet that debuted in 2012 (which is dated, to say the least). That hasn’t stopped the iPad mini from gaining a loyal following though, and we even called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-ipad-mini-review-2019.html">2019’s mini</a> our favorite small tablet.</p><p>Now it appears that Apple’s giving the tablet the love that its devotees have been asking for. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:6th-generation iPad mini" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">6th-generation iPad mini</a> is really more of an iPad-Air mini with its new “all-screen” Liquid Retina design, TouchID-capable top button, second-generation Apple Pencil support and USB-C charging. It’s the most significant update the mini has received in years, and Apple’s hoping you’ll pay extra for it. The 2021 iPad mini starts at $499, $100 more than its predecessor’s starting price, and with that Apple is squashing any notions that “smaller” means “lesser.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and hardware</h2><p>Many people, myself included, were happy to see the facelift Apple gave the iPad mini. While the old design with the physical Home button isn’t necessarily bad (it’s still good enough for the new 10.2-inch iPad, apparently), it felt boring on the mini after seeing it unchanged for so many years. This year’s iPad mini has what Apple calls an “all-screen” design, which is just different enough from the “edge-to-edge” display that the iPad Pros have to warrant discussion.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e4f7be3d-d63a-4f67-9484-f4ac28054fee"/><p>I understand why Apple didn’t want to give the mini the same “edge-to-edge” moniker, but it could have come up with something a bit better than “all-screen.” The bezel surrounding the 11-inch iPad Pro’s screen is roughly 0.25-inches thick and that of the iPad mini is only about 1/8th of an inch thicker than that. That’s not a huge difference, but it’s more noticeable when you’re only working with an 8.3-inch display. Also, the previous iPad mini had a 7.9-inch display, so you’re not getting a ton of extra screen real estate on the new model.</p><p>That said, I found the bezels to be just the right size. Notably, they helped me get a better grip on the mini when I was using it as an e-reader, and I can only assume many mini owners will do the same. The same could be said for when I was watching YouTube videos while carrying the mini around my apartment — I never accidentally paused the playing video because the bezels gave me enough room to hold the device.</p><p>The new mini’s display size and the fact that it’s a Liquid Retina panel are the upgrades here, because the 5th-gen model supported TrueTone, 500 nits of brightness and the P3 color range as well. This year’s mini has a 2266 x 1488 resolution, 326ppi panel, which is only slightly higher than the old model’s 2048 x 1536 resolution, 326ppi screen. If you upgrade from the 2019 mini, you may not notice a huge difference in quality, but the rounded-rectangle shape of the new mini’s display and the revamped design overall gives it a fresh feel.</p><p>Otherwise, I felt like I had a small version of the iPad Air the entire time I was using the mini. Their designs are very similar, save for the location of certain buttons. The iPad mini now has flat edges with a TouchID-capable power button and volume adjusters at the top and a USB-C port at the bottom. Notably, its edges lack a headphone jack and that may be a key factor for current iPad mini owners in their decision to upgrade or not. It’s made of 100-percent recycled aluminum, weighs less than one pound and measures 6.3mm thick — just as portable as the last model, but with a much-needed modern aesthetic.</p><p>TouchID is nothing different from older iOS devices, although it may take you a tad longer to set up because of how narrow the fingerprint-sensitive button is. It’s exciting that Apple finally brought USB-C to yet another iPad as it makes charging more efficient but it also continues to feed us poor saps who yearn for a USB-C iPhone sometime in our lifetimes. Also, the new design allows the second-generation Apple Pencil to neatly and magnetically stick to the right edge of the tablet.</p><h2>In use</h2><p>I’ve been keeping the iPad mini by my side at all times for the past week or so, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy that was thanks to its size. Every iPad is portable, but some are certainly more portable than others. I have a 2020 11-inch iPad Pro and, while it could come with me almost anywhere, I mostly use it in my home as a secondary device or as my main driver when I’m traveling. The iPad mini, on the other hand, could fit into almost any bag I own without hassle, providing a much-needed larger screen for activities like reading, watching videos and FaceTime calls. I didn’t find it super difficult to use my thumbs to type on the mini, treating it almost like a super-wide iPhone, but I also wouldn’t call it a comfortable experience.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aeceff1e36a84ba194db4a2d654063b5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/703d1740-1ad9-11ec-87fd-a14d268b7118" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="c2a3a301-d3b4-3c9a-9a8a-9c012a14e273"></section><p>Speaking of FaceTime, the iPad mini comes equipped with the new 12MP ultra wide front camera that supports Center Stage, the feature that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls. Each time I used FaceTime, I could move around my (admittedly small) kitchen and the mini’s camera followed me so my family could always see most of my face. There’s a limit, of course — I often stepped out of the camera’s field of view, but it followed me until I was nearly out of the camera’s field of view. This is a handy feature for anyone like me who’s often multitasking while catching up with loved ones over FaceTime.</p><p>The rear camera is also better than that on the previous mini, but I wouldn’t consider it a huge selling point. It’s a 12MP wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED TrueTone flash and Smart HDR 3 support. It can also shoot 4K 60 fps videos and shoot Slo-Mo videos at up to 1080p 240 fps. We’ve all seen a tablet photographer in the wild, but considering the shooters on our phones are far-and-away more capable than those on tablets, most people turn to the smallest screen in their pockets for photography. The pictures of my fiancé and my cat that I took with the mini were just fine, but I found myself more inclined to use the rear camera as a document scanner with Evernote’s Scannable app. And even in that case, was it better than using my iPhone? Not necessarily, just more convenient when I was using the iPad mini as my default device.</p><p>I may not have been taking a ton of photos with the iPad mini, but I use it for almost everything else that I normally turned to my iPhone for. The A15 Bionic chip inside makes the mini feel zippy, and it handled everything that I threw at it well. I spent most of the time watching YouTube and Netflix videos, answering messages in Gmail and Slack, taking notes in Evernote, saving wedding inspo in Pinterest, browsing e-cookbooks in the Kindle app and doodling in Procreate and GoodNotes. The iPad mini didn’t falter once and, in comparison to my iPhone, the tablet’s larger screen made it a much better work companion when I was trying to be productive on the couch. The mini smoothly ran games like <em>Temple Run 2, Crossy Road</em> and <em>High Rise</em> as well, even if my attempts at beating those games were anything but.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6ff2c7d1-1ad9-11ec-9f1f-167f5d1d4fe1" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="b80c4ae9-f469-3a9b-8a68-f361326da19c"><figcaption>The 2021 iPad mini next to Amazon&#39;s Kindle Paperwhite.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While it didn’t affect the performance of the iPad mini I had, the storage capacity on the model you choose may have a significant impact on how you use your mini in the future. The tablet comes in 64GB and 256GB models, with the higher of the two costing $150 more than the other. That’s a significant difference in both capacity and cost, and it follows an unfortunate pattern in the iPad lineup — you’ll find the same pricing structure in the iPad Air configurations. The previous iPad mini had the same minimum storage capacity, so we didn’t even get an upgrade here and that’s a shame.</p><p>While I don’t think most people will be using the iPad mini as a laptop replacement, it would have been nice to have a 128GB model just to have an in-between option for those with tighter budgets. I would also hesitate to recommend the 64GB model to anyone that wants to use their iPad mini as the digital file folder for their documents, photos, books, scans and more. Considering iPadOS 15 takes up 7.5GB of space already, those people may quickly eat up most of their internal storage.</p><h2>With the Apple Pencil</h2><p>Another area that could eat up storage over time are handwritten notes, scribbles, doodles and other artwork you make with the second-generation Apple Pencil. The previous iPad mini supported the first-gen stylus, but I was thrilled to see the newer Apple Pencil snap on to the side of the mini and line up almost perfectly. The Pencil is almost as tall as the tablet so it truly feels like the two were made for each other.</p><p>Since I regularly use the Apple Pencil with my 11-inch iPad Pro, I was not surprised to find that using it with the iPad mini is a similar, yet more constrained, experience. But that’s not a bad thing — I actually think the iPad mini excels at being a digital notebook. It’s portable enough to come with you everywhere you go and it’s much easier to balance in your palm while you jot down notes during a walking meeting. Apple makes it really easy to take notes in iPadOS 15, too, with the Quick Note feature that’s accessible by swiping up from the bottom-right corner of the iPad. It opens a small window on the screen into which you can scribble a quick grocery list or something you don’t want to forget. Those Quick Notes get saved in the Notes app, where you can retrieve and edit them at any time.</p><p>Apple’s made the Notes app more robust over the years, so much so that it could be your main note-taking tool. But there’s no shortage of capable apps in which to use the Apple Pencil and I was happy to find that two popular ones, Procreate and GoodNotes, work just as well on the iPad mini as any other iPad. Serious artists will probably want to spring for an iPad with a larger screen because it just gives you more space to play with, both in regular and Split View. But those who are visual thinkers, those who prefer to sketch out their thoughts, will probably find the mini’s screen to be sufficient. For example, I’m in the early stages of planning a wedding and I took the iPad mini with me on a few venue tours. Not only was it much less ostentatious to take around than my larger iPad, but I could also snap quick photos with it, bring those images into Procreate, pull out colors I liked in venue fixtures and decorations and experiment with them in concept sketches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/705189a0-1ad9-11ec-b79e-f4c3ae445fad" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="8e92632f-c3cc-3928-90bd-49bea15bb6ea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Battery life</h2><p>One thing that hasn’t changed about the iPad mini is its estimated battery life. Just like the 2019 model, Apple estimates the slab should get up to 10 hours of battery life, and again, that’s a bit of a lowball. With how much I was using the device, I essentially had to charge it every other day. The mini lasted an entire afternoon and evening filled with doodling, video streaming, emailing, light gaming and more (I used it instead of my phone for almost every task), and I was able to use it most of the next day before the battery life dropped to around 10 percent. I also ran a makeshift battery test on it, playing a video clip on repeat until the tablet died, and the mini lasted just about 12 hours.</p><p>Unlike the previous mini, the new model uses a USB-C port for charging and it’s about time. It’s good to see Apple transitioning the iPad family to USB-C, even if most people looking to buy an iPad mini probably already have a few Lightning cables strewn around their home. The mini also comes with Apple’s 20W USB-C charger, which should help power-up the device quickly.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad mini&#x002019;s" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">iPad mini’s</a> spec sheet has changed quite a bit, but the appeal of the tablet remains the same. It looks and feels different thanks to the redesign and the handful of new features Apple brought to it. Still, the iPad mini remains one of Apple’s most niche devices. But niche doesn’t mean less-than — with the iPad mini so similar to the iPad Air, you won’t be sacrificing much by choosing it. However, I don’t think most people will take a look at all the new perks — things like a camera with Center Stage, USB-C charging and even the A15 Bionic chip — and be persuaded to choose the iPad mini over any other Apple tablet.</p><p>What it will come down to, as always, is size. The iPad mini remains the best small tablet out there and you probably already know if an 8-inch tablet has a place in your life. It either solves a specific problem, or it doesn’t — and if you fall into the second category, you probably prefer bigger screens anyway.</p><p>But if you updated in 2019 to the 5th-generation iPad mini, the decision to upgrade now is not entirely cut-and-dry and that’s mostly due to cost. If the 6th-generation iPad mini had the same $399 starting price as the previous model, it would be a no-brainer upgrade. Sure, that extra $100 does get you a lot, but if your 2019 iPad mini is still going strong, the higher price of the 2021 model may be too great. But for those who have a hole in their lives where a small tablet could fit, you (still) can’t get better than the iPad mini.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa628cfc-23bf-44f7-874e-02ef1d7dcf52</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632313056</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T12:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Guardians of the Galaxy' is already better than the 'Avengers' game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this point in the creeping global takeover of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, most people have a clear idea of who the Guardians of the Galaxy are, at least according to James Gunn. There’s the bald dude who’s a tree, Zoe Saldana in green body paint, the other bald dude who isn’t a tree, Bradley Cooper as a raunchy raccoon, and the guy who used to be on <em>Parks and Recreation</em>.</p><p>This isn’t the case in <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and that’s a good thing. The game introduces fresh versions of the Guardians and ensures players will get to know them, placing an active emphasis on relationship-building and teamwork, rather than running and gunning. Eidos-Montréal’s interpretation of the Milano crew is familiar but refreshing, and the characters in the game are just as charming as they are in the MCU — if not moreso.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee536e0-1b24-11ec-8f3f-bd5afd25cd11" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="f652380d-680c-3a89-b3b0-11bfa82c808d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>The preview for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> lasted about an hour and dropped me in the middle of chapter five: Star-Lord and his pals are on the Milano, debating whether they should pay a fine at Nova Corps headquarters. They banter and decide to do it, intermittently dealing with a purple-and-orange llama that’s stowed away on their ship from a previous mission. The llama’s name is Kammy. Drax, the vengeful yet simple warrior, calls it “the child.” It’s all very cute.</p><p>Star-Lord is the only playable character in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but he’s able to interact with and even direct his teammates, taking advantage of their unique skills as needed. For instance, Rocket, the foul-mouthed raccoon, is good at hacking doorways, crawling through vents and fixing things, though he’ll give you an earful while he does it.</p><p>By chapter five, Star-Lord has a handful of skills and tools, including the ability to scan his environments for areas of interest or weakness. Using this overlay turns the landscape into an infrared world of neon silhouettes and bright yellow clues. If Star-Lord himself can’t use a particular item, chances are someone on his team can, and he’s able to work with them once he’s found the way forward.</p><div id="d1021a88b7fe4184a7aa3406e589da8a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oki56MQfiHI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In combat, Star-Lord can instruct his crewmates to use their special moves at any particular time, and they also react automatically to nearby enemy behavior. For example, Star-Lord can freeze an enemy with his ice gun and Groot, the powerful tree creature, will start wailing on the frozen foe, no player input required. There’s also a huddle function that can turn the tide of a big battle — Peter Quill calls the team together and listens to their thoughts on how the fight is going, and then he determines whether to encourage them or check their egos using a range of 1980s pop-rock lyrics. If he picks the right tone, the entire team gets a big boost so they can start spamming attacks; if he picks the wrong words, only Star-Lord gets the damage augmentation.</p><p>Fights in chapter five are fast-paced and packed with enemies, meaning the Guardians are often spread across the environment, waging their own tiny wars. Star-Lord’s ability to call in his crewmates’ special powers adds a layer of rapid-fire strategy to the gunbattles, and this system should only become more robust as the game progresses.</p><p>Interacting with the Guardian NPCs is a critical component of the game’s non-combat moments, when players have to communicate and solve puzzles to progress. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> uses a Telltale-style narrative system that alerts players with text in the upper-right corner when something significant has gone down — think “Gamora will remember that” — and in conversation, there are often multiple responses for players to choose from, sometimes with a timer attached. Seemingly innocuous decisions, such as whether to respond to an audio cue, can significantly change how the game plays out, for instance jump-starting a battle or creating an opportunity for the Guardians to sneak in.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0824bb06a9354d119398b86dc336a5c0" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee4e8c0-1b24-11ec-b7eb-38923e2e0281" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="937f5467-08e2-383b-bbe7-635e3ec25d75"></section><p>Relationships are everything in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. The core theme of the game is grief, according to developers, and even as the Guardians joke their way across the stars, they each deal with a unique sense of loss. This is, ironically, what brings them together. The game&#39;s music plays into the emotional mood, with plenty of licensed ’80s hits and an original album from Star-Lord that taps into feelings of being an outcast and finding your chosen family.</p><p>It’s hard to say if Eidos-Montréal has captured the right balance of emotion and action throughout <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but the preview is encouraging. The developers aren’t afraid to let dialogue and puzzle-solving breathe for long stretches of the action, while battles themselves are full and frenzied. At any rate, it already feels way better than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-poor-sales-195000119.html"><em>Marvel’s Avengers</em></a>.</p><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is due to hit PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 on October 26th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/guardians-galaxy-game-preview-marvel-square-enix-130003598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">481fed65-48e6-4b88-a813-de096d46cb54</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632260918</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T21:48:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's department store plans reportedly include high-tech dressing rooms]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Amazon opens mini department stores <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-department-stores-122954800.html">as rumored</a>, they could include high-tech dressing rooms and the retailer&#39;s own private-label clothing brands, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report. The aim is apparently to address some of the normal irritants of clothes shopping, increase its own brand recognition and make the stores as efficient as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One idea is that customers would use a smartphone app to scan QR codes of items they want to try on. Associates would then gather the items and place them in fitting rooms, and the process could eventually become more automated with the use of robots.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once inside, you&#39;d be able to ask for more clothes using a touchscreen, which could also recommend items you might like based on what you&#39;ve chosen so far.

It has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-03-amazon-patent-mirror-virtual-clothes.html">patented a mirror</a> for trying on virtual clothes, but there&#39;s no sign yet that it would use such technology in department stores.

However, many luxury and high-end brands — which have the highest profitability — have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-amazon-fashion.html">resisted</a> listing goods online with Amazon.</p><p>Reports of Amazon department stores started popping up last month, with sites tipped to be around a third the size of regular department stores. At 30,000 square feet, however, they&#39;d still be larger than Amazon&#39;s other physical locations other than Whole Foods.</p><p>Even as some physical retailers including JC Penney and Niemen Marcus filed for bankruptcy, Amazon saw sales explode during the pandemic as users shopped online from home. However, customers surveyed recently by Wells Fargo said they preferred the physical department store experience and didn&#39;t want to pay for shipping if they weren&#39;t Prime members, the <em>WSJ</em> noted. On top of clothing, Amazon&#39;s department stores would reportedly allow it to showcase electronics like Fire TVs, readers, Echo speakers and more.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is still a rumor which hasn&#39;t been confirmed by Amazon, so take it with some skepticism.

The latter, meanwhile, will have responsibility for building the technology that will eventually see Project Artemis take people to the Red Planet.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-directorate-reorganization-175038234.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading.</ins></strong></a></p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-studio-controller-140007968.html"><ins>Akai built a &#39;cheap&#39; controller for its MPC 2 software (updated)</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-ultium-drive-motors-announcement-170022093.html"><ins>GM details the motors that will power its electric Hummer and other EVs</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-eqs-us-pricing-192646405.html"><ins>Mercedes-Benz&#39;s EQS EV starts at $103,360 in the US</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-signature-edition-130032095.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s new Kindle Paperwhites have bigger, brighter screens and USB-C charging</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-the-i-phone-13-review-is-here-111544232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e0c9ab36-6904-48c5-a059-94e7acebe407</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 11:15:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632308385</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T10:59:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e90ebae0-1b90-11ec-b7fe-3b689b0aa31a" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e90ebae0-1b90-11ec-b7fe-3b689b0aa31a" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Irmel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This robotic backpack follows its leader wherever you may wander]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2019, Boston&#39;s Piaggio Fast Forward company released the first iteration of an automated cargo hauler for pedestrians, dubbed the Gita (pronounced JEE-tah). Two years, and multiple design improvements later, PFF is set to release a smaller, more nimble version which they&#39;re calling the Gitamini<em>&nbsp;</em>this October.</p><p>With a cargo volume of up to nearly 2,000 cubic inches and capable of carrying up to 40 pounds of gear and traveling at a top speed of 6 mph, the original Gita was a startlingly large machine able to hold a shopping carts-worth of groceries and keep up with cyclists. However, the Gita&#39;s size made it a liability to other pedestrians when navigating on crowded sidewalks, especially the earlier versions that relied on a belt-mounted tracker to know where its owners were.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Gitamini, on the other hand, is about the size of a Border Collie (990 cubic square inches of cargo space) and weighs just 28 pounds. It can carry up to 20 pounds of gear and thanks to external handles the mini can easily be hoisted over curbs, stairs and other obstacles even when fully loaded. The mini is rated for a maximum range of 21 miles or around six hours of use before needing a recharge. What&#39;s more, PFF has traded in the belt-based tracker for advanced optics and machine vision. With the push of an onboard button, the <em>mini</em> will autonomously find, recognize and follow its &quot;leader&quot; using only visual and radar cues like color and motion — the robot does not require a GPS, cell, or wireless network connection in order to do so.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce7b2f20-1b17-11ec-87ff-69c44f5b199f" alt="Gita and mini" data-uuid="0c3e4abb-74ef-3c09-a4fb-1c0530af50d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Piaggio Fast Forward</div></figure><p>The mini is also equipped with what the company is calling &quot;pedestrian etiquette software.&quot; This trains the robot to follow its leader at a safe distance and speed while proactively anticipating the movements of the people around them.  The mini&#39;s<em>&nbsp;</em>wheels are independently powered, enabling it to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-26-rivian-shows-off-how-its-new-evs-can-tank-turn.html">Rivian-esque zero-radius tank turns</a>, while a third motor is dedicated to maintaining the robot&#39;s balance when accelerating and braking.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Seeing the initial consumer response to Gita proved to us what a pioneer the product was within the consumer robotics industry,” said Greg Lynn, PFF’s CEO, said in a prepared statement. “The ask to ourselves then became, ‘how do we take what we have heard from people and create something different for a new segment of consumers?’’ Gitamini is the company&#39;s answer.</p><p>The Gitamini is slated to go on sale for $1,850 <a href="https://mygita.com/">on October 15th</a> while the original, larger Gita will see a price reduction to $2,950 at the same time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/this-robotic-backpack-follows-its-leader-wherever-you-may-wander-110030566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c2fc2d5-e3f9-4e5b-97f5-1b8d6434f980</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632326263</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T15:57:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a512c030-1b17-11ec-aad6-049c52ab2ba2" width="6582" height="4388" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a512c030-1b17-11ec-aad6-049c52ab2ba2" width="6582" height="4388" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Piaggio Fast Forward]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gitamini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GitaMini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Pokémon Unite' has arrived on Android and iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-unite-switch-mobile-release-date-143043996.html"><em>Pokémon Unite</em></a> is now available for download and is ready to play on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-unite/id1512321575">iOS</a>. It&#39;s the same free-to-start MOBA with the same maps and monsters the launched on the Nintendo Switch in July, though the <em>Pokémon Unite</em> team recently rolled out a new update in preparation for its mobile debut. In a <a href="https://unite.pokemon.com/en-us/news/producer-letter/">post</a> on the game&#39;s official website, producer Masaaki Hoshino detailed the new features, starting with full cross-platform support and account linking capability across mobile devices and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>The game has also introduced Unite Squads, which allow Trainers to team up with squadmates. According to The Pokémon Company, Trainers <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22685804/pokemon-unite-mobile-launch-ios-android-battle-pass-squads">can create</a> their own squads with this feature or search for existing ones. Teams will be able to use &quot;tags&quot; to describe themselves to give people with the same interests a way to find them. The update brings a second battle pass with all-new cosmetic items, new in-game events, new held items and support for more languages, as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hoshino has also mentioned in the post that the team is currently developing a new mode designed &quot;to level the playing field for all Trainers, regardless of their held items’ grades.&quot; While Hoshino didn&#39;t expound on the new mode, it could give people who don&#39;t spend a lot of money (if at all) to buy held items on the game a bigger chance to win against others who do.</p><div id="73244eabd2314b60b26bc30189bc618e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Get ready, Trainers!
