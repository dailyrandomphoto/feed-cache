The <a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1468777421243490312">Find N</a> looks like a device along the lines of Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Fold lineup, created after &quot;four years of intense R&amp;D and six generations of prototypes,&quot; Oppo said in a <a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-inno-day-2021-pete-letter-findn">press release</a>. The launch is set to take place at Oppo Inno Day on December 15th.&nbsp;</p><p>Oppo didn&#39;t reveal any processor, display or other specs of the Find N, other than showing an image and video. It did promise a &quot;beautiful&quot; device that feels good in the hand, and will be simple to use in both the open and closed positions. It also said that it has solved any screen creasing and durability issues inherent in folding smartphones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ae99c92d89934cf79338e1e558439392"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbyJXp_Cnu0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company best known for folding smartphones is Samsung, with both the Fold and Flip devices. It took Samsung three generations to work out major kinks in the Fold lineup, but the latest Fold 3 model &quot;still needs work,&quot; we said in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Engadget review</a>.

The latter will presumably succeed last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-093038483.html">Oppo AR Glass 2021</a>, developer-only Wayfarer-type glasses with 0.71-inch OLED panels meant to be connected to Android devices via a USB cable. It teased the new model with a &quot;light vs. light&quot; tagline, so they might be lightweight models aimed consumers, not just developers.

It was established in 1996 and became famous sometime ago for analyzing web traffic and listing the most popular websites around the world. The service also offers paid subscriptions for those who want detailed SEO analytics and insights. Now, Amazon has <a href="https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410503838999">announced</a> that it&#39;s retiring Alexa.com on May 1st, 2022, just a month after it celebrates its 26th anniversary.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, the company said:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Twenty-five years ago, we founded Alexa Internet.

Thank you for making us your go-to resource for content research, competitive analysis, keyword research, and so much more.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While Amazon didn&#39;t explicitly say why it&#39;s shutting down the service, Alexa Internet&#39;s traffic has been on the decline over the past decade based on data from Semrush, as <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/amazon-is-shutting-down-web-ranking-site-alexacom/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a> notes.

Amazon holds a position of &quot;absolute dominance&quot; in the Italian brokerage services market, &quot;which has allowed it to promote its own logistics service, called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA),&quot; the authority wrote in a (Google translated) press release.</p><p>According to the AGCM, companies must use Amazon&#39;s FBA service if they want access to key benefits like the Prime label, which in turn allows them to participate in Black Friday sales and other key events. &quot;Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,&quot; it said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The authority said access to those functions are &quot;crucial&quot; for seller success. It also noted that third-party sellers using FBA are not subject to the same stringent performance requirements as non-FBA sellers. As such, they&#39;re less likely to be suspended from the platform if they fail to meet certain goals. Finally, it noted that sellers using Amazon&#39;s logistics services are discouraged from offering their products on other online platforms, at least to the same extent they do on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p>The AGCM said it imposed the steep fine as it considered Amazon&#39;s actions to be &quot;particularly serious&quot; given  their duration and the effects they&#39;ve caused. On top of the fine, it has demanded that Amazon grant the privileges enjoyed by FBA sellers to all third-party sellers, provided they respect other rules and laws. It will have to define and publish those standards within a year, and its actions will be enforced by a monitoring trustee.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, an Amazon spokesperson said the company &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with the decision and will appeal. It also noted that non-FBA sellers can use its Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) service, which gives them access to Prime benefits without having to use Amazon’s logistics services.</p><blockquote><p>We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate. More than half of all annual sales on Amazon in Italy come from SMBs, and their success is at the heart of our business model. Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Last month, Amazon and Apple were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html">fined $228 million</a> in Italy for unfairly restricting Beats sales by limiting them to select retailers. The EU also handed Amazon a record <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fine-eu-data-privacy-130443268.html">$888 million fine</a> for violating the bloc&#39;s strict GDPR data privacy laws. Other tech giants are also under scrutiny in the EU.

First <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-04-nasa-ixpe-explorer-black-holes-cosmic-x-rays.html">announced</a> in 2017, the IXPE is the first satellite capable of measuring the polarization of X-rays that come from cosmic sources, such as black holes and neutron stars.&nbsp;</p><p>The fridge-sized satellite has three telescopes that can track and measure the direction, arrival time, energy, and polarization of light. When data from all those telescopes is combined, NASA can form images that could give us more insight into how mysterious celestial objects — those that emit X-ray — work. For instance, they&#39;re hoping it can give us a more thorough look at the structure of the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant with a neutron star rapidly spinning in its center.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By observing black holes, the IXPE will help scientists gain more insight and broaden humanity&#39;s knowledge on the regions of space we still barely know. It could provide clues on why they spin and how they gobble up cosmic materials, though it could also lead to new discoveries. Martin Weisskopf, the mission&#39;s principal investigator, said during a briefing: &quot;IXPE will help us test and refine our current theories of how the universe works. We may even discover more exciting theories about these exotic objects than what we&#39;ve hypothesized.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>SpaceX used a Falcon 9 rocket from a previous mission for this launch.

Unfortunately for Mosseri, members of the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security came to the hearing armed with fresh anecdotes from their own finstas.</p><p>During the hearing, Mosseri’s first time appearing in Congress, multiple senators revealed that they and their staffs had created fresh Instagram accounts disguised as teenagers. They all said that the app had steered them toward content that was inappropriate for young users, including “anorexia coaches,” and other content related to self harm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The staff of one lawmaker, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, managed to uncover a significant bug in one of Instagram&#39;s teen safety features. Blackburn said that her staff created a fresh account as a 15-year old-girl, but that the account defaulted to public, not private. Instagram said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html"><ins>in July</ins></a> that teens younger than 16 signing up for the first time would be defaulted to private accounts.</p><p>“While Instagram is touting all these safety measures, they aren&#39;t even making sure that the safety measures are in effect for me,” Blackburn said. Mosseri later confirmed that the company had mistakenly not enabled the private default settings for new accounts created on the web. “We will correct that quickly,” he said.</p><p>Blackburn wasn’t the only senator who came to the hearing prepared with questions about what they saw on a staff-created finsta. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said that his staff had created a new account posing as 13-year-old just days before. He said after following “a few accounts promoting eating disorders,” that “within an hour, all of our recommendations promoted pro-anorexia and eating disorder content.” He later added that a search for self harm content turned up results so graphic he didn’t feel he could describe them.</p><p>It was a notable shift from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html"><ins>cringeworthy moment</ins></a> at a September hearing, when Blumenthal clumsily pushed Facebook’s Head of Safety, Antigone Davis, on whether she could “commit to ending finsta.” This time, Blumenthal pressed Mosseri on whether he would commit to ending work on Instagram Kids entirely — Mosseri did not — and whether he would make more data about Instagram’s algorithms available to researchers outside the company.</p><p>“I can commit to you today that we will provide meaningful access to data so that third party researchers can design their own studies and make their own conclusions about the effects of well being on young people,” Mosseri said. He later added that Instagram is working on giving users the option for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-bring-back-a-chronological-feed-in-2022-211232214.html">chronological feed</a>.</p><p>Utah Senator Mike Lee also shared his experience creating an Instagram account for a fictitious 13-year-old girl. He described how the recommendations in the account’s Explore page changed after following just one account. “The Explore page yielded fairly benign results at first,” he said. “We followed the first account that was recommended by Instagram, which happened to be a very famous female celebrity. After following that account, we went back to the Explore page and the content quickly changed.</p><p>“Why did following Instagrams top recommended account for a 13-year-old girl cause our Explore page to go from showing really innocuous things, like hairstyling videos, to content that promotes body dysmorphia. sexualization of women and content otherwise unsuitable for a 13 year old girl?”</p><p>Mosseri replied that, according to the company’s Community Standards Enforcement report, content promoting eating disorders accounts for “roughly five out of every 10,000 things viewed.” Lee didn’t buy it. “It went dark fast,” he said. “It was not five in 1,000 or five in 10,000, it was rampant.”</p><p>While much of what the senators described was similar to what journalists and others have reported experiencing on Instagram, the exchanges were telling because they underscored a point that’s been raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen and others studying the company: That Facebook often uses <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/"><ins>deceptive statistics</ins></a> to mask its problems. And that the sheer size of the platform means that even relatively low amounts of harmful content can have an outsize impact on users.&nbsp;</p><p>It also indicated just how seriously lawmakers are taking the issue of teen safety and social media. While previous hearings with big tech executives have often veered wildly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">off topic</a>, senators stayed relatively focused on the issues. And it was clear that there was bipartisan agreement on the need for Instagram to disclose more information about its platform to the public and to researchers.</p><p>“I would support federal legislation around the transparency of data, or the access to data from researchers, and around the prevalence of content problems on the platform,” Mosseri said. But Blumenthal pushed back, saying Instagram’s previous actions haven’t gone far enough.</p><p>“​​The kinds of baby steps that you&#39;ve suggested so far, very respectfully, are underwhelming,” Blumenthal said at the close of the hearing. “I think you will sense on this committee, pretty strong determination to do something well beyond what you&#39;ve indicated you have in mind. That&#39;s the reason that I think self-policing based on trust is no longer a viable solution.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92bc844d-10b4-4272-9e97-eaf8b0fa8e78</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:17:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639009072</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T00:18:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - DECEMBER 08: Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testifies at a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security Subcommittee hearing on "Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users" on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., United States on December 08, 2021.

Per <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reading-rainbow-live-returns/"><em><ins>CBS News</ins></em></a>, this latest version of the classic children’s show will be known as <em>Reading Rainbow Live</em>. It will feature an interactive component that kids will be able to access through <a href="https://www.loopedlive.com/"><ins>Looped</ins></a>. The platform will allow viewers to ask questions of the cast, and participate in games. Naturally, <em>Reading Rainbow Live</em> will also be available to stream online.</p><p>The original debuted in 1983 and was famously hosted by LeVar Burton. The <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation </em>actor won’t be involved in the new project, at least not as a host. Instead, a cast of “Rainbows” will share that duty. What won’t change is the format of the show. As before, each episode will be about 25 minutes and will try to teach audiences through music, field trips, cultural experiences and the book of the day of course.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Creative Director Amy Guglielmo told <em>CBS News </em>the new show is partly a response to the pandemic. “We know it was a tough pandemic for parents, for caregivers, for teachers,” she said. “We wanted to make sure that we have kids engaging with books and we’re going to use movement and music to engage kids in learning.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reading-rainbow-live-2022-230711237.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9e44109-bb7c-4242-91a4-0810867baf23</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 23:07:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639004835</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T23:07:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/40efecd0-587b-11ec-afee-c58a3e2591fa" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/40efecd0-587b-11ec-afee-c58a3e2591fa" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reading Rainbow]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Reading Rainbow]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has a secret system for dealing with attacks on high-profile accounts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/twitters-main-character">the meme goes</a>, the goal of every Twitter user is to avoid being the main character of the day. But if you end up being that unlucky soul, it turns out Twitter is prepared to help you survive the potential trolling onslaught. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/twitter-s-highest-profile-users-get-vip-treatment-when-trolls-strike"><em>Bloomberg reports</em></a>, the company has developed Project Guardian, an internal list of thousands of accounts who could potentially be attacked by other users. Being on that list fast-tracks any complaints related to those users on Twitter&#39;s moderation systems.</p><p>While it may sound a bit suspect, the big takeaway from <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> reporting is that Project Guardian is just a predictive aspect of Twitter&#39;s security measures. And unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html">Facebook&#39;s treatment of VIP&#39;s</a>, which has been criticized for allowing celebrities and politicians to break that platform&#39;s rules, Twitter&#39;s system doesn&#39;t  necessarily grant more privileges to users.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Project Guardian also includes some well-known athletes, media personalities and politicians, but Yoel Roth, Twitter&#39;s head of site integrity, tells <em>Bloomberg</em> that the list doesn&#39;t include famous users. As, as we mentioned, it also helps to protect normal people who end up going viral.</p><p>“The reason this concept existed is because of the ‘person of the day’ phenomenon,” Roth said. “And on that basis, there are some people who are the ‘person of the day’ most days, and so Project Guardian would be one way to protect them.”</p><p>In an ideal world, Twitter would be able to give every user the same amount of security support. But, as <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, the company currently receives too many moderation requests to manage that. Perhaps that&#39;s an argument that user safety should be scaled in proportion with user growth. And while Project Guardian helps to protect some users, it&#39;s also a smart way for Twitter to squash harassment that could also hurt its own image. You could argue that&#39;s true for practically every security measure a social media company takes, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-project-guardian-vip-safety-220809710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff63f14e-c6c5-4444-bc1d-54b09cb4bc48</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 22:08:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639001291</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T22:08:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 14, 2021.

The organization, which is a coalition of labor unions, analyzed more than 130,000 search results and found that about 28 percent of the results you see on Amazon represent ads. What’s more, SOC says those ads don’t comply with FTC guidelines designed to make it possible for consumers to distinguish between sponsored content and organic search results.</p><p>In 2013, the agency <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-search-engine-industryon-need-distinguish/130625searchenginegeneralletter.pdf"><ins>said</ins></a> companies should feature prominent shading or borders, in addition to clear text that is properly situated and sized to avoid confusion. SOC found that zero percent of Amazon’s advertisements featured prominent shading and only about 1.1 percent had an easily distinguished border. When it came to the company’s use of “sponsored” labels, SOC found that in about 22 percent of ads the disclosure was buried under more prominent labels, such as ones that said “Highly rated” and “Today’s deals.” Additionally, those disclosures used a font that was smaller and lighter than the ones the company employed to advertise if a product was liked by other customers or part of a deal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, SOC claims Amazon employs a technique called “lazy loading” where sponsored labels take longer to appear, particularly on slower internet connections. Using a 12 to 25Mbps connection, the organization found those labels could take up to three seconds longer to load than the top banner ad. We’ll note here we had difficulty verifying that claim at Engadget.</p><p>SOC has asked the FTC to take “aggressive and swift action” against the company. &quot;Amazon’s violations are so omnipresent that Amazon’s representation that its platform presents ‘search results’ to consumers is itself deceptive,&quot; it said.</p><p>Amazon disputes SOC&#39;s findings. “This report is incorrect and misunderstands FTC guidance – ads in Amazon’s store always include a clear and prominent ‘sponsored’ label, implemented in accordance with FTC guidelines,” an Amazon spokesperson told Engadget. “We design our store to help customers discover products we think may best meet their needs – sponsored ads is one of the ways to help them find products they may be interested in.”</p><p>It’s hard to say if the FTC will take up SOC’s complaint against Amazon. And, even if it does, what kind of action it could take against the company. Part of the problem here is that the agency’s own guidelines leave some room open for interpretation.</p><p>“We understand that there is not any one specific method for clearly and prominently distinguishing advertising from natural search results, and that search engines may develop new methods for distinguishing advertising results,” the FTC said in 2013. “Any method may be used, so long as it is noticeable and understandable to consumers.”</p><p>At the same time, this is exactly the kind of issue the agency is likely willing to take up under recently appointed chair <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html"><ins>Lina Khan</ins></a>. In 2017, Khan, then a student at Yale Law School, published an article titled “<a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Antitrust Paradox</ins></a>” in which she argued current US policies and laws weren’t enough to keep companies like Amazon accountable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soc-ftc-amazon-complaint-220745342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">955117b1-cf95-48d7-9fe1-6b0948c38449</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 22:07:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639000676</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T21:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3be54ca0-586f-11ec-bffe-ca4c77dfad91" width="4989" height="3325" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3be54ca0-586f-11ec-bffe-ca4c77dfad91" width="4989" height="3325" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gonzalo Fuentes / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of Amazon is seen at the company's logistics center in Bretigny-sur-Orge, near Paris, France, December 7, 2021.

President Biden has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/12/08/executive-order-on-catalyzing-clean-energy-industries-and-jobs-through-federal-sustainability/">issued</a> an executive order that would require the government to stop buying combustion engine vehicles by 2035, and to switch all buildings to renewables and other zero-carbon energy sources by 2050. The administration willbuy only carbon-free electricity by 2030, and aims to cut building emissions in half by 2032.</p><p>Biden saw the measure as a way to &quot;lead by example&quot; and encourage both a &quot;carbon pollution-free&quot; electricity industry by 2035 and net zero emissions for the entire economy by 2050. The federal government is the largest employer, energy user and land owner in the US, the President said, and its shift to renewables could influence private businesses.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a modest goal in some ways. The timeline is very long, for a start. Multiple states will have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-york-law-ban-gas-powered-car-sales-2035-053554406.html">banned gas-powered car sales</a> by 2035 — why would it take the federal government that long to switch a relatively modest 600,000-vehicle fleet to EVs and other emissions-free machines? The 300,000 buildings are more daunting, but the order gives officials roughly three decades to make the transition.</p><p>At the same time, there are plenty of challenges. The feds depend on a wide range of buildings and vehicles across the country, many of them with different requirements. It may take a highly coordinated effort to transition everything to zero-emissions transport and renewable energy, even if the scale is relatively modest. And then there&#39;s the question of future administrations. As we&#39;ve seen before, a new presidency can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-03-trump-epa-dot-fuel-emissions-proposal.html">undo environmental regulations</a> and delay or even thwart emissions reduction plans. The targets offer plenty of opportunities for reversals.</p><p>The order is still notable even if there are setbacks. It&#39;s an acknowledgment that efforts to limit climate change aren&#39;t confined to the private sector, and it could prompt contractors to transition to environmentally friendly products in a bid to win federal deals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-federal-building-vehicle-renewable-energy-order-215237418.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">58301b6c-ff75-450d-876e-2a9ccce0294c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 21:52:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639000989</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T22:03:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2043a570-5868-11ec-bbdf-93cc2c968f98" width="2880" height="1920" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2043a570-5868-11ec-bbdf-93cc2c968f98" width="2880" height="1920" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MANDEL NGAN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GMC Hummer EVs are seen behind President Joe Biden as he speaks during a visit to the General Motors Factory ZERO electric vehicle assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan on November 17, 2021.

Christine works for Blizzard, the group responsible for games including Overwatch and Diablo, and she stood outside the studio&#39;s headquarters in Irvine, California, with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, by her side.&nbsp;</p><p>Through tears, Christine said she experienced years of sexual harassment at Blizzard, even though it had started out as her &quot;dream job.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;I was so excited to be a part of a community that seemed to care so much about their employees,&quot; Christine said. &quot;Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t happen to me. Since I&#39;ve been employed at Blizzard, I&#39;ve been subjected to rude comments about my body, unwanted sexual advances, inappropriately touched, subjected to alcohol-infused team events and cube crawls, invited to have casual sex with my supervisors, and surrounded by a frat-boy culture that&#39;s detrimental to women.&quot;</p><p>Christine said she brought these negative experiences to her supervisors and they were brushed aside. According to her statement, her superiors said the men harassing her were &quot;just joking&quot; and that she should &quot;get over it.&quot; She was told not to go to HR. She was told her abusers had done nothing wrong in the eyes of the law.</p><p>Christine said that after she complained about the sexual abuse she was experiencing, she was demoted and faced retaliation. She said she was denied shares in the company and full profit-sharing, and she received minimal raises.</p><p>In her statement, Christine said her mental health was shattered by these events, but she was going public in order to fight for a safe work environment for all Activision Blizzard employees.</p><p>&quot;Blizzard has some amazing people that work for them, but we need to feel safe and supported by people in leadership roles, and hold people accountable for their actions,&quot; she said.</p><p>Activision Blizzard is facing multiple investigations and lawsuits regarding its alleged frat-boy culture. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is suing the studio after an investigation uncovered years of discriminatory hiring practices, a systemic failure to treat sexual harassment seriously, and a culture that encouraged abuse. The result, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">according to the DFEH report</a>, was a studio where just 20 percent of employees were women, and leadership roles were held only by white men.</p><div id="59bef0775e084ab1be8831373bb64b6a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/we5QWDLHwXE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Lisa Bloom, Christine&#39;s lawyer, made a statement of her own after the employee spoke.</p><p>&quot;We are here because sexual harassment victims at Activision Blizzard have been ignored,&quot; Bloom said. &quot;They are still suffering and it&#39;s time that they are prioritized.&quot;</p><p>Following an investigation by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this year, Activision Blizzard was ordered to establish an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">$18 million fund</a> to compensate victims of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the studio. Bloom argued that this amount is far too low, considering there are hundreds of victims. She also pointed out that Activision Blizzard has already missed critical deadlines when it comes to distributing this money.</p><p>&quot;I think we can all agree that the $18 million number is woefully inadequate,&quot; Bloom said.</p><p>Bloom then outlined three demands. She first said Activision Blizzard should establish a streamlined, fair and fast process for all victims to resolve their legal claims, and asked for a fund exceeding $100 million.

Speaking to lawmakers at a Senate hearing on Instagram and teen safety, Mosseri said that he supports “giving people the option to have a chronological feed.”</p><p>“We&#39;re currently working on a version of a chronological feed that we hope to launch next year,” Mosseri said, adding that the company has been working on the feature “for months.” He didn’t share additional details about how such a feed would work, but said that the company is “targeting the first quarter of next year” for a launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Launching an option for a chronological feed would be a major reversal for the photo sharing app, which has consistently defended its algorithmic feed despite persistent complaints and conspiracy theories from users about how their posts are ranked. In <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works">a blog post</a> in June, Mosseri wrote that a chronological feed made it “impossible for most people to see everything, let alone all the posts they cared about.” He said the chronological feed resulted in people “missing” a majority of the posts in their feed in 2016.</p><p>Since then, Instagram has faced even more scrutiny over how its algorithms rank and suggest content, particularly for teenagers and younger users.

Developer and reverse engineer Alessandro Paluzzi also <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1454216612358377477">recently spotted</a> a feature that would allow users to sort their feeds by “home,” “favorites” or &quot;following,&quot; though it’s not clear if any of those refer to a chronological feed.

And then there&#39;s Daniele Pucci, head of the Artificial and Mechanical Intelligence lab at the Italian Institute of Technology, who has taken the audacious step of strapping a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gravity-industries-jet-suit-test-impressions-future-lab-festival-of-speed-160009551.html">fully functional jetpack</a> akin to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-taking-on-gravity-richard-browning-penguin-random-house-uk-153026035.html">what Richard Browning developed</a> onto the back of an iRonCub synthetic humanoid with hopes of eventually <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-humanoid-robot">blasting it into the sky</a>.</p><div id="45e54b4708994a829af00f8ac2fbc960"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NShdgh16Yuk?rel=0&amp;start=1" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>You&#39;d think we&#39;d have learned our lesson about the dangers of building aerial humanoid robots after our first time through <em>Age of Ultron </em>but Pucci&#39;s team believes that such systems could one day act as first responders to the roughly 300 natural disasters that kill around 90,000 people worldwide annually. We&#39;ve seen a slew of disaster response bots — some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">humanoid</a>, some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html">not so much</a> — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-19-darpas-insect-sized-shrimp-robots-disaster-relief.html">emerge from labs</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-04-researchers-develop-flying-wifi-robots-for-disaster-relief.html">more than a decade</a>, often with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">varying degrees of success</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c6024084680b4162becaa7ba0e696be6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0TaYhjpOfo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Humanoid robots have an advantage over both more esoteric builds and traditional UAVs when it comes to disaster response because they can more easily manipulate a world, which is already designed for human use. However when a natural disaster strikes, much of that human-centric infrastructure could become damaged or otherwise rendered impassable, which negates many of the humanoid robot&#39;s initial advantages. But by combining a humanoid design with the capability of flight, Pucci&#39;s team can leverage the best aspects of both technologies.</p><p>&quot;Aerial Humanoid Robotics unifies aerial manipulation and humanoid robotics. By doing so, aerial humanoid robots overcome the lack of terrestrial locomotion of aerial manipulators and extend the locomotion capabilities of humanoid robots to the flight case. Aerial humanoid robots can then walk, fly, manipulate and transport objects, thus offering energetically efficient solutions to payload transportation and object manipulation,&quot; <a href="https://ieee-aerialrobotics-uavs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ICRA2019_AerialRoboticsWorkshop_paper_Pucci.pdf">the IIT team wrote in 2019</a>.</p><div id="a7403dcb4b4d4d9c99810a3984a39a5f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBEYEF0g4WY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>&quot;Aerial humanoid robotics extends aerial manipulation to a more robust and energy efficient level. In fact, aerial manipulation is often exemplified by quadrotors equipped with a robotic arm,&quot; Pucci told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-humanoid-robot"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a><em>.</em> &quot;These robots can’t move around by means of contact forces with the environment, and they often struggle with flying in windy environments while manipulating an object, requiring precise position control for accomplishing manipulation tasks. So the extra hand of a flying humanoid robot could establish a contact point between the robot and the environment, thus making the robot position control simpler and more robust.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I truly believe that aerial humanoid robotics can be used as a test-bed for actuated flying exoskeletons for human beings,&quot; he continued. &quot;The recent successful story of Richard Browning shows the engineering feasibility of these futuristic actuated exoskeletons. However, the journey in front of us is still long, and we can use flying humanoid robots to boost this journey and avoid lots of tests on humans.&quot;</p><p>Pucci&#39;s most recent study, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9622189"><em>Momentum-Based Extended Kalman Filter for Thrust Estimation on Flying Multibody Robots</em></a>, is slated for publication in the January issue of <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/italian-researchers-have-built-a-humanoid-robot-that-may-one-day-fly-like-iron-man-192750759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a44e215-1a15-4ca1-b2b8-dfd61b153f82</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:27:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638993555</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:59:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60c3d330-585a-11ec-b7fe-107d7a4abd05" width="1580" height="1185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/43792c60-5852-11ec-86f9-ce870507a0c0" width="2880" height="1576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instituto Italiano di Technologia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Horizon Zero Dawn' now supports NVIDIA and AMD upscaling on PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Guerrilla Games has rolled out the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Horizon%20Zero%20Dawn/"><em><ins>Horizon Zero Dawn</ins></em></a> update on PC, which should improve the game&#39;s performance.

While that feature didn’t quite make the release of those two updates, it’s now available at six Hyatt locations across the US. As you might expect, it allows you to store a digital version of your hotel keycard in Apple Wallet.</p><p>You can add the keycard at any point after you reserve a room. However, you’ll still need to check in at the front desk before you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to enter your guestroom or any other restricted area within the hotel. The digital keycards support Apple Wallet’s Express Mode feature, which means you don’t need to authenticate your identity with Face ID or Touch ID every time you want to use the feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If at any point you decide to extend your stay or change rooms, the hotel can update your keycard without the need for you to visit the front desk. What’s more, if your device starts running low on battery life and enters Power Reserve mode, you can still use your iPhone or Apple Watch as a keycard for up to five hours.</p><p>The six locations where you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to store a keycard are as follows: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p><p>Hyatt says it expects to roll out the technology to all of its locations globally. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-digital-id-delay-195046762.html">Sometime next year</a>, Apple also plans to allow iOS 15 and watchOS 8 to store government issued IDs from select states as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-hotel-keycards-hyatt-launch-190013202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cf0798a-0b23-4144-aec8-c82207f5eeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638992106</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:35:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyatt Hotels Corporation]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ford Bronco Sport contains trace amounts of recycled ocean plastic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many car brands are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">touting recycled parts</a> in their vehicles, but Ford thinks it can claim some extra bragging rights.

At the same time, it shows just how far Ford has to go.

Ford has vowed to further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html">electrify its lineup</a> and explore future uses of ocean plastic.

If a component is listed as an &quot;unknown part,&quot; it&#39;s either unofficial, an already-used part from another iPhone or malfunctioning.</p><p>Just how much you&#39;ll learn depends on your iPhone model.

It&#39;s not yet clear if iPad owners will see a corresponding part history feature at some point.</p><p>The &quot;unknown part&quot; label might not thrill advocates for third-party component options. Apple clearly wants you to use official parts, and that means either taking it in for authorized service or (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">in 2022</a>) buying parts from Apple. This might help you catch shops lying about the quality of their parts, though, and could be useful if you repair an iPhone yourself and want to be sure your fixes went smoothly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df0c8187-af16-4774-ae0b-b8cb86e61af3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638985550</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:46:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GTA Online's next big update features Dr. Dre and Franklin from 'GTA V']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rockstar%20games/">Rockstar Games</a> will soon release another big update for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gta%20online/"><em><ins>GTA Online</ins></em></a>, which includes a story mission featuring one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/GTA%20V/"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto V</ins></em><ins>&#39;s</ins></a> main characters. &quot;The Contract&quot; centers around Franklin Clinton and his friends, who aspire to be problem solvers for celebrities and &quot;rich folk who got rich folk problems.&quot;</p><p>One of those potential clients is Dr. Dre, who appears as himself in the story.

The tool essentially simulates what a conversation like that may look like with the help of AI chatbots. At launch, the CCS came with access to one such “persona.” Today, The Trevor Project is <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/the-trevor-project-expands-its-ai-innovation-with-new-crisis-contact-simulator-persona-to-scale-counselor-training/">adding a second one called Drew</a>. The new chatbot represents a fictional youth in their early 20s who lives in California and faces bullying and harassment.</p><p>Since implementing its first persona, the aptly named Trevor, in February, the organization says the technology has helped train more than 1,000 counselors. One thing to note here is The Trevor Project is using the Crisis Contact Simulator to complement its existing training methods; the tool is not a replacement for in-person training. It allows new applicants to complete two roleplay sessions at a time that works best for them. It also claims the chatbots offer an accurate representation of today’s Gen Z youth, complete with “realistic” capitalization and punctuation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Starting from the first conception of the Crisis Contact Simulator two years ago, it has always been our hope to develop a variety of training roleplay personas that represent the diverse experiences and intersectional identities of the LGBTQ young people we serve, each with their own stories and feelings,” said Dan Fichter, The Trevor Project’s head of AI and engineering. “We’re excited to deploy Drew with our trainees to offer a wider variety of practice scenarios and narratives, which will better prepare them to connect with any young person in a moment of crisis when the time comes.”</p><p>The Trevor Project is no stranger to the tech world.

To shorten that response time, at least to a matter of weeks rather than months, Meta’s AI research group (formerly FAIR) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14690.pdf">has developed a more generalized technology</a> that requires just a handful of specific examples in order to respond to new and emerging forms of malicious content, called Few-Shot Learner (FSL).</p><p>Few-shot learning is a relatively recent development in AI, essentially teaching the system to make accurate predictions based on a limited number of training examples — quite the opposite of conventional supervised learning methods. For example, if you wanted to train a standard SL model to recognize pictures of rabbits, you feed it a couple hundred thousand rabbit pictures and then you can present it with two images and ask if they both show the same animal. Thing is, the model doesn’t know if the two pictures are of rabbits because it doesn’t actually know what a rabbit is. That’s because the model’s purpose isn’t to spot rabbits, the model’s purpose is to look for similarities and differences between the presented images and predict whether or not the things displayed are the same. There is no larger context for the model to work within, which makes it only good for telling “rabbits” apart — it can’t tell you if it’s looking at an image of a rabbit, or of a lion, or of a John Cougar Mellencamp, just that those three entities are not the same thing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="63d90029fa404788975f4678c771df7f"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0fJyXvO" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>FSL relies far less on labelled data (i.e. pictures of rabbits) in favor of a generalized system, more akin to how humans learn than conventional AIs. “It’s first trained on billions of generic and open-source language examples,” per a Wednesday Meta blog post. “Then, the AI system is trained with <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__transparency.fb.com_features_approach-2Dto-2Dranking_content-2Ddistribution-2Dguidelines_content-2Dborderline-2Dto-2Dthe-2Dcommunity-2Dstandards_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=nq7G5BV3pUJKzCGIu8cu5_tCus3U1C00PIx5p0WG07A&amp;m=W_gGKUlJZmdjHRDSGJwMk1WvQKkih20AvL1uv-AHrdA&amp;s=iykgbeuxOzQP-V5xTgniBEzjaSAwPNs4WBMZ4LIur3M&amp;e=">integrity-specific data</a> we’ve labeled over the years. Finally, it’s trained on condensed text explaining a new policy.” And unlike the rabbit-matching model above, FSL “is pretrained on both general language and integrity-specific language so it can learn the policy text implicitly.”</p><p>Recent tests of the FSL system have proven encouraging. Meta researchers looked at the change in prevalence of harmful content shown to Facebook and Instagram users before and after FSL’s activation on the sites. The system both found harmful content that conventional SL models had missed and reduced the prevalence of that content in general. The FSL system reportedly outperformed other few-shot models by as much as 55 percent (though only 12 percent on average).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/969af200-57a5-11ec-9f2f-58cccf12ef42" alt="FSL Prevalence Graph the numbers are going down" data-uuid="d2f3768b-8bcd-39f2-9c32-95084353d122"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>FSL’s improved performance is thanks in part to entailment, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entailment#:~:text=noun,an%20entailment%20of%20the%20job.">defined as</a> “the act or fact of entailing, or involving by necessity or as a consequence.” It’s essentially a logical consequence between two sentences — if sentence A is true, then sentence B must also be true. For example, if sentence A is “The President was assassinated,” then it entails that sentence B, “the President is dead,” is also true, accurate and correct. By leveraging entailment in the FSL system, the team is able to “convert the class label into a natural language sentence which can be used to describe the label, and determine if the example entails the label description,” Meta AI researchers explained. So instead of trying to generalize what a conventional SL model knows from its training set (hundreds of thousands of rabbit pics) to the test set (“are these two images of rabbits?”), the FSL model can more broadly recognize harmful content when it sees it, because it understands the policy that the content violates.</p><p>The added flexibility of having a “single, shared knowledge base and backbone” could one day enable AI moderation systems to recognize and react to new forms of harmful content far more quickly, catch more content that just barely skirts around current policies and even help Meta develop and better define future policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-prototype-moderation-ai-only-needs-a-few-examples-of-bad-behavior-to-take-action-170005410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ae0fcc97-8149-4a28-9d2c-f39045d7e3fc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638983854</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:17:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A 3D printed Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta and Facebook logo are seen in this illustration taken on November 2, 2021.

The smart speaker firm has <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/newsroom/sonos-sustainability">unveiled</a> an inaugural climate plan that will make its &quot;value chain&quot; carbon neutral by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

Fiscal 2023 will also mark the release of Sonos&#39; first devices designed explicitly with recycling and reuse in mind, such as easier-to-remove fasteners in place of glue.

From security cameras to smart light bulbs, pretty much any internet-connected device that you can control via an app is enough to get you started on your smart home journey. But before you dive in, we advise taking a few preliminary steps. For one, don’t try to outfit your entire smart home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. From there, you can figure out if you want to buy more devices, making sure that they’re compatible with one another. Below are our suggestions for the best of each smart device category, with alternate suggestions where appropriate.</p><h2>Before you start, pick a voice assistant</h2><p>While plenty of smart home devices are platform agnostic, there are some — smart speakers and smart displays in particular — that require you to choose your voice assistant. Currently, that means deciding if you’ll use the Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa on a regular basis. (I’ll address Siri in a moment.) They’re both compatible with various smart home products from light bulbs to robot vacuums, but there are certain devices that work best with either Google or Amazon. Nest products, for example, are more compatible with Google-powered speakers and displays. They can still work with Amazon devices, but certain features might be disabled. The same holds true with Amazon products: They work better if they’re in the same ecosystem.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how do you choose between Alexa and Google Assistant? It really depends on your personal preferences. Do you listen to Audible, watch Prime Video and tend to do a lot of shopping on Amazon? Then you might lean toward an Alexa-powered product. Do you use a lot of Google services like YouTube and Google Podcasts? A Google-powered device might be best.</p><p>If you want a voice assistant that’s great at answering questions, Google Assistant tends to be better than Alexa. Amazon’s helper, on the other hand, currently supports more smart home products. The company’s smart speakers and displays also support the Zigbee smart home protocol, and some devices even have built-in smart home hubs. Both Google and Amazon devices can sync with your calendar, though Google’s tend to work better with Google services. Plus, if you already have an Android phone, you might be more comfortable with Google Assistant anyway.</p><p>But what about Siri? Apple’s assistant is an option as well, but it doesn’t have the same level of device support as Google and Amazon. The HomePod mini and the (now discontinued) HomePod are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market at the moment, too. That said, it’s not too hard to find HomeKit-compatible gear as more third-party companies add support for it, but you currently have a smaller pool of devices to choose from.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best smart speaker: Sonos One</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/914b9040-7a8c-11ea-9ee7-aa6c14e6afb5" alt="Sonos One smart speaker." data-uuid="77872500-1368-45aa-9f4c-36cc0673f1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham</div></figure><p>Our recommendation for the best smart speaker is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos One" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla">Sonos One</a>. It’s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that’s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room — which requires the iOS app — the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn’t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it’s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It’s also compatible with a slew of  streaming services, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it’s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time. It’s also convenient if you plan on building a home theater setup later on, as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-18-sonos-one-review.html">One</a> integrates well with Sonos soundbars.

Out of the three, we think the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo" href="https://amzn.to/3FdU1zQ">Echo</a> has the best audio quality. Our colleague Nate Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-review-130046336.html">said</a> its bass is impressive and the mid-range frequencies are pretty powerful.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, on the other hand, is perfectly sized for most rooms in the house. Like other Alexa-powered smart displays, it supports plenty of video streaming services including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix and it comes with a couple of built-in browsers that you can use to surf the web. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support YouTube, which is a pretty notable omission considering how ubiquitous the service is. As a workaround, you can access it via the aforementioned browsers, but the experience isn’t as smooth as if it were a native app.</p><p>You can use the Show 8 to make video calls with any phone or tablet with the Alexa app. Alternatively, it supports Skype, Zoom and Amazon’s own Chime service.

It has a 7-inch screen, which makes it just big enough to fit in most rooms in the house. The size also makes it work well as a digital photo frame. You can set it up to pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and there’s a smart algorithm that automatically uses the best shots while avoiding the blurry ones. As you might expect, you can also use the display to watch YouTube, Netflix and other streaming services.</p><p>Plus, a smart display without a camera is great if you want to place it in more intimate places like the bedroom, where you might be more protective of your privacy.

Its built-in camera can be used for video calls with Google Duo, Google Meet and Zoom. It also has an optional face-tracking feature that lets the camera follow you around during calls. One benefit of the camera is that it gives you the option for Face Match, a feature that automatically recognizes individual members of the house and then displays the information that’s pertinent only to them, like calendar alerts.</p><p>Additionally, the camera adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen, which is convenient if you need to stop the music without having to shout across the room.

Smart light bulbs let you control your lighting remotely, either via an app and with your voice. They add automation and scheduling to the mix, so you can have them turn on and off at certain times of the day. Some also let you adjust their brightness and color temperature, or even let you create a custom light scene.</p><p>Our favorite smart lighting products come from Philips Hue, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6">White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit</a> is a particularly good entry point as it includes three Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 60W LED smart bulbs; a Hue hub that lets you control up to 50 lights; and a Smart Button if you want to have the option of turning off the lights without having your phone around.</p><p>This kit offers lots of versatility in lighting styles; you can change not just the brightness but also the color temperature and experiment with all different shades of the rainbow, decking out your room in whatever light scene you desire. If that seems a little too daring, Philips offers alternatives: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3CeFthg">Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit</a> lacks the color option, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3wDkCmw">Hue White Starter Kit</a> won’t let you adjust the color temperature.</p><p>The main reason we prefer Philips Hue bulbs is that they’re widely supported across smart home ecosystems. Not only can you find them pretty much anywhere, but they’ll work with Google, Amazon and Apple’s HomeKit. Since all the bulbs connect to the Hue hub via the Zigbee protocol (and not your home’s WiFi), it tends to be more reliable and it won’t slow down your home internet connection either.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6" id="9fe2ec724416420ba4f7f91a1ba5627c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Philips Hue starter set at Best Buy - $130</a><h3>Best budget smart lights: Cync by GE</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49403500-582d-11ec-bef3-22d267ca3d71" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="GE Cync smart light bulbs" data-uuid="fa1de799-ca8a-35b7-9c23-8b292251791c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>If you’re not quite ready to dive into a whole lighting ecosystem or you just prefer a more affordable alternative, we suggest GE’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb" href="https://amzn.to/3C9FSlg">Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb</a>.

You can also customize Motion Detection Zones that allow you to adjust just how sensitive you want it to be. It also offers 24/7 continuous video recording that you can store via a 32GB microSD card (not included).</p><p>We especially like that the Wyze doesn’t require a subscription; free cloud storage is included with the purchase, and you’ll always have access to the last 14 days of recording on the app. Be warned, however, that the free account can only hold 12-second clips every five minutes. If you want it to record unlimited motion, consider upgrading to a Cam Plus subscription, which includes additional features like alerting you if it detects a person or a package.

There’s also two-way audio so you can talk to whoever’s at the door.</p><p>A highlight of this doorbell is that it comes with a three-month trial to Arlo’s Smart subscription service, which includes a motion detection feature that can tell the difference between a person, package, vehicle or animal.

(We liked the Shark Ion RV761, too, but the Roomba 694 is a newer model.) Plus, the app is really easy to use for luddites and the tech savvy alike. And just in case you don’t have access to the app — maybe you left your phone in another room, for example — the Roomba 694 has manual controls as well.</p><p>One of the reasons the Roomba 694 cleans so well is that it has a three-stage system that tells it to suck up dirt while also navigating around obstacles. When it encounters an especially filthy area, it focuses in on it, making sure it’s clean before moving on. You can also manually instruct it to clean a specific spot in case you need it.

It works with Google Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa, IFTTT plus Samsung SmartThings.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3n5diNr" id="25b564cadc584be1a01458c92a99e0f9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Kasa smart plug mini at Amazon - $10</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">859ce418-fe62-4a4f-956f-303be9e05a1f</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:45:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976997</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:23:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/6f4230f0-0be4-11eb-b3f6-db9714009fa4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/6f4230f0-0be4-11eb-b3f6-db9714009fa4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobt / 1996-2001 AccuSoft Co., All rights reserved]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 981 robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 981 robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Stadia is finally available on LG TVs almost one year later]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It took the better part of a year, but Google Stadia is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-stadia-cloud-gaming-now-on-latest-lg-smart-tvs-301439693.html">available</a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-oled-tv-game-optimizer-google-stadia-135907267.html">recent LG TVs</a>. Anyone with an LG set running webOS 5.0 or 6.0 (that is, 2020 or newer) can use the cloud gaming service to play <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> or <em>Madden</em> without requiring a media device or PC as a go-between. You&#39;ll need a compatible gamepad, but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue when the Stadia Controller and common console pads should work either wirelessly or through USB.</p><p>Not surprisingly, LG suggests one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html">OLED TVs</a> for Stadia thanks to the fast pixel response times, low latency and (for Stadia Pro subscribers) 4K HDR visuals. They&#39;re certainly not required, though, and it&#39;s arguably the lag from game streaming that will make the larger difference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stadia is available through the LG Content Store in all 22 countries where the service already exists. You probably won&#39;t buy a TV with Stadia in mind, but this significantly widens the number of sets where native support is an option — you might be more inclined to try it if the barrier to entry is that much lower.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-lg-smart-tv-release-date-152718368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64752abf-fae3-4f24-b1b0-f52414eb4087</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:27:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976469</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
