Liftoff is scheduled to take place at at 9:35 AM EDT (6:35 AM PDT) from the company‚Äôs launch site in West Texas. The flight&#39;s NS-17 mission title is a reference to its status as New Shepard&#39;s 17th launch. You can watch the proceedings live on the stream below. This time, there won&#39;t be any humans aboard, however. Instead, the reusable rocket and capsule will carry a payload of NASA tech including a LiDAR sensor and computer designed for lunar landers.&nbsp;</p><p>The launch comes amid a brewing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html">lawsuit </a>filed by Blue Origin over the space agency&#39;s handling of the Human Landing System program.

A new report claims a glitch in its secretive software program used by the FBI allowed unauthorized personnel to access private data for more than a year. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/"><em>The New York Post</em></a>, the mishap was revealed in a letter by prosecutors in the Manhattan federal court case against accused hacker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-01-crypto-expert-arrested-over-north-korea-sanctions.html">Virgil Griffith</a>. Palantir denied the claims in a statement and said the fault was caused by the FBI&#39;s incorrect use of the software.</p><p>Griffith was arrested in 2019 for allegedly providing North Korea with information on how cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could help it to evade US sanctions. The incident in question revolves around the alleged hacker&#39;s social media data, obtained through a federal search warrant in March 2020. According to the letter, the Twitter and Facebook information was uploaded to Palantir&#39;s program through the default settings, effectively allowing unauthorized FBI employees to access it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Between May 2020 to August 2021, the material was accessed four times by three analysts and an agent. The FBI case agent assigned to Griffith&#39;s case was alerted to the issue by a colleague earlier this month, according to the letter. Those who accessed the info reportedly told prosecutors that they did not recall using it in their investigations.</p><p>‚ÄúAn FBI analyst, in the course of conducting a separate investigation, had identified communications between the defendant and the subject of that other investigation by means of searches on the Platform that accessed the Search Warrant Returns,‚Äù the letter noted.</p><p>Palantir is trying to distance itself from the issue. &quot;There was no glitch in the software,&quot; it told <em>The New York Post</em> in a statement, adding that the &quot;customer&quot; did not follow the &quot;rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns.&quot;</p><p>Amid increasing growth, the last thing Palantir needs is a major PR crisis involving flaws in its software.

That certainly sounds like great news for users who&#39;ve been waiting for it after Google retired Play Music for Wear OS in 2020. The bad news is, as noted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/youtube-music-for-wear-os-hands-on/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, it only currently works on Google&#39;s Wear OS 3 platform.

And, based on what we know now, they may have to continue waiting, unless they&#39;re set to get Samsung&#39;s new smartwatches tomorrow.

But aside from that clever bit of wordplay, the title also carries a deeper meaning: That as much as we‚Äôd like to forget about the more embarrassing moments of the Star Trek franchise, they still happened and they weren‚Äôt all bad. Even, and especially, <em>Voyager</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/330ae480-05c9-11ec-acaa-bbf159c1d5d2" data-uuid="9b3711ed-3f9d-36ca-84e8-8916185ae74e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Viewer reactions to <em>Voyager</em> have been rather polarized over the course of the 26 years since it premiered. Back in the ‚Äò90s, many fans were excited to have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù Star Trek show again, one that took place on a ship that was constantly exploring, unlike the comparatively stationary political drama of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. But clunky writing soured many people‚Äôs opinion on <em>Voyager</em>, and toward the end of its run the show was known more for Seven of Nine‚Äôs skintight outfits and its slate of guest stars of the week, including Jason Alexander and Dwayne ‚ÄúThe Rock‚Äù Johnson.</p><p>After the show went off the air, the franchise stopped moving forward in its timeline, choosing to explore Starfleet‚Äôs founding in <em>Enterprise</em> and rebooting the entire universe completely with the 2009 Star Trek movie. While fans were thrown a bone with a brief cameo by Admiral Kathryn Janeway in the last <em>TNG</em>-era film, <em>Nemesis</em>, <em>Voyager</em> would essentially disappear from the Star Trek canon until the appearance of Seven of Nine in episode four of <em>Picard</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/85ead300-05c8-11ec-a73f-27b38dd4d507" data-uuid="e259426f-b4ab-3d61-9c56-1b9e35d74ee3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Trae Patton</div></figure><p>For fans of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Picard</em> had its upsides: We got to see Troi and Riker as a family, and Data got a better sendoff into the afterlife. But for fans of <em>Voyager</em>, it was anything but positive, with the death of a supporting character and a rather grim existence for fan-favorite Seven of Nine.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> rolls back the clock a little bit, as it takes place a year after the events of <em>Nemesis</em>, making it our first real view of the Star Trek universe‚Äôs immediate future after <em>TNG</em>, <em>DS9</em> and <em>Voyager</em>. The Dominion War is over, Romulus is under a new regime and the crew of the <em>USS Voyager</em> are basically celebrities after seven years spent in the Delta Quadrant; <em>Picard</em> takes place nearly twenty years later, when the luster would have been gone.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c6289830-05c8-11ec-ab6b-c3638ea0c8f3" data-uuid="660c1f35-3f18-3955-93ae-e716739fe980"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Matt Kennedy</div></figure><p>Here everything is just shiny and new and worthy of commemorative plates ‚Äî a bit of a weird thing to exist in a post-scarcity culture, but this is a comedy series, after all. And in this week‚Äôs B-plot, Brad Boimler is looking to get one of his plates signed by a special guest to the <em>USS Cerritos</em>: Tom Paris. Or, as Brad refers to the former Voyager crew member, ‚ÄúCreator of Fairhaven, Captain Proton himself‚Äù as well as the first human to break the transwarp barrier. Straight off, that‚Äôs a reference to three of the goofiest, oddball and some say worst episodes of <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>. And just in case you forgot what was so bad about the last one, Mariner asks ‚Äúis he still a salamander?,‚Äù because that is <em>a thing that happened </em>in the episode ‚ÄúThreshold.‚Äù</p><div id="0720ea20bac04daca218217ca6373404"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DBk2ejb6i8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Undeterred (and perhaps even encouraged) by the weirdness, Boimler is all hyped to meet his hero. Even after the ship‚Äôs system doesn‚Äôt recognize him and won‚Äôt let him through any doors, he takes to the Jefferies tubes to make his way to the bridge to meet Lt. Paris.</p><p>In a way, it feels like a metaphor for how the fandom feels about <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> now. While everyone admits it had a lot of dumb moments, those actually made it more<em>&nbsp;</em>endearing. The famous line ‚Äú<a href="https://youtu.be/mhyaBVmzWT8">there‚Äôs coffee in that nebula</a>‚Äù would inspire astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti to bring a replica uniform with her and wear it on a mission back in 2015:</p><div id="40d329226767429683df50cb1d7442ef"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;There&#39;s coffee in that nebula&quot;... ehm, I mean... in that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dragon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dragon</a>. <a href="http://t.co/9MYrqIOXnI">pic.twitter.com/9MYrqIOXnI</a></p>‚Äî Samantha Cristoforetti (@AstroSamantha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroSamantha/status/589035429879513088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2015</a></blockquote></div><p>And who can forget the infamous ‚ÄúTuvix‚Äù episode, where crew members Tuvok and Neelix were merged into one being thanks to a transporter accident?

It‚Äôs not as good as <em>TNG</em> or <em>DS9</em>, but it still has its fair share of fans. I remember a time when it seemed like it was constantly  running on Spike TV (now the Paramount Network), as opposed to <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, which is seldom rerun due to its serialized nature. Last year I sat down and rewatched the entire Star Trek franchise, including <em>Voyager</em>, and saw quite a few episodes I had missed the first time. I found myself enjoying some of it, cringing just as often, and eventually remembering why I had stopped watching the show for a while back when it aired. In general, I feel like the show‚Äôs biggest problem was missed potential, like the way the conflict between the Starfleet and Maquis crew members was quickly smoothed over, how it underutilized many of its cast, and why on earth did Harry Kim never get promoted.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aa800f00-05c8-11ec-8bdf-b8129d686be5" data-uuid="05acc3a9-4e63-30d4-b2e4-1bc23f7e6467"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, it‚Äôs not the job of <em>Lower Decks</em> to explain or redeem <em>Voyager</em>. Boimler and Tom Paris are only the B-plot here, with the main drive of the episode being Tendi and Mariner‚Äôs mission to pick up a package for Doctor T‚ÄôAna as well as Rutherford‚Äôs quest to find out how a certain dead officer is alive again. The episode just asks us to consider what it would be like to be a Starfleet officer and hear about all of <em>Voyager</em>‚Äôs adventures in the Delta Quadrant. Weird and goofy? Yes. But honestly, they‚Äôre also pretty cool.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-tom-paris-voyager-070055176.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7266a3c5-5c0c-4aae-a524-c1e29b2f43f6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914412</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:00:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5b547b0-05c7-11ec-bf8f-deb9637f2186" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5b547b0-05c7-11ec-bf8f-deb9637f2186" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["We'll Always Have Tom Paris√¢¬Ä¬ù -- Robert Duncan McNeill as Tom Paris of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

In a survey involving 24 federal agencies on their use of facial recognition technology, the Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice, State, Treasury and Veterans Affairs departments told GAO that they&#39;re planning to use facial recognition in more areas through fiscal year 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/25/federal-facial-recognition-expansion/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, most agencies already use facial recognition to give their personnel access to their phones and computers. However, there&#39;s a growing number of agencies using it to investigate crime and to track people. The Department of Agriculture apparently wants to monitor the live feeds at its facilities and scan for individuals in the watch list. Another agency wants to use it to automate identity verification for travelers at airports.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The agencies are planning this expansion despite the strengthening pushback against facial recognition systems. They&#39;re still far from being perfectly accurate, especially when identifying women and POCs, and have led to false arrests in the past. In Detroit, their use led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-false-match-wrongful-arrest-224053761.html">wrongful arrest</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest-michigan-141531393.html">two men</a> last year, both of whom are Black. The states of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/massachusetts-statewide-police-ban-facial-recognition-bill-064534909.html">Massachusetts</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maine-facial-recognition-law-191252742.html">Maine</a> and Virginia banned law enforcement from using facial recognition. At the same time, several cities across the US, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/portland-facial-recognition-ban-035952590.html">Portland, Oregon</a>, had also restricted their use. GAO&#39;s report noted, however, that &quot;recent advancements in facial recognition technology have increased its accuracy and its usage.&quot;</p><p>Ten of GAO&#39;s respondents have also revealed they&#39;ve been involved in the research and development of facial recognition tech. For instance, they&#39;re looking into the technology&#39;s ability to identify individuals wearing masks and to detect image manipulation. In addition, several agencies, including the Justice Department, the Air Force and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted to using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-clearview-ai-police-surveillance-explained.html">Clearview AI</a>. Clearview has been under fire for scraping people&#39;s images from social networks over the past years without the companies&#39; knowledge or consent to build its database. As of last year, the system, which can identify people in real time, was reportedly in use by 600 police departments across the US, including the FBI and DHS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ten-federal-agencies-expanding-facial-recognition-070044629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18ed097f-1c22-4cce-845c-29c80470f405</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629961260</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T07:01:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d6385430-0632-11ec-9d54-a4ebe312b944" width="5988" height="3992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d6385430-0632-11ec-9d54-a4ebe312b944" width="5988" height="3992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Selective Focus Of People Faces Recognized With Intellectual Learning System]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[People Faces Recognized With Intellectual Learning System]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A year later, we now know more about Facebook's Project Aria AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To say that Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-first-ar-glasses-will-be-here-next-year-180101648.html">Project Aria AR glasses</a> were never meant for consumers would be an understatement. Facebook does not even consider them a prototype. And they are not, and may never be, available for purchase. Rather, Facebook has always described them as a way for its employees to study and test augmented reality tech.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/">announcement at the time</a> made clear the company&#39;s intentions, it was light on details about how the glasses would actually work. Now, nearly a year after the initial launch, a series of regulatory documents are giving us a belated first peek inside. In a <a href="https://fccid.io/2AWS6-5646/User-Manual/Users-Manual-5086339.pdf">user manual</a> first reported by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/project-aria-gemini-ar-glasses"><em>Protocol</em></a>, we learn that this specific device goes by the codename Gemini EVT, with EVT being an abbreviation for &quot;engineering valuation test.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might expect, given the stated purpose of the device, there is no visual AR component. Meaning, there&#39;s no built-in display for viewing 3D image overlays. Again, the glasses in their early form really do exist just for this small team of engineers to collect data.</p><p>Not that you can buy one but if you could, the glasses would also support prescription lenses, the manual reveals.</p><p>Additionally, the manual indicates there&#39;s a proximity sensor on the inner temple, along with four cameras that can capture both video and still photos. Interestingly, Facebook used the same camera sensors here that it did on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2 headset</a>, our review of which we published the same day in September last year that Facebook announced Project Aria. Given the timing, it may just be those sensors were the most readily available to Facebook.</p><p>Also inside is a Qualcomm chipset, with a modified version of Android powering the software experience. Charging happens via a USB cable, which attached magnetically to the glasses.</p><p>The user experience seems simple, as far as we can tell. There are shutter and power buttons, plus a mute switch that &quot;toggles privacy mode on/off.&quot; When a recording is in progress, a series of LEDs help passerby understand that the camera is on. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a companion iOS app called Ariane that handles the basics: device setup, scanning for WiFi networks, showing the battery status and uploading what data the sensors have collected. It&#39;s unclear, however, if there is also an Android version of the app that exists, or is in the works. Again, not that you&#39;d be able to download it either way.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-project-aria-ar-glasses-details-030106045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f45a3b4-19b9-45a2-8baa-7dd8f762b306</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 03:01:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629981489</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T12:38:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a207b30-066a-11ec-bf5f-0c8d42b77df7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a207b30-066a-11ec-bf5f-0c8d42b77df7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A promo image for the Facebook Project Aria smartglasses, showing a man wearing them outside from his right profile and holding a smartphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Project Aria]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing its Office app on Chromebooks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re not sure who or how many people use Microsoft Office on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebook</a> but if that&#39;s you, you&#39;re in for a downgraded experience.

The company has begun to approach academics and policy experts, who <em>The Times</em> says could potentially weigh in on issues ranging from political ads to election misinformation. What&#39;s more, it is not just US elections where a commission could find itself weighing complicated election issues; the commission would also likely have a mandate to weigh in on closely watched elections in Hungary, Germany, Brazil and the Philippines.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On its face, the commission sounds a lot like Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board, an independent panel of journalists, academics and activists often described as a &quot;Supreme Court&quot; that&#39;s tasked with reviewing Facebook&#39;s policies.

As <em>CNN</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html">reports</a>, Yara International now expects to sail the first autonomous, fully electric cargo ship in Norway by the end of 2021. The Yara Birkeland will travel from Her√∏ya to Brevik with only three remote control centers keeping watch over the journey.</p><p>Yara first developed the concept in 2017 and had planned to set sail in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the trip. It&#39;s not the first crewless ship of any kind to venture forth (a Finnish ferry launched in 2018), but it is the first all-electric model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a slow vessel with a 13-knot top speed from its two 900kW propulsion systems (container ships typically travel at 16 to 25 knots), and it&#39;s safe to say the giant 7MWh battery will take a while to charge. However, Yara believes it will be worthwhile for the environmental gains. The firm estimated the Yara Birkeland would replace about 40,000 truck trips per year, dramatically reducing CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions in a country that already relies heavily on hydroelectric power. The ship could also alleviate traffic congestion on land, not to mention keep humans out of  danger (albeit at the possible expense of jobs).</p><p>It may still be a long while before you see autonomous cargo haulers making trips elsewhere. Even if range isn&#39;t an issue, docks are ‚Äî it would be harder for a self-sailing ship to navigate a busy port like Durban or Shanghai. There are also legal issues. Different countries have their own rules for the sea. As with self-driving cars, there&#39;s also the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-19-waymo-strikes-deal-to-insure-self-driving-taxi-service.html">matter of liability</a>. Who&#39;s to blame if an autonomous ship runs aground? While it&#39;s easy to see a day when autonomous electric ships are commonplace, that day likely isn&#39;t close at hand.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yara-birkeland-autonomous-electric-cargo-ship-launch-date-211945689.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a554dc5-6b42-469f-84ce-70a6d6d58246</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 21:19:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629926965</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T21:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4511d910-05e5-11ec-bd37-b7ea67bd8077" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4511d910-05e5-11ec-bd37-b7ea67bd8077" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yara International]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yara Birkeland autonomous electric cargo ship]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yara Birkeland autonomous electric cargo ship]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sifu's slick kung fu battles arrive on PlayStation and PC February 22nd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Sifu"><em><ins>Sifu</ins></em></a> has been on our radar for a while, but until now, it hasn&#39;t been clear when exactly we&#39;d get our hands on the kung fu action title.

And, faced with criticism over its handling of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a>, the company has argued that vaccine misinformation isn‚Äôt representative of the kind of content most users see.</p><p>Both Facebook and YouTube have come under particular scrutiny for their policies around health misinformation during the pandemic. Both platforms have well over a billion users, which means that even a small fraction of content can have a far-reaching impact. And both platforms have so far declined to disclose details about how vaccine and health misinformation spreads or how many users are encountering it. Mahon also said that removing misinformation is only one aspect of the company‚Äôs approach. YouTube is also working on ‚Äúratcheting up information from trusted sources and reducing the spread of videos with harmful misinformation.‚Äù</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-covid-19-misinformation-takedowns-201041091.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d891337-3285-46ce-932f-4f90933639f9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 20:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629921949</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T20:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The YouTube video app is seen on various digital devices on 28 March, 2017.

This won&#39;t suddenly drag the game into the next-gen console era, but the improved frame rate should make it that much easier to dodge charging robots and line up bow shots.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-193911645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d38aaedb-d832-4f22-9853-30e33ed1b628</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:39:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920354</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerilla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Portal shooter 'Splitgate' launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.splitgate.com/"><em>Splitgate</em></a><em>, </em>an FPS that combines the best of classic Quake multiplayer and <em>Portal</em>, is an unlikely shooter success story. It reached an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">astounding 10 million downloads </a>during its open beta last month, when it made its way to consoles and unveiled cross-platform play. And to celebrate that success, today developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">launched its next beta phase</a>: Season 0.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In the span of a month, our servers went from supporting 4,000 players at once to 175,000 players!&quot; <em>Splitgate </em>creator and 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx wrote on the PlayStation blog. &quot;All in all, our servers had some growing pains, so we had to implement short-term solutions to prevent back-end crashes.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d8355b3defe486dbb30122f5ee506f3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Given the influx of new users, Proulx says he chose to delay the game&#39;s official launch and extend the beta phase. Existing players can expect a slew of new content in Season 0, including Karman Station, a new map, as well as a new Infection gameplay mode. There&#39;s also a Season 0 Battle Pass and plenty of new gear to pick up. They have to support a free-to-play game somehow, right?&nbsp;</p><p>After spending more than 10 hours in the previous <em>Splitgate</em> beta, it&#39;s easy to see why the game has caught on so quickly. It combines solid shooter mechanics with something entirely new: The ability to place portals around the map, which you can use to teleport or take out enemies. If anything, it&#39;s a welcome respite from the flood of Battle Royale titles on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Splitgate</em> doesn&#39;t have an official launch date yet, the beta is pretty stable in my experience. Proulx says 1047 Games is also work on a map editor, as well as additional maps, weapons and other items in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-season-0-beta-launch-193849912.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51b65339-73b8-4ffa-a32e-fdf23c158624</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:38:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920373</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portal shooter &#39;Splitgate&#39; launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga' will arrive in spring 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We haven&#39;t heard much about <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> since TT Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-delayed-indefinitely-162934202.html">delayed it indefinitely</a> back in April.

XCOM developer Firaxis has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz8Vw5tOf5M">unveiled</a><em>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns</em>, a turn-based role-playing game based on the Midnight Sons team from 1990s crossover issues.

Your character will have help from Midnight Sons members like Blade, Ghost Rider and Wolverine as well as Avengers mainstays like Captain America and Iron Man.</p><p>The title reaches PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch and Windows PCs in March 2022. A gameplay presentation is due on September 1st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In case you&#39;re wondering: no, this won&#39;t just be an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2-k-marvel-xcom-borderlands-spinoff-141527233.html">XCOM game with capes</a>. Game lead Jake Solomon told <em>Polygon</em> in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22641096/marvels-midnight-suns-is-the-next-game-from-the-xcom-team">interview</a> that <em>Midnight Suns</em> shares &quot;zero mechanics&quot; with the XCOM series. You&#39;ll play missions with up to three other heroes as you develop The Hunter&#39;s powers. When you&#39;re not in combat, an open-world area will help you form bonds with fellow heroes. And instead of the paranoia and fear that drive XCOM, you&#39;re rolling into battle with confidence ‚Äî there&#39;s no permanent character death, for starters.</p><p>This is something of a gamble when many Marvel appearances have involved more conventional brawlers and fighting games. Firaxis has a strong track record, however, and dipping into the Midnight Sons catalog draw in both long-time Marvel fans as well as those who don&#39;t want to rehash the brand&#39;s most familiar stories.</p><div id="a32014456cdc4f7faf5a27abdc444838"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wz8Vw5tOf5M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvels-midnight-suns-release-date-trailer-191236120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6392f10-b089-45cf-bbb2-2f01e98a9acf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:12:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629918775</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:13:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Firaxis Games/2K]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Special-edition 'Halo Infinite' Xbox Series X and controller arrive on November 15th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em>Halo Infinite </em>release date</a>, Microsoft made a couple of other Halo-related announcements at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-how-to-watch-geoff-keighley-152019558.html">Gamescom&#39;s Opening Night Live event</a>.
