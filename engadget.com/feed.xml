He was also less-than-flattering to Virgin Galactic, describing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">first passenger flight</a> and Blue Origin&#39;s as &quot;a step in the direction of orbit&quot; that fell short of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-inspiration4-splashdown-live-stream-214529012.html">SpaceX&#39;s efforts</a>.</p><p>While Musk is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-elon-musk-painted-as-thin-skinned-billionaire-in-court-documen.html">known for being harsh</a>, he might have some support in this case. <em>The Verge</em> has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia">obtained</a> NASA legal documents showing that the space agency felt Blue Origin &quot;gambled&quot; with its originally proposed $5.9 billion lunar lander price. Bezos&#39; company allegedly set the price far higher than necessary as it expected NASA to award the contract and negotiate for a lower cost. Blue Origin also reportedly assumed NASA would get the full funding from Congress needed for that initial price, even as the Senate made clear NASA wouldn&#39;t get the necessary amount.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You know what happened next. Rather than haggle the price, NASA picked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">$2.9 billion SpaceX bid</a>. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">challenged the award</a> and even made a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">last-ditch $2 billion offer</a>, but by then it was too late. The Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">rejected Blue Origin&#39;s claims</a>, saying NASA didn&#39;t violate regulations in picking SpaceX. Bezos&#39; outfit took NASA to court roughly two weeks later.</p><p>In an interview, Blue Origin VP Megan Mitchell told <em>The Verge</em> the company rejected NASA&#39;s views. She felt Blue Origin made a &quot;great offer&quot; and that it disagreed with NASA&#39;s gambling characterization. The GAO separately said NASA partly botched its safety review requirements for the proposal, although it still sided with SpaceX on grounds that Blue Origin didn&#39;t explain how the move provided an unfair edge.</p><p>This isn&#39;t to say Musk and SpaceX are innocent. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-spacex-sues-over-air-force-contracts.html">SpaceX sued the US</a> in 2019 after it lost an Air Force rocket contract to Blue Origin and other competitors, for example. It&#39;s just that Musk&#39;s trash talking appears to carry some weight in this modern Moon race.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5dceae2-669d-432e-bd0b-bc16a12e0509</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 15:11:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632928293</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T15:11:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d85fc750-fe4b-11eb-8e55-f2f4f16e40da" width="3678" height="2706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d85fc750-fe4b-11eb-8e55-f2f4f16e40da" width="3678" height="2706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PATRICK PLEUL via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US entrepreneur and business magnate Elon Musk gestures during a visit at the Tesla Gigafactory plant under construction, on August 13, 2021 in Gruenheide near Berlin, eastern Germany.

As of today, the social network is officially <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/launching-reels-on-facebook-in-us/">bringing Reels</a> to the main Facebook app. With the change, users can create Reels directly from Facebook, and the company will recommend the short-form videos in all users’ News Feeds.</p><p>Facebook has been testing out various ways of bringing Reels out of Instagram for awhile, and began testing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reels-us-test-172544167.html">cross-posting</a> features last month. Now, it’s also testing a feature that allows Reels creators on Instagram to promote their videos in Facebook’s News Feed directly, even if they don’t use the app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reels has become increasingly important to facebook and its efforts to challenge TikTok. The company has been steadily adding features to the service, and is attempting to lure creators with the promise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">of payouts</a> for hitting certain milestones. Now, the company is adding a new &quot;invite-only&quot; bonus program to coincide with Reels&#39; launch on Facebook and encourage creators to start posting on the social network.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f12971b0-20b4-11ec-bb4b-b96d9cf78b11" alt="Facebook will let creators promote Reels in News Feed." data-uuid="024d135b-be6f-3b4a-8c7f-b7e542d6f385"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>But it’s the potential challenge to TikTok that could be most significant for the company.

However, the company&#39;s more affordable options are still due for a refresh, and Sony begins that process today. With the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/truly-wireless/p/wfc500">WF-C500</a>, the company offers a solid set of true wireless earbuds capable of handling immersive 360 Reality Audio for $100. And if over-ear noise-cancelling headphones are more your vibe, the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/whxb910n">WF-XB910N</a> pairs ANC (active noise cancellation) with 30-hour battery life for $250.&nbsp;</p><p>The true wireless WF-C500 replaces the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-xb700-review-true-wireless-earbuds-163042660.html">WF-XB700</a> at the bottom of Sony&#39;s price range. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re $30 cheaper than the XB700 was initially at $99.99. This substitution is a good thing because despite handling the basics well, the tiered design wasn&#39;t as ergonomic or comfy as the company suggested. With the WF-C500, Sony takes design cues from its high-end WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The result is smaller size and a more secure fit that should be more comfortable during hours of continuous use. And an IPX4 rating means you can use these during workouts without worrying about moisture damage.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, the C500 is equipped with Sony&#39;s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) that restores some of the detail lost when music is compressed for streaming over Bluetooth. The company also allows you employ sound presets and adjust the EQ with its Headphones app. Plus, you have the option of listening in Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio if you&#39;re willing to splurge for the priciest streaming plan on select services (Amazon Music HD, Tidal HiFi, etc.). On-board controls give you the ability to manage music, adjust volume, take calls and activate a voice assistant without reaching for your phone. Lastly, the C500 will give you up to 10 hours of listening time with one additional charge in the included case. A quick-charge feature offers an hour of tunes in 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The WF-C500 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:pre-order" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CFP6J6D/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">pre-order</a> today, but colors vary by retailer.

The earbuds are set to ship in October.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8888e3c0-2122-11ec-988d-273ba59d1db8" alt="Sony XB-910N" data-uuid="839cb176-84c6-3bdb-8012-1e70167e5b04"><figcaption>Sony XB-910N</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>For the over-ear noise-cancelling crowd, the WH-XB910N replaces the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-25-sony-xb900n-noise-cancelling-headphones-review.html">WH-XB900N</a> in the middle of Sony&#39;s headphone lineup. The price stays the same at $249.99, but the company offers a new design and improved ANC thanks to a Dual Noise Sensor. As the &quot;XB&quot; signifies, this model is equipped with the company&#39;s Extra Bass feature that amps up the low-end tone when activated. DSEE tech makes streaming over Bluetooth a bit more enjoyable by restoring detail lost to compression. The XB910N can also manage Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio content and employs Adaptive Sound Control, a staple of the company&#39;s pricier headphones, that can automatically adjust settings based on activity or location.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony is also angling at the remote working crowd here. The company explains that Precise Voice Pickup tech uses a combination of microphones and signal processing to amplify your voice on calls. There&#39;s also &quot;a more natural listening experience&quot; in ambient sound mode as Sony says the XB910N can pick up more of what&#39;s going on around you. That&#39;s handy whether you need to stay tuned in to what&#39;s going on either at home or in the office. On-board controls include Sony&#39;s quick attention feature which lets outside noise in when you place your hand over an earcup and there&#39;s a dedicated button to quickly change from ANC to ambient sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony says the XB910N will last up to 30 hours with the option of 4.5 hours of listening time after a 10-minute quick charge. To further cater to travelers, the company opted for soft, oval-shaped earpads for extra cushion and a design that folds flat for easy storage. If you prefer to save even more on your noise-cancelling headphones, the excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html">WH-CH710N</a> will stick around and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:are currently $98" href="https://amzn.to/3B70fzT">are currently $98</a>. Although they lack a lot of the handy features from Sony&#39;s other models, the noise-cancelling CH710N are light and comfy, handling the basics very well for that price.</p><p>The WF-C500 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:pre-order" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CGB6VRR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">pre-order</a> today, and once again, the colors vary by retailer.

You can also drive in a full hybrid mode for peak performance and an &quot;eSave&quot; mode to preserve the 17kWh battery for later.</p><p>You can also expect new technology inside, such as 10-inch front and rear passenger displays with built-in Fire TV — your kids can stream Prime Video in the backseat. The driver, meanwhile, gets a 10-inch display with a much faster Uconnect 5 platform that supports over-the-air updates.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 4xe and its regular counterparts are improved off-roaders with semi-active damping for air suspension as well as a front-axle disconnect when the SUV senses it doesn&#39;t need all-wheel drive. You&#39;ll also get semi-autonomous help through an optional Active Driving Assist system that takes over so long as your hands are on the wheel and your eyes are on the road. Jeep is promising a 6,000lbs maximum towing capacity.</p><p>Jeep hasn&#39;t divulged pricing for the Grand Cherokee 4xe, although it will be available in increasingly loaded Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve editions. It&#39;s already safe to say this is an important vehicle for the brand, though. Parent company Stellantis is racing to catch up with rivals in electrifying its vehicles, with plans for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-4xe-2025-plan-200527710.html">fully electric version of every SUV</a> by 2025. The plug-in hybrid is a critical first step in that direction.</p><div id="5d876757aa724fbc8da23c5b2cb894f5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FucFL3G7VXY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jeep-grand-cherokee-4xe-plug-in-hybrid-141057823.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c4a2df4-297e-47cb-96e9-eacf46295378</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 14:10:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632924660</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T14:11:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/86e297b0-212b-11ec-8bef-bda4f50680f5" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/86e297b0-212b-11ec-8bef-bda4f50680f5" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stellantis]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe plug-in hybrid]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe plug-in hybrid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube bans all content containing vaccine misinformation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a> has <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/managing-harmful-vaccine-content-youtube/">banned all videos</a> containing misinformation about vaccines that are currently administered and have been approved by local health authorities or the World Health Organization.

With the introduction of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$180 Charge 5" href="https://amzn.to/3AYugBu">$180 Charge 5</a> this year, the company is trying to modernize its most capable band. It’s thinner, lighter and less bulky than the Charge 4 and it now has some features previously reserved for Fitbit’s full-fledged smartwatches, the Versa and Sense.</p><p>That translates to a $30 increase in price, and on top of that, Fitbit’s hoping you’ll pay $10 each month to access your historical health data (and more) through Fitbit Premium. The Charge 5 certainly feels more polished than the Charge 4, but those who prefer bands to smartwatches will find that most core features remain the same — and you’ll have to decide if the perks of Premium are really worth paying for.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>I was surprised by how much of a difference was made by Fitbit updating the design of the Charge 5. It’s 10 percent thinner than the previous version and has new rounded edges, and the module itself is stainless steel in a color that should complement the band choice you picked. It feels less bulky on the wrist and its rounded edges make it so the device doesn’t stick out as much. If you’re wearing the band tightly, the Charge 5 sits more flush against the wrist than the Charge 4 did, so it’s less obtrusive and more comfortable. The strap is also better, too: the Charge 5 comes with a soft-touch band that looks (and hooks) almost like the Apple Watch’s sport bands.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6d232dd4-2ba0-4dc3-b31d-dd4167737ea9"/><p>The display has been updated as well: it’s a 1.04-inch color AMOLED touchscreen that wakes up when you lift your wrist. It’s leaps and bounds better than the grayscale OLED screen on the Charge 4 and it puts the Charge 5 more in line with Fitbit’s smartwatches.</p><p>It also has a new always-on feature, which you can activate in the settings. It will automatically turn off at night if you have sleep mode turned on, but otherwise, it keeps the clock and watch face on, if slightly dimmed, all day long. This obviously affects battery life and Fitbit makes that clear.</p><p>But with the addition of a touchscreen, Fitbit took all physical buttons off of the Charge 5. You may think the shiny slivers on the long edges of the module are capacitive-touch buttons but they’re not — they’re actually the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html">electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors</a> that enable stress monitoring. While I didn’t have any problems using the touchscreen, it was a bit weird to not have a button to fall back on because I was used to the inductive side button on the Charge 4.</p><h2>New (and old) features</h2><p>Fitbit trickled down a few advanced features from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">Sense smartwatch</a> to the Charge 5, namely ECG measurements and EDA monitoring. The former is “coming soon,” so I wasn’t able to test it, but the latter is similar to the EDA tool on Fitbit’s smartwatch. Instead of covering the device’s screen with your palm like you would on the Sense, the Charge 5 has two long sensors on its sides that you pinch and hold when you want to take an EDA scan.</p><p>At first, I didn’t know you could change the duration of each scan, so I sat in semi-frustrated silence for three whole minutes (torture, I know). The EDA sensor looks for changes in your skin that may be linked to stress and it’ll report how many differences it captured at the end of the scan. The Charge 5 reported 18 incidents in my first session, which probably reflected my increasing frustration with the tool as I used it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa2d9b0-1fb4-11ec-b6ff-0a4d01ae4fea" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="db0fb90f-ea72-3370-88c8-581a51385679"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The device’s screen counts down the remaining time in your scan, but it doesn’t show anything else. Fitbit used to have guided breathing exercises on its devices which would take you through a few minutes of breathwork with the intention of calming you down. Fitbit still has meditation exercises available in its app (most available via Premium, with only a scant few free) but I wish Fitbit had brought over that aspect into its EDA tool on the Charge 5. I never felt significantly more calm after a scan — if anything, pausing during my busy day to have my fitness tracker tell me that I might be stressed, without providing any aid, made me more annoyed than less.</p><p>Otherwise, the Charge 5 is much the same as the Charge 4, although all of its features look a bit more glossy thanks to the full-color screen. The GPS was, arguably, the most important thing about the Charge 4 and it remains solid on the Charge 5. The built-in sensor grabbed my location within seconds of me starting a run and my route was accurately mapped in Fitbit app after I synced.</p><p>But Fitbit didn’t add more music-focused features. In fact, it actually removed some, which is a bummer. The Charge 4 had no onboard storage and only Spotify Premium subscribers could control playback from its screen. According to Fitbit, it’s data showed that customers weren’t using the music controls a lot, so they removed the Spotify option as well. While I understand the logic, I was disappointed each time I ran with the Charge 5 — I would turn to my wrist to skip a track only to immediately realize I had to take my phone out of my fanny pack.</p><p>On a positive note, Fitbit added solid alarm and timer apps on the Charge 5. The device is not designed to have as many onboard programs as a smartwatch, but these are pretty basic and many fitness bands include them. I love being able to set daily alarms so I never forget to take medication, and I inevitably end up setting a timer or two each day to keep track of laundry, cooking food and the like.</p><h2>What you get with Premium</h2><p>Fitbit has been slowly incorporating Premium, its $10-per-month health and fitness service, into all of its devices over the past few years. What that means for the Charge 5 is that some advanced metrics are behind that paywall, along with things like wellness reports, guided workouts, meditations, recipe inspiration and more.</p><p>My biggest problem lies with the walled-off health metrics. It essentially means that Fitbit users can only get the data necessary to up their sleep and exercise game if they pay for it. You may only realize how much of your data you don’t have access to after using the Charge 5 for months, too, which is a bummer (you get six months of Fitbit Premium when you buy a new Charge 5, so at least you’ll get a taste of it).</p><p>For example, Premium gives you access to 30-day and 90-day health trends based on your recorded data, plus “advanced” health insights related to your heart, activity, sleep and more. And Fitbit’s wellness reports, which gathers your recorded information about heart rate, steps, weight, water and food intake, exercise, sleep and more for you to easily give to your doctor, are only available to subscribers.</p><section data-eng-breakout="16cb92944be84298bbf7272c804217de" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a94cff0-1fb4-11ec-bfff-fff79ac5bf9d" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="e072e3eb-b801-3314-8ce6-54948bb7febb"></section><p>A new feature only available to Premium subscribers is what Fitbit calls a Daily Readiness Score. It basically tells you how ready your body is to work out any given day based on things like heart rate variability, sleep and fitness fatigue. This sounds similar to Garmin’s Body Battery score (which, by the way, doesn’t cost anything extra).</p><p>However, I couldn’t test this out because it’s “coming soon” just like the ECG app I mentioned earlier. Fitbit has hyped up its new products with coming-soon features for years, with at least a few of them taking forever to actually arrive. It should go without saying, but I wouldn’t recommend buying a Fitbit device for any yet-to-be-released features — it may take months for them to actually arrive.</p><p>This isn’t a Fitbit Premium review — I haven’t gathered enough data with the Charge 5 to get the most out of the service, and that can only be done by spending at least a few weeks to a few months with it. But I will say that Premium really isn’t for someone like me who already has a fitness system in place and already tries to eat as healthily as possible (most of the time). But it may be useful for those just getting started on their fitness journey, whether that means they’re trying to lose weight, exercise more regularly or eat better. Premium’s video workouts and recipe inspirations aren’t particularly special (I guarantee you’ve seen similar one-minute recipe videos on Instagram), but having them all in one place encourages you to use them on a daily basis. A common idea in the fitness world is that the hardest part of working out is actually showing up to do it. That can translate to many parts of someone’s health journey — Fitbit’s Premium service removes a lot of the guesswork that can make living healthier seem inconvenient.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Fitbit promises up to seven days of life on the Charge 5, but that estimate drops to two days when you have the screen in always-on mode. Thankfully, Fitbit’s estimates were mostly correct — I got about two and half days with always-on mode enabled and five with it disabled. Just keep in mind that how often you use the built-in GPS will affect battery life, too. During my time with the device, I used the GPS almost every other day for 45 minutes to one hour during my runs.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>It’s hard to compare the Fitbit Charge 5 to other fitness trackers because there aren’t many at the $180 price point. Most simple band-style trackers are more affordable, like the $80 Garmin Vivofit 4 or the $130 Vivosmart 4, while smartwatches like the $200 Garmin Forerunner 55 dominate the higher end. Arguably the most comparable device out of those is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Vivosmart 4" href="https://fave.co/39sQGih">Vivosmart 4</a>, which has a thinner design but a less exciting, grayscale OLED screen. It also only has connected GPS, not onboard, but it does have features like all-day activity monitoring, workout tracking, VO2 max measurements, Body Battery scores, sleep and blood oxygen tracking and more. It also <em>does</em> have music controls directly on the device and a similarly long battery life.</p><p>And when it comes to Fitbit’s own lineup, the Charge 5 shares a lot of features with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:$150 Luxe" href="https://bit.ly/36rcNnW">$150 Luxe</a>. Sure, the latter is thinner and targeted more towards those who want a bracelet-like wearable, but it’s more affordable and has a full-color display (which will soon support always-on mode), activity and sleep tracking, smartphone alerts, and more. What it doesn’t have is onboard GPS and Fitbit Pay.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>When you’re talking about $180 for the Charge 5, it’s tempting to say “just get a smartwatch instead.” You could get a capable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Garmin smartwatch" href="https://fave.co/3CIT6FZ">Garmin smartwatch</a> for only $20 more than that, or even an Apple Watch Series 3 (although I wouldn’t recommend the latter). But one of the reasons many will consider the Charge 5 is its band style — some people just prefer that to larger smartwatches. In general, fitness bands have lower profiles, multi-day battery life and they typically keep fitness at the forefront. If that sounds like what you’re looking for in a wearable, the Charge 5 is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>But considering its biggest perks are onboard GPS and Fitbit Pay support with NFC, the Charge 5 remains pretty similar to the Charge 4. It’s also disappointing that Fitbit didn’t really <em>fix</em> much about the previous band other than its dated design. You still have a limited selection of apps on the Charge 5, it doesn’t integrate with Apple Health or Google Fit and Fitbit removed all music control functionality, even for Spotify Premium users. I’d expect more progress and differentiation in a device that now costs $30 more. You could safely skip this update if your Charge 4 is still serving you well. But if you don’t have a fitness tracker right now, the Charge 5 remains one of your best options if you’re looking for a capable band with built-in GPS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1142c649-183f-4abe-8036-1d0d24d5c7a5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 13:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632862328</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T20:52:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d70-1fb4-11ec-ae32-4a7ac16d5232" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d70-1fb4-11ec-ae32-4a7ac16d5232" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve is reportedly working on a standalone VR headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brad Lynch, a YouTube host who reports on virtual reality, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp42lQYVzwo">found</a> evidence from patent applications and other sources that Valve is currently working on a standalone VR headset codenamed &quot;Deckard.&quot; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/a-new-standalone-valve-vr-headset-teased-by-deep-steamvr-file-dive/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> has independently confirmed that the company is indeed developing a device with that codename.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lynch found references to multiple iterations of Deckard, including a &quot;proof of concept&quot; in June. Valve is apparently planning to give it the ability to bring up two SteamVR menu options: prism and standalone system layer. The latter, as you may have guessed, implies that the device could work on its own without the need to be tethered to a PC. If you&#39;ll recall, Valve&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Index VR headset</a> released in 2019 has to be attached to a computer to work. The YouTube host also discovered a mention of Deckard in a SteamVR Linux ARM binary. That particular evidence hints at processing power built into a Valve VR headset, further solidifying the possibility that it&#39;s a standalone device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to<em> Ars Technica&#39;s </em>sources, Valve was developing two design concepts for a virtual reality headset. One of them ended up resembling the Index in that it needs to connect to a PC and to SteamVR Tracking Boxes. The other ended up being designed around a built-in processor with inside-out tracking like the Oculus Quest. Those sources also hinted that Valve had to bring in an outside firm to develop inside-out tracking that could match what the Quest can do.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether the standalone VR headset will ever be released remains to be seen. As the publication notes, Valve is already preparing to start shipping the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> in December. With the current chip shortage affecting the tech and auto industries today, we may have to wait quite a bit for Deckard if Valve decides to release it at all.</p><div id="2cab72202c95443eb59e8628c4483f03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp42lQYVzwo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-standalone-vr-headset-report-120909267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f645a2ba-6fb4-479f-90cf-feaaa62f9ba4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:09:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632917384</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T12:09:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon reveals its periscope-equipped Alexa robot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon’s annual barrage of new Echo hardware didn’t disappoint, ranging from role-playing games to nutrition tracking, drones and videocall devices for kids.

Aimed at families, the Echo Show 15 also has a new visual ID feature that can recognize your face and show you personalized information, like calendar appointments, reminders and notes.</p><p>Amazon and Google dominate the smart displays space, and I might be the rare exception of having not a single Alexa-powered device in my home. So far, Amazon’s devices haven’t offered anything particularly compelling for me. I have a Google smart display, which smoothly integrates with Google Calendar, Google Maps and the rest. It’s hard for me to generate much enthusiasm for the Echo range.</p><p>Now, having said that, let me contradict myself entirely.</p><p>If you like your Alexa devices on wheels and with precarious extendable, periscope cameras, then perhaps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Amazon’s Astro robot</a> might get you excited.

It only grew stronger as <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-devices-services-news-september-2021">the event</a> progressed, with many new Amazon products seeming incredibly familiar. The company has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peak-design-amazon-video-175235085.html">criticized in the past</a> for borrowing designs of popular goods and selling them for a lot cheaper.</p><p>That’s not an uncommon practice of course — massive retailers all over America like Walmart and Costco have offered lower-cost store-brand lines forever. But none of them stage flashy keynotes to tout their products as “innovations.” While Amazon has indeed brought certain unique technologies to the world in the past, this year the company’s “innovations” seemed to be more of it doing what it does best: undercutting the rest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Halo View: Twinning with Fitbit</h2><p>With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">the Halo View</a>, Amazon is essentially adding a display to its existing screenless health-tracking band. But the View’s shape and style are so similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html">Fitbit’s Charge series</a> it’s hard to differentiate the two. Sure, there are only so many ways you can stick a rectangular display on a wristband, but Amazon’s mimicry doesn’t stop there. It also introduced new Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition services today that will offer guides on working out and eating better.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50269ed0-207a-11ec-b5f7-3e575d322de7" alt="Amazon Halo View" data-uuid="1880500c-375f-3ee2-8ffa-5f360311fa39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>That’s basically Fitbit Premium, which offers guides on working out and eating better. Oh and Fitbit’s $10-a-month service also provides tips on meditating and sleep. Amazon’s subscription costs just $4 per month after a trial period, though, and the $80 Halo View is $100 cheaper than the new Charge 5. The View probably won’t do as much as Fitbit’s trackers, which are quite sophisticated. Still, considering the price, Amazon will likely sell a lot of them.</p><h2>Amazon Smart Thermostat: Lose the frills for a fraction of the price</h2><p>Amazon teamed up with existing thermostat brand Honeywell to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Smart Thermostat</a> that will work with most existing 24V HVACs (most common for residential HVAC systems). You can control it with a separate Alexa-enabled device and set custom routines for heating and cooling. The company hasn’t released much more information about its thermostat yet, but from what we can see, the device has the rounded-rectangle shape of an ecobee smart thermostat with the color scheme of a Google Nest product.</p><p>Lots of existing smart thermostats by brands like ecobee, Sensibo and Google’s Nest do more things, but Amazon is seriously undercutting the competition by selling its version for just $60. The Nest Thermostat that was launched last year costs $130, while an <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/">ecobee 3 Lite goes for $170</a>.</p><h2>Blink cameras: Competing with Google for much cheaper</h2><p>Competition in the security camera space is pretty stiff, so it isn’t very surprising that Amazon and Google both borrow a lot from each other. Amazon unveiled a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">new $50 Blink video doorbell camera</a> today, alongside a set of outdoor cameras. One of these is the $40 floodlight camera mount that calls to mind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html">Google’s Nest Cam with integrated floodlight</a>. To be fair, though, Google did only introduce a wireless, battery-powered doorbell camera after Blink, so it appears the borrowing is mutual here.</p><p>The difference, however, is once again in pricing. Blink’s video doorbell is less than a third of the price of the $180 Nest Doorbell. Google’s floodlight-cum-security camera is $280, while Amazon’s mount (with a camera) is <em>half</em> that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094YXVVRF">at $140</a>.</p><h2>But at what cost?</h2><p>It’s no secret that Amazon’s business model has a lot to do with knowing what people want and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-price-changes-2018-8">changing their prices accordingly</a>. But how can it <a href="https://www.thelist.com/412459/the-real-reason-amazon-essentials-products-are-so-cheap/">make things so cheap</a>? In addition to pure economies of scale and multiple reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/magazine/amazon-workers-employees-covid-19.html">questionable (at best) labor practices</a>, the company also offers goods at reduced prices in exchange for sticking ads on your devices. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1YQ0NCUZZMIZF/">ad-supported versions of Kindles</a> and Fire tablets often go for $20 to $30 less than their stock counterparts.</p><p>With the breadth of devices Amazon offers, too, the sheer amount of data it could collect purely for the sake of selling you stuff is huge. With the smart thermostat, it could detect a dip in temperature in your region and suggest you buy from its in-house brand of winter wear. Or maybe your child’s been reading a book on a Kindle, and the company later serves ads for collectibles from that title on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html">new kid-centric Glow video-calling device</a>. Or how about a subsidized version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">the Astro robot</a> that roams your house or follows you around with an ad on its face? Amazon also talked about a “vision of ambient intelligence” — which sounds very similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yexspE0prM">concept of “ambient computing”</a> expounded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">by Google for years</a>. But because Amazon’s products are so much cheaper, it could succeed at stuffing Alexa in so many more places in our lives.</p><p>Plus, with all the data it’s gathering from your shopping habits, whether it’s on one of its devices or the Amazon app, the company can afford to sell you something at a lower profit margin. The company said in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ">its privacy notice that</a> it’s “not in the business of selling our customers&#39; personal information to others.” But it’s presumably using that data to understand the types of things you’re more likely to buy and put that stuff in front of you. It’ll probably make more off of you in the long run if you’re using the cheap Fire tablet to browse its store.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that <em>everything</em> Amazon unveiled today was a cutrate version of something else. We got an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">update on the Ring Always Home Cam</a>, which was first announced last year. You’ll soon be able to sign up to test it out. The home security device is a little drone that can fly around your property at your command to see if anything’s amiss. No mainstream tech giant has launched something similar yet, though, so Amazon isn’t undercutting anyone on this.</p><p>Still, it seems like the company’s strategy for its flagship products is similar to that of its Basics line: Take a good idea, tweak it and sell it for loads cheaper. It’s not terrible; We could always use affordable, reliable devices.

The move comes weeks after the country&#39;s high court <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/australias-top-court-finds-media-companies-liable-for-other-peoples-facebook-comments-11631096115?mod=article_inline">ruled</a> that media companies are liable for the comments left by other people on their Facebook posts. A <em>CNN</em> spokesperson told the publication that users in Australia will no longer be able to see its main Facebook page, its CNN International page and the dedicated pages for its shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Dylan Voller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/technology/facebook-australia-comments.html">filed</a> the original case that prompted Australia&#39;s courts to decide whether media organizations should be liable for comments left on their Facebook pages. Voller became famous back in 2016 after a TV exposé on the mistreatment of minors in the criminal detention system showed a photo of him hooded and strapped to a chair when he was only 17. Major news outlets used that photo for their articles that were then posted on Facebook, where commenters falsely accused Voller of serious crimes, such as raping an elderly woman.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A <em>CNN</em> source told <em>The Journal</em> that the organization asked Facebook if it would help media companies disable comments entirely. However, the social network reportedly declined to disable all comments on <em>CNN&#39;s</em> pages in Australia. Facebook rolled out a tool back in March that allows celebrities, politicians and news outlets to restrict who can comment on their pages, but they&#39;d still have to set a restriction for every post. <em>CNN</em> has decided that doing so for all its properties would be time-consuming and opted to completely block Australia instead.</p><p>A <em>CNN</em> spokesperson said:</p><blockquote><p>“We are disappointed that Facebook, once again, has failed to ensure its platform is a place for credible journalism and productive dialogue around current events among its users.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As for Facebook, it told <em>The Journal</em> that it supports the reform of Australia&#39;s defamation laws. In addition, it said it provided <em>CNN</em> with features it can use to manage comments and that it continues to &quot;provide Australians a destination for quality journalism, including through Facebook News which we launched in August.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Australia also passed a law that requires tech giants to pay news outlets for using their content. As a response, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-australia-news-ban-took-down-government-pages-045625746.html">blocked</a> Australian publishers and residents from sharing news content. It quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-australia-news-043441256.html">rolled back</a> the ban, however, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/977776254/facebook-reaches-deal-with-news-corp-australia-to-pay-for-news-content">agreed to pay</a> some news organizations for their content.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cnn-restricts-access-facebook-pages-australia-083645494.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fecd6b5b-a8fa-405c-9215-15aa924955e2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 08:36:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632904639</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T08:37:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Feb 16, 2020 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign, located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters, Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says the iPad mini's 'jelly scrolling' problem is normal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">iPad mini</a> was released, people started complaining about seeing a weird &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6-jelly-scrolling-200628505.html">jelly-like</a>&quot; effect on their screens while scrolling. It appears as if one side of the screen scrolls at a different rate than the other, making it look like the screen is wobbling. Those who were hoping for a fix to the problem would probably be disappointed by Apple&#39;s response, because the tech giant has told <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> that the device&#39;s screen wobbling problem isn&#39;t a problem at all.</p><p>A spokesperson told the publication that the jelly-like effect people are seeing is typical for LCD screens, because they refresh line by line. As such, it&#39;s normal for the lines at the top of the display to refresh at a different rate than the lines at the bottom. <em>Ars Technica</em> insists, though, that the effect is much more noticeable on the iPad mini than it is on other 60Hz LCD iPads, including the latest entry-level model that was released with the mini. Further, there&#39;s a visible line dividing the screen in the middle when the tablet is in portrait mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It remains to be seen whether Apple would do something about this jelly scrolling effect in the future, considering people are airing complaints about it. For now, it looks the tech giant&#39;s stance is that it&#39;s par for the course for an LCD screen and that users will just have to get used to it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scrolling-problem-response-073027688.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca92c182-583d-4519-a2ea-a0ee983ad655</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 07:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632924799</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T14:13:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ea139ff0-20ef-11ec-bdde-6c9e8138e6c8" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ea139ff0-20ef-11ec-bdde-6c9e8138e6c8" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver’s watch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Withings is today launching the ScanWatch Horizon, a dolled-up version of its ScanWatch inside the body of a diving watch. Horizon comes in a bigger, 43mm case size, but is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-hands-on-ifa-2020-070001875.html">otherwise the same device we already think is the best hybrid on the market</a>. That includes the built-in ECG, blood oxygen sensor and sleep apnea tracking, as well as the usual activity and sleep-monitoring features. You’ll also get the same pair of sub dials, one with a small digital screen for notifications, the other an analog activity counter.</p><p>At an event in Paris, we got a chance to see the ScanWatch Horizon and try it on, though it was a non-functional prototype. It&#39;s certainly as pretty in person as the photos show, and with the steel quick-release band, feels nice considering the price. For the first time, Withings will sell the ScanWatch Horizon at jewelers on top of other retail locations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9bb9e9b3-dade-44b4-aa29-58809b6f0f59"/><p>The company told Engadget that the chunkier Horizon model has a more &quot;masculine&quot; design for larger wrists, with only a 43mm model available. The original ScanWatch, by contrast, came in sizes ranging from 38mm to 42mm.</p><p>Sadly, the beefier body and higher price hasn’t added anything to the feature list, and so there’s no GPS on this watch unless your phone comes along for the ride. And, if we’re nit-picking, we can say that while it’s dressed to impress as a diving watch (with an accurate laser-engraved rotating bezel and Luminova watch hands) water resistance is limited to 10ATM. That allows for snorkeling, water activities and some scuba diving, but it isn&#39;t much compared to most serious diving watches.</p><p>That said, the smartwatch world is crying out for anything that matches premium diving watch styling with a hint of smarts. It can’t be that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-tag-heuer-connected-series-3.html">TAG Heuer’s Connected</a> is allowed to become the default in this market by default, especially since it’s running, you know, <em>Wear OS</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/54caa070-20f3-11ec-befd-dcadfb6693aa" alt="Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver&#x002019;s watch" data-uuid="491c4b5f-d67e-3594-8c20-f908a85d5f2f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Withings told Engadget that FDA approval of its ECG health sensor is holding back the ScanWatch Horizon&#39;s release in the US, but it&#39;s hoping to bring it stateside by the end of the year. That&#39;s also why the original ScanWatch has yet to go on sale in the US, in case you were wondering.&nbsp;</p><p>As for when you can get one of these on your wrist, the ScanWatch Horizon will first launch in the UK from September 29th, priced at £499.95 / €499.95. Buyers will be able to choose the Blue or Green face color, and both models will ship with a quick-release stainless steel and an FKM rubber band (for swimming). It also arrives today in France and Germany, and you can expect it to pop up a bit later elsewhere in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Steve Dent contributed to this report.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-horizon-divers-watch-070020840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69f9d14b-3a4b-4faf-94cc-10ba0f22a8af</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper,Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 07:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632901575</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T07:46:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d616d660-20f5-11ec-b697-d45dd503a34a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d616d660-20f5-11ec-b697-d45dd503a34a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hands-on image of the Withings ScanWatch Horizon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Withings ScanWatch Horizon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arturia announces MiniFuse lineup of affordable audio interfaces]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arturia already has a lineup of audio interfaces. They&#39;re fairly well regarded. But one thing they&#39;re not, is cheap. The base model <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/audiofuse/overview">AudioFuse</a> is $699. It is <em>not</em> for the casual bedroom producer. But, the company knows that the more people making music, the bigger its customer base, so serving that entry level is important. The MiniFuse line is the answer to that need.&nbsp;</p><p>The lineup of three models starts at $99 for the <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse1#en">MiniFuse 1</a>. It&#39;s the most basic of the new devices with a single combo input for XLR and 1/4-inch instruments. But it has the same preamps, 110db dynamic range, five-year warranty and software bundle as the rest of the lineup. All the MiniFuses can also act as USB hubs, so you can connect a controller through the interface and save some port space on your PC. What you lose mostly by opting for the most affordable option is the MIDI in and out ports. You also can&#39;t blend direct monitoring with the USB output, you can only switch between the two.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="64f8080fcfc64f3a9e55920f17389f94"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pe04RI1erIQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The $149 <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse2#en">MiniFuse 2</a> adds a second input, MIDI in and out ports and has a mix control for balancing between direct monitoring of your input and what&#39;s coming out of your PC. This is handy for recording live audio when even the tiniest of latency is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse4#en">MiniFuse 4</a> hasn&#39;t gotten a price tag yet, and wont be shipping until next year. But it has line inputs around the back, two additional audio outputs and an additional headphone jack so you and a collaborator can both monitor a track together without filling your recording space with more noise. If you use a decent amount of outboard gear or frequently work with a vocalist this is probably the way to go. The extra outputs and inputs are especially handy for routing audio out of your computer, processing it with external effects then running it back into your DAW for final mixing.&nbsp;</p><p>The MiniFuse line comes with a solid bundle of software including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton Live</a> Lite, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-8-analog-lab-v-hands-on-softsynth-vst-173441647.html">Analog Lab</a> Intro, a bundle of four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-fx-collection-2-22-plugins-youll-actually-use-vst-170115595.html">Arturia FX</a>, Native Instruments Guitar Rig 6 LE and three month subscriptions to both Auto-Tune Unlimited and Splice.</p><p>The MiniFuse 1 and MiniFuse 2 are available to pre order now and will start shipping in November.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-announces-mini-fuse-lineup-of-affordable-audio-interfaces-204411420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aea789a7-9ec6-414a-af7e-226046d23733</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 22:55:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864206</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix buys 'Oxenfree' developer Night School Studio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The team behind hit indie game <em>Oxenfree </em>is joining Netflix, marking the first time the streaming giant has acquired a game developer.

Lucid Motors said it has <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-starts-production-deliveries-begin-october">started</a> production of the luxury EV and expects to deliver the first Dream Edition models in late October. There will only be 520 Dream units (conveniently a match for the car&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html">520-mile estimated range</a>). However, Lucid won&#39;t be hurting for early customers. Even if only some of the 13,000 reservation holders commit to a purchase, that&#39;s a significant volume for an upscale car from a relatively new brand.</p><p>Those numbers might climb. The fledgling automaker plans a rapid expansion that will add about 65 acres (2.85 million square feet) to its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. It may need the extra output, too. Lucid plans to mass-produce its first SUV, the Gravity, in 2023, and electric SUVs have lately been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2020-production-half-million-cars-154826010.html">in high demand</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Air starts at $77,400. In addition to its potentially Tesla-beating range, it promises rare perks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Dolby Atmos audio</a>, very quick charging (20 minutes for 300 miles) and a 34-inch cockpit display.</p><p>There&#39;s no guarantee Lucid will succeed when competing against Tesla, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">Rivian</a> and rapidly electrifying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">incumbent car brands</a>. While its strategy is familiar to Tesla fans (its first truly large-scale EV was also a luxury sedan), Lucid is entering a much more established market with competitors that have ample resources and name recognition. With that said, just making it to production is notable feat. EV startups like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/recordbreaking-faraday-future-prototype-evs-auction-211946137.html">Faraday Future</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">Lordstown Motors</a> are still struggling to reach that point, giving Lucid a considerable lead over some of its key rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-delivery-date-214305594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb535e79-c5ae-45a4-9e25-3bc9278b3d6e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 21:43:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864193</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Amazon's entire new hardware event right here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon tends to avoid livestreaming its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hardware-fall-2020-echo-ring-eero-012946012.html">big hardware events</a>, but it&#39;s happy to share video after the fact — and this year&#39;s presentation is one you might want to see.

It&#39;s essentially a tablet on wheels, roughly the size of a small dog, with cameras that allow it to detect anomalies in the house, record video, and send alerts to your phone. It also connects with Ring, Amazon&#39;s popular personal security system, allowing the robot to roll around on its own and proactively investigate odd events while the homeowners are away. Its name is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>. Yes, it has eyes.</p><p>Astro was the cap to an hour-long event that started with kids&#39; toys and health services, and ended in a stream of dystopian police-state devices, each presented with an Amazon-branded smile. There was the smart thermostat, the interactive camera for kids, and Amazon&#39;s own version of the Fitbit, followed by the Ring Always Home Cam, Ring Alarm Pro, Ring Virtual Security Guard, Blink Video Doorbell and floodlight cameras, and finally, Astro, the robot with an extendable arm that can record every inch of your house without any user input. Add a layer of ominous music that slowly creeps up in volume, and Amazon&#39;s show was an instant episode of <em>Black Mirror</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f28bdc20-2099-11ec-9fff-89bbc8de75ac" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="953527f9-3e52-349b-8d60-1ca37bff317c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In Amazon&#39;s vision of the future, homeowners are constantly watching their security cameras, tracking delivery people and spying on their dogs, heavily relying on the Ring ecosystem the entire time. Astro and the Ring Always Home Cam, Amazon&#39;s autonomous security drone, are the company&#39;s most visually striking devices, tapping into science-fiction dreams of robot butlers and AI-powered pets. They move on their own and stream data directly to the homeowner at any time, satiating the persistent breed of home-security paranoia generated by neighborhoods of curbside cameras and Nextdoor threads.</p><p>While the robots are the face of Amazon&#39;s in-home security business, Ring is the backbone. Ring has been leading the home-security charge in the United States since 2018, selling <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005336/en/Strategy-Analytics-Amazons-Ring-Remained-atop-the-Video-Doorbell-Market-in-2020">1.4 million doorbells</a> in 2020 alone and cornering 18 percent of the market overall. Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to be a near-sighted steward of this massive, unregulated residential surveillance system.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2018, Ring has signed agreements with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">more than 2,000 police departments</a> across the US, providing authorities with access to recordings from residential cameras, often without warrants and according to the company&#39;s own parameters. In <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">May and June 2020</a>, for instance, the Los Angeles Police Department used the Ring ecosystem to request footage of Black Lives Matter protests from residential doorbell cameras, without noting a specific incident that was under investigation. That&#39;s a huge red flag, according to activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b141a570-2098-11ec-adbf-6763af19bb94" alt="Ring Always Home Cam" data-uuid="330f0cba-4187-3071-93e9-a2814428f8ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>&quot;If police request hours of footage on either side of a specific incident, they may receive hours of people engaging in First Amendment protected activities with a vague hope that a camera may have captured illegal activity at some point,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">the EFF said</a> in February. The report continued, &quot;Technologies like Ring have the potential to provide the police with video footage covering nearly every inch of an entire neighborhood. This poses an incredible risk to First Amendment rights. People are less likely to exercise their right to political speech, protest, and assembly if they know that police can acquire and retain footage of them. This creates risks of retribution or reprisal, especially at protests against police violence. Ring cameras, ubiquitous in many neighborhoods, create the possibility that if enough people share footage with police, authorities are able to follow protestors’ movements, block by block.&quot;</p><p>As the number of police departments with Amazon contracts has skyrocketed, authorities themselves have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor">pushing Ring devices</a> on the citizens they serve, using materials prepared by the company and earning incentives for getting folks to download Ring&#39;s Neighbors app. Amazon has effectively turned the US police force into its own mini marketing squad, blurring the lines between public safety and private-company loyalty.</p><p>On top of problematic police partnerships, the Ring ecosystem is filled with unchecked bias. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops">2019 study by <em>Motherboard</em></a> found people of color were disproportionately labeled as &quot;suspicious&quot; in the Neighbors app, a phenomenon that feeds into racism and hyper-vigilance, creating less-safe environments overall.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9a92a670-2099-11ec-bf9b-bd87c39b8ae7" alt="Ring" data-uuid="03d13dce-786b-323d-950d-a1469c886462"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Ring has taken steps to address some of these issues, such as changing the wording in the Neighbors app from &quot;suspicious&quot; to &quot;unexpected activity.&quot; Additionally, police will no longer be able to send bulk emails to Ring users who might have footage they want — instead, there&#39;s a portal on Neighbors where they can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-request-for-assistance-posts-100025122.html">request footage publicly</a>. Of course, these aren&#39;t solutions. Changing a word does nothing to temper the breeding ground of suspicion and racism inherent in the Neighbors app, and making police requests public doesn&#39;t stop them from happening, warrantless and with broad boundaries that are still determined by Amazon, a massive ecommerce company.</p><p>&quot;The network is predicated on perpetuating irrational fear of neighborhood crime, often yielding disproportionate scrutiny against people of color, all for the purposes of selling more cameras,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/ring-changed-how-police-request-door-camera-footage-what-it-means-and-doesnt-mean">the EFF said</a> in June. &quot;Ring does so through police partnerships, which now encompass 1 in every 10 police departments in the United States. At their core, these partnerships facilitate bulk requests from police officers to Ring customers for their camera footage, built on a growing Ring surveillance network of millions of public-facing cameras. EFF adamantly opposes these Ring-police partnerships and advocates for their dissolution.&quot;</p><p>As Amazon continues to build out its Ring ecosystem, police partnerships intact, it&#39;s clear that the company is not focused on rebuilding public policy, reducing crime or eliminating everyday racism. Amazon is focused on selling Ring cameras; Amazon is focused on making money. Personally, that doesn&#39;t make me feel safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efa5eb01-d37d-46b7-9b8e-7ed1438dcf8c</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 20:36:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632861702</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T20:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here's everything Amazon announced at its September hardware event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon held its annual fall hardware event on Tuesday. It&#39;s too bad the company didn&#39;t stream the proceedings to the public because it was jam-packed with announcements. We saw everything from new Echo devices to an Alexa-powered robot. But worry not, we have you covered. Here&#39;s everything the company announced today.</p><h2></h2><h2>Astro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcdd26d0-207f-11ec-afff-2ea66d38964e" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="fef8f3a5-e563-32f7-9dbd-45d34201e21a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In an event packed with offbeat products, Amazon saved its most unusual one for last. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>, the company has created an Alexa-powered robot that can move around your home. It has three primary functions. It can provide home security, check-in on loved ones and pets and offer Alexa functionality on the go. When it becomes available later this year, Astro will cost $999.99 before it eventually increases to $1449.99 at a later date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Echo Show 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f804be90-2091-11ec-9bff-700d0016980e" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="c9bee933-525b-3d79-a59d-e880c205ca43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Amazon is adding yet another model to its Echo Show family. Its latest addition features a 15.6-inch 1080p display that the company envisions you mounting on the wall in spaces like your home’s kitchen. New to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">Echo Show 15</a> is a redesigned home screen that emphasizes Alexa widgets. The smart display also features a camera and a new feature that will adjust the contents of the home screen to you when the device recognizes your face. Sales of the $250 Echo Show 15 will start later this year.</p><h2>Halo</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/85668d00-2091-11ec-8778-1184c4ce48dd" alt="Halo View" data-uuid="786b32f3-f7e0-337c-969c-6c3c79eec8c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon had two major announcements related to its Halo fitness product. First, the company introduced its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">Halo View fitness band</a>. In short, Amazon essentially added an AMOLED color display to its Halo wearable and made the resulting device cheaper. It doesn’t come with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-platform-134146361.html">tone-detecting microphone</a> that made the company’s first foray into fitness wearables so controversial, but what it can do is track your heart rate, skin temperature, steps and more. Halo View isn’t available to purchase just yet, but it will cost $80 when it does become available.</p><p>Outside of new hardware, the company announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html">Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition</a>, two new features that will come included with its yearly $80 Halo subscription. The former is an alternative to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Apple Fitness+</a> and other similar services. The latter, meanwhile, includes personalized recipes and meal planning. Halo Fitness will roll out later this year, while Halo Nutrition will arrive at the start of 2022.</p><h2>Ring and Blink</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25224640-2092-11ec-bdee-4e8c924e8725" alt="Blink Doorbell" data-uuid="650becd9-3466-31cd-8849-95bc33ad6c1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon’s Ring and Blink home security subsidiaries had an entire segment dedicated to their products. Highlights from that section include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html">Ring Alarm Pro, a security system that includes Eero Mesh WiFi integration</a>, and Blink’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">$50 video doorbell</a>. Ring also announced it’s starting to accept sign-ups to test its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">Always Home Cam</a> security drone, which it first announced this same time last year.</p><h2>Glow</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11322b10-2091-11ec-9e5f-2106b7bf1699" alt="Amazon Glow" data-uuid="ac09e982-89f5-3607-b613-52a5505fe293"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>The award for the second-most offbeat device Amazon announced at its annual event goes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html">Glow</a>. It’s a teleconferencing display the company designed for kids. Glow includes a projector that can create a 19-inch touch-sensitive playspace for all the games and activities included with the device. Glow will cost $249.99 when it goes on sale in the next few weeks, but Amazon said that&#39;s just an introductory price.</p><h2>All the rest</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ba3a200-2091-11ec-b7fb-a0dfaaf41aa8" alt="Amazon Smart Thermostat" data-uuid="d29e3ccd-a6fd-317d-94ac-b7cf250e3e41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon wouldn’t be Amazon if the company weren’t trying to create more affordable versions of some of the best-selling products on its marketplace. So it should come as no surprise it announced an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Alexa-enabled smart thermostat</a> that only costs $60.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of new hardware, Tuesday’s event saw the company announce various updates for its Alexa. In brief, the company worked with Disney to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">voice assistant</a> that will be available on Echo devices and Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms. It also introduced a feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html">Alexa Together</a> that turns an Echo speaker or smart display into an emergency support device for your family members. Lastly, the company is adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html">offline voice support for Alexa devices</a>.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b0dacb1-3797-4d45-ac38-5c65273643ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:57:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632867565</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T22:19:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Xbox owners can now test cloud gaming on their consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is preparing to complete a large piece of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html">cloud gaming puzzle</a> when it brings the option <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-173404923.html"><ins>to Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S sometime this holiday season</ins></a>. Starting today, though, a random group of Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Insiders can try cloud gaming on their consoles. The test will expand to more Insiders and members of other preview rings in the coming weeks.</p><p>If you have access, you can try cloud gaming by looking for the cloud icon on titles in the Xbox Game Pass library. To see a full list of games you can stream, go to My Games &amp; Apps, then Full Library and Xbox Game Pass, and change the filter to Cloud Gaming. At the outset, you&#39;ll be able to play more than 100 games without having to download them — as long as you have a sturdy enough internet connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="eebe440949f44ed398701543d544aa59"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) for Console is coming to a random subset of Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxInsiders</a> today!

You also can&#39;t make any in-game purchases while playing a cloud gaming title, but you can do so through the Store on your console or the web. Meanwhile, if you have installed a game on an external drive that isn&#39;t connected to your Xbox, you won&#39;t be able to play it over the cloud. That seems like an annoying bug but hey, that&#39;s what beta tests are for.</p><p>Don&#39;t fret too much if you don&#39;t have access just yet. Console cloud gaming should be available for all Game Pass Ultimate subscribers within the next few months, perhaps just in time to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em><ins>Halo Infinite</ins></em></a>.

The next time you deliver a presentation with Keynote, you&#39;ll be able to include live video feeds directly in the slides. You can resize the video feed and change the look with masks, frames, drop shadows and reflections.</p><p>With the Mac version of Keynote, you can add feeds from multiple external cameras, and share a connected iPhone or iPad screen, which could prove useful for interactive demos. There are more collaboration features too. A new multi-presenter function lets anyone control a shared slideshow and advance slides remotely using a Mac, iPhone or iPad. This could come in handy for group presentations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The changes to Pages are largely iPhone-focused. The Screen View feature arranges text, images and other aspects of the document into a single-column view. Apple has increased the text size, while images are sized to fit your phone&#39;s screen. You can also view tables by scrolling left and right. Users will still be able to edit documents as usual when Screen View is active. You don&#39;t need to do anything to set up the feature, and it works with all word processing documents. Apple says you can toggle off Screen View so you can see the proper layout before you&#39;re ready to share or print the document.</p><p>As for Numbers, you can now get to grips with pivot tables across Apple devices. You&#39;ll be able to summarize, group and rearrange data to spot and study trends and patterns. There are options to visualize the pivot tables with charts and to share pivot data without disclosing the source data. You can also import pivot tables from and export them to Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Elsewhere, there&#39;s a new chart type called radar charts. Apple says this &quot;makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables with similarities shown as overlapping areas, allowing differences and outliers to really stand out.&quot; There are new filters you can use to highlight unique entries or duplicate data.</p><p>All three apps now support Apple&#39;s new translation tools on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ios%2015">iOS 15</a>, iPadOS 15 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/macos%20monterey">macOS Monterey</a>. The latest versions of Keynote, Pages and Numbers are now available on the App Store and Mac App Store.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e9d66b20-2087-11ec-bf7f-0ef40271895e" style="height:497;width:653;" alt="The translation feature on Apple&#39;s Keynote app on macOS Monterey" data-uuid="699befaa-fce5-37a7-88c4-7927819a1d4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iwork-keynote-pages-numbers-live-video-182213376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f93913a7-0097-46b3-ad64-a2966bab6482</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:22:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632853337</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T18:22:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Loans]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d40824a0-2087-11ec-bedf-251f8d2bd710" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d40824a0-2087-11ec-bedf-251f8d2bd710" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iWork apps Keynote, Numbers and Pages]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iWork apps Keynote, Numbers and Pages]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft's Windows store is now open to third-party app stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft wasn&#39;t just indulging in wishful thinking when it said it wanted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wants-steam-epic-in-windows-11-app-store-132411163.html">more third-party app stores</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11&#39;s</a> portal. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698196/microsoft-store-third-party-app-stores-epic-games-amazon">notes</a> that new Microsoft Store <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">policies</a> now allow third-party storefront apps.

It can pitch Windows 11&#39;s store as a more open alternative to Apple&#39;s Mac App Store, even if Mac users don&#39;t have any real trouble accessing the EGS and other storefronts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-store-open-to-third-party-stores-175600113.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fded746f-7947-4d4b-92ee-2e7d346cfec2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 17:56:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632851763</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:56:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b7e1bd10-2080-11ec-b96f-a97ae4cf3b34" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b7e1bd10-2080-11ec-b96f-a97ae4cf3b34" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 showing Epic Games Store inside Microsoft Store]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 showing Epic Games Store inside Microsoft Store]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alexa Together turns your loved one's Echo into an emergency support device]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2020-alexa-breathing-teach-voice-profiles-for-kids-172918631.html">announced Alexa Care Hub</a>, a free service that uses Alexa to let people check in on family members. The so-called &quot;caregiver&quot; can see notifications and alerts when someone uses Alexa as a way of letting you know that someone they want to keep an eye on is up and about. It also lets the &quot;care receiver&quot; say &quot;Alexa, call for help&quot; and it&#39;ll contact the caregiver immediately. Amazon didn&#39;t charge for this, but today it&#39;s adding a new feature called Alexa Together to the service. It&#39;ll be a $20/month service that gives an aging family member 24/7 access to Urgent Response, which Amazon describes as a professional emergency help line.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa Together will also make caregiving easier to share among multiple family members by letting multiple people be designated as support contacts for a single individual. Other features include support for third-party devices that can detect when someone has fallen at home, the ability to add contacts to an individual&#39;s Alexa account so they can make hands-free calls, and set reminders on someone else&#39;s device or link up a music service for them to play tunes through.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At a high level, it sounds like Alexa Together basically makes it easier for other people to manage a family member&#39;s Alexa-capable device so they use it more. And if they use it more, the caregiver will see that it&#39;s being used and know their family member is going about their normal day. It&#39;s a bit convoluted, but the 24/7 access to Urgent Response might be worth the $20 per month cost. Alexa Together will have a free six-month trial period (or one full year if you&#39;ve been using the Alexa Care Hub already) when it launches later this year.</p><div id="8d1e8626509643b48f8094a85a055d0f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alexa Together is designed to help aging family members feel more comfortable and confident living independently, and to give the entire family peace of mind.
