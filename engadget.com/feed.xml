As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/18/gurman-iphone-13-apple-watch-always-on/">notes</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman used his weekly &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> to say the 2021 iPhone will potentially have an &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Apple Watch</a>-like&quot; always-on display with better battery life in addition to a 120Hz refresh rate, a smaller screen notch, an A15 chip and video recording upgrades.</p><p>Gurman didn&#39;t outline the always-on screen functionality. However, a past leak from Max Weinbach suggested Apple would use an LTPO (low-temperature polycrystalline oxide) panel that, like on the Apple Watch and a few Android phones, could drop to extremely low refresh rates to offer persistent information without a large hit to battery life. You might see some notifications, battery life and the clock without having to wake up your phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The writer also used his newsletter to narrow the time frame for a long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">MacBook Pro redesign</a>. He now expects Apple to start mass production of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">mini LED</a>-equipped laptops in the third quarter of 2021 (aka this summer) with a launch between September and November. That&#39;s still somewhat vague, but it does suggest you won&#39;t have to wait until next year (or watch for a surprise early announcement).</p><p>The new MacBook Pros are rumored to have a &#39;flat&#39; design like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the new iMac</a> (minus the colors) while using a more powerful take on Apple&#39;s M1 chip that could support up to 64GB of RAM and more ports. Mini LEDs could deliver a screen that offers high contrast ratios and brightness while keeping battery life in check.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12s-always-on-display-leak-164539339.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e3e05f5-dba8-4379-8c1f-cab7b3cb91f2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 16:45:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626626742</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T16:45:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da2eba60-e7e3-11eb-bcbe-053ea084ddce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da2eba60-e7e3-11eb-bcbe-053ea084ddce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max display with multitasking in view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max display with multitasking in view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook rejects Biden claim it's 'killing people' with COVID-19 misinformation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook isn&#39;t exactly enthusiastic about President Biden&#39;s claim that it and other social networks are &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">killing people</a>&quot; by allowing COVID-19 misinformation to spread. The social media firm <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/support-for-covid-19-vaccines-is-high-on-facebook-and-growing/">posted</a> a refutation of the allegations, using data to suggest that something other than Facebook was responsible for a slowdown in vaccination rates and a rise in cases.</p><p>The company noted that vaccine acceptance in user polling had risen from 70 percent in January 2021 to as high as 85 percent in July, and that cultural group disparities had declined &quot;considerably&quot; over the same period. This was ahead of Biden&#39;s goal of getting 70 percent of Americans vaccinated by July — to Facebook, this was a sign the company was &quot;not the reason&quot; the US fell short of that target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook added that Canada and the UK had higher vaccination percentages despite using the social network about as much as their American counterparts. There&#39;s &quot;more than Facebook&quot; to the US results, the company said. It also pointed to its efforts to both promote <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-covid-19-forecasts-160038962.html">accurate claims</a> and fight falsehoods, including the use of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-notifications-harmful-coronavirus-misinformation-191233820.html">misinformation labels</a>, reduced exposure and takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>The internet giant didn&#39;t attempt to find an alternate explanation for US troubles. Some observers have <a href="https://twitter.com/NGrossman81/status/1416724328591282176">pointed</a> to a possible link between political affiliation and vaccination rates, but Facebook didn&#39;t even hint at this in its refutal.</p><p>It&#39;s not a flawless argument. Facebook is trying to draw a link between its polling data and the entire US, which doesn&#39;t make for a neat and tidy comparison. The company also hasn&#39;t shared estimates of how much COVID-19 misinformation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">slips through the cracks</a>. The social site has a strong incentive to downplay its possible contribution to the problem given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html">past complaints</a> that it hasn&#39;t done enough to stop misinformation campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the data shifts the attention back to the Biden administration — it may need to provide more substantial data if it&#39;s going to show that health misinformation on social networks like Facebook is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html">major threat</a>, as the US Surgeon General recently said. If nothing else, it suggests the answer is a complicated one regardless of how much Facebook is responsible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-rejects-biden-covid-19-misinformation-154349002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a0aa434-f1e1-4b9a-99d1-f045fca245f7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 15:43:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626623031</ingested><modified>2021-07-18T15:44:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d5a66660-e7d3-11eb-9bd9-d8855d9d0e47" width="6095" height="4064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A teenage student receives a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during a vaccination event for local adolescents and adults outside the Bronx Writing Academy school in the Bronx borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 4, 2021.

The fiber optic line had four cores instead of one, and researchers fired a 552-channel comb laser at multiple wavelengths with the assistance of rare earth amplifiers.

The NICT researchers envision their next-gen fiber making technologies &quot;beyond 5G&quot; (like 6G) more practical.

To verify their finding, the researchers created a custom USB device, which they loaded with infrared photos of the user and RGB images of Spongebob.

Tech companies need to ensure their authentication technologies are secure if they want to rely more and more on biometrics and to move away from passwords as a means of authentication.

Published by Park Row Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Coffee and tea are much more potent sources of caffeine than soda. In one cup of coffee, you are likely to ingest around 100 mg of caffeine, but it can be up to 175 mg with the right coffee beans and technique. The whole process of making coffee beans (and coffee itself) is pretty fascinating if you’ve never given it much thought. For example, espresso makers and percolators get the most caffeine out of lighter roasted beans, but the drip method is the best way to get the most trimethylxanthine from darker beans. However, in general, light and dark roast coffees typically have the same relative number of caffeine molecules in each cup of coffee (excluding espressos).</p><p>Let’s look at the roasting processes to determine why that is. When the beans are initially heated, they absorb energy in what we call an endothermic process. However, at around 175°C (347°F), the process suddenly becomes exothermic. This means that the beans have absorbed so much heat that they now radiate the heat back into the atmosphere of the roasting machine. When this happens, the settings have to be adjusted on the equipment, in order to avoid over-roasting the beans (which sometimes results in burnt-tasting coffee). Some roasters will even toggle the beans between the endothermic and exothermic reaction a couple of times, to achieve different flavors.</p><p>Over time, roasting coffee beans slowly change from green to yellow, and then to a number of different shades of brown. We refer to the darkness of the bean as its “roast,” where the darker roasted coffee beans are much darker in color than the lighter roasted beans (surprise, surprise). Their color comes from the temperature at which they are roasted. Lighter beans are heated to about 200°C (392°F) and darker roasted beans to about 225–245°C (437–473°F).</p><p>But just before the beans start to, for lack of better words, lightly roast, the coffee beans go through their first “crack.” This is an audible process that occurs at 196°C (385°F). During this process, the beans absorb heat and double in size. But since the water molecules evaporate out of the bean when under high temperatures, they actually decrease in mass by about 15%.</p><p>After the first crack, the coffee beans are so dry that they stop readily absorbing heat. Instead, all of the thermal energy is now used to caramelize the sugars on the outside of the coffee bean. This means that the heat is used to break the bonds in the sucrose (sugar) into much smaller (and more fragrant) molecules. The lightest roasts—like cinnamon roast and New England roast—are heated just past the first crack before being removed from the coffee roaster.</p><p>There is a second crack that occurs during the roast, but at a much higher temperature. At 224°C (435°F), the coffee beans lose their structural integrity, and the bean itself starts to collapse. When this happens, you can usually hear it by a second “pop.” Dark roasts are typically categorized by any beans that have been heated past the second crack—like French and Italian roasts. In general, due to the hotter temperatures, darker beans tend to have more of their sugars caramelized, while lighter beans have less. The variation in flavor due to these methods is wild, but it doesn’t really affect how they react in the body— only the taste.</p><p>Once you purchase your perfectly roasted coffee beans, you can do the rest of the chemistry at home. With an inexpensive coffee grinder, you can grind up your coffee beans to a number of different sizes, which will definitely affect the taste of your morning coffee. Small, fine grinds have a lot of surface area, which means the caffeine (and other flavors) can be extracted from the miniaturized coffee beans with ease. However, this can often result in too much caffeine being extracted, which gives the coffee a bitter taste.</p><p>On the other hand, coffee beans can be coarsely ground. In this instance, the insides of the coffee beans are not exposed to nearly the same degree as finely ground coffee beans. The resulting coffee can often taste sour—and sometimes even a little salty. But if you partner up the correct size of coffee grounds with the appropriate brewing method, you can make yourself the world’s best cup of coffee.</p><p>The simplest (and easiest way) to brew coffee is to add extremely hot water to coarse coffee grounds. After they have soaked in the water for a few minutes, the liquid can be decanted from the container. This process, called decoction, uses hot water to dissolve the molecules within the coffee beans. Most current methods of coffee brewing utilize some version of decoction, which is what allows us to drink a cup of warm coffee instead of chomping on some roasted beans. However, since this method does not contain a filtration process, this version of coffee—affectionately referred to as cowboy coffee—is prone to having coffee bean floaters. For that reason, it’s usually not the preferred brewing method.</p><p>By the way, did you notice that I was avoiding the term <em>boiling</em>? If you’re trying to make halfway decent cup of coffee, the hot water should never actually be boiled. Instead, the ideal temperature of the water is around 96°C (205°F), which is just below boiling (100°C, 212°F). At 96°C, the molecules that provide the aroma of coffee begin to dissolve. Unfortunately, when the water is just four degrees hotter, the molecules that give coffee a bitter taste dissolve as well. That’s why coffee nerds and baristas are so obsessed with their water temperature. In my house, we even use an electric kettle that allows us to select whatever temperature we want our water to be.</p><p>Depending on how strong you like your coffee to taste, you may be partial to the French press or another steeping method. Like cowboy coffee, this technique also soaks the coffee grounds in hot water, but these grounds are a little smaller (coarse versus extra coarse). After a few minutes, a plunger is used to push all of the grounds to the bottom of the device. The remaining liquid above the grounds is now perfectly clear and deliciously tasty. Since the coarse coffee grounds are used in this method, more molecules can dissolve in the coffee solution, providing us with a more intense flavor (compared to cowboy coffee).</p><p>Another technique: when hot water is dripped over coffee grounds, the water absorbs the aromatic molecules before dripping into the coffee mug. This process, appropriately called the drip method, can be done manually or with a high-tech machine, like a coffee percolator. But sometimes this technique is used with cold water, which means that the fragrant, aromatic molecules (the ones that give your coffee its distinctive smell) cannot dissolve in the water. The result is called Dutch iced coffee, a drink that is ironically favored in Japan, and takes about two hours to prepare.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-its-elemental-kate-biberdorf-harper-collins-153015871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7577aec-08c0-4596-bd2d-c7bef8b9bceb</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626281241</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T16:56:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/af90ad30-6242-11eb-bbbf-066a2bd61ce2" width="6445" height="4297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nando Martinez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casual young black woman taking a relaxing cup of coffeee in the kitchen at home.

There are those who see it as a nice thing to do with your family once in a while, and there are those who take it… a little more seriously. The upcoming <em>Behind the Attraction</em>, hitting <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/BXx1B0">Disney+</a> on July 21st, is a show that’s aimed at turning more of those casual tourists into dedicated fans, by explaining the backstory behind famous attractions like Star Tours, the Haunted Mansion and Space Mountain.</p><p>Each episode features lots of old footage, talking heads, conceptual art and snark. If you’re thinking that sounds like <em>The Toys That Made Us</em>, but for Disney Parks, you’d be absolutely correct. <em>Behind the Attraction</em> is produced and directed by Brian Volk-Weiss, the creative mind behind Netflix docuseries like <em>TTTMU</em> and <em>The Movies That Made Us</em>. He was specifically sought out by Disney+ for his style which, by his own description, is “focused more on fun” and doesn’t treat its subject like “the rise and fall of the Roman Empire.” He loves documentaries, but hates when they take silly topics too seriously.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37f7cb60-e4d7-11eb-b6ef-43e993965012" style="height:2000;width:2964;" alt="Hippos in the river at Jungle Cruise" data-uuid="231dcba6-bc28-35e7-b5d5-a29d7754bbac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>To wit, the series is narrated by comedy veteran Paget Brewster, an actress who has been in <em>The Venture Bros.</em>, <em>Community</em> and <em>Another Period</em>. Disney fans will probably recognize her best as the voice of Della Duck on the 2017 <em>DuckTales</em> reboot. She adopts a light playful tone, as far from Morgan Freeman you can get. Also on board is executive producer Dwayne Johnson, who stars in Disney’s upcoming live action <em>Jungle Cruise</em> film. Is there an episode about the Jungle Cruise attraction? Of course there is.</p><p>Besides that, the other four episodes available this week focus on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-06-disney-worlds-haunted-mansion-gets-interactive-upgrade-digital.html">Haunted Mansion</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20wars">Star Tours</a>, The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and Space Mountain. (Episodes about things like the castles and transportation systems, as well as famous rides like “It’s a Small World” and Pirates of the Caribbean are being held for later in the year.) They trace the history and development of each individual attraction with clips from shows like 1955’s <em>Disneyland</em> and <em>The Wonderful World of Disney</em>, news segments, and a mix of new and old interviews. Anyone who watched the docuseries <em>The Imagineering Story</em> (also on Disney+) will recognize a lot of reused footage from there. Which of course begs the question, why did we need another behind-the-scenes show?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/97bed660-e4d7-11eb-bdbe-b70faa2ae09d" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="Star Tours / Galaxy&#39;s Edge" data-uuid="22114616-25c4-32aa-8b83-2ecb37dd4de7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>The biggest difference between the two is that <em>The Imagineering Story</em> takes a strict chronological approach, starting with the origin story behind Walt Disney’s desire to build a theme park, progressing through the opening of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disneyland">Disneyland</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/walt%20disney%20world">Walt Disney World</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epcot">Epcot</a> and so on. The later episodes focus less on a historical outlook and more on “look at what cool technology we built for this new thing.” Which leads to a sort of unbalanced feel to the program, as well as a greater sense that it’s one big travel brochure for the Disney Parks.</p><p>Which isn’t to say that <em>Behind the Attraction</em> isn’t one big advertisement. I certainly want to visit Disney Shanghai after getting a look at the development of its Storybook Castle and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tron">TRON</a> Lightcycle Power Run. But because the new show takes a more topical approach, it’s a lot more “snackable,” with episodes that can be watched in any order according to what interests you the most.&nbsp;</p><p>Each episode still follows its individual subject chronologically, like how the Hall of Presidents episode goes into the development of the original “Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln” show at the 1964 World’s Fair to the installation of the attraction at Disneyland, the creation of the full Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World to today’s animatronics like the ones used on Avengers Campus at California Adventure. <em>The Imagineering Story</em> talks about the development of the “Stuntronics” as well, but it’s <em>Behind the Attraction</em> that draws a straight line for the viewer from Abraham Lincoln giving a speech to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-animatronic-spider-man-disneyland.html">Spider-Man doing somersaults</a> in the air. You actually understand how tech created in 1964 can still shape something built in 2020.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/23ae4590-e4d6-11eb-bd37-140c5cb5a6e1" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Ghost hitchhikers in the Haunted Mansion" data-uuid="f5484519-bf52-367f-a578-de5f58459a52"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney Parks</div></figure><p>While it&#39;s unlikely that <em>Behind the Attraction</em> will ever delve into the various faceplants the company has taken over the years the way YouTube shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/YesterworldEntertainment/"><em>Yesterworld</em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Defunctland/"><em>Defunctland</em></a> do, the new show is at least capable of admitting when certain things didn’t work. The Haunted Mansion had to be completely rethought for Shanghai, while Japan got a different backstory for its Tower of Terror. And the original Jungle Cruise had no dad jokes!</p><p>Of course, there are no Splash Mountain or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-29-captain-eo-is-back.html">Captain EO</a> episodes, so we don’t know yet how the show will deal with some of the more unsavory or embarrassing bits of Disney Park history. Which is fine, since <em>Behind the Attraction</em> isn’t intended to be a complete history of Disney, just a quick half-hour show that will have you going “did you know?” to all your friends and family the next time you visit the Magic Kingdom.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-behind-the-attraction-review-130039942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ec293c5-1dbf-4fb7-a1b3-afb2536606e7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 13:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626291864</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:44:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel Destinations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35433d40-e4d8-11eb-b93f-282420fee3c7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35433d40-e4d8-11eb-b93f-282420fee3c7" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney Parks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cinderella's Castle at dusk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cinderella's Castle at the Magic Kingdom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon convinces Apple to remove review analyzer Fakespot from the App Store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fakespot, an app that analyzes Amazon reviews to determine which ones are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-27-ftc-cracks-down-on-fake-amazon-reviews-in-landmark-case.html">fake</a>, is no longer available for iOS. Amazon has successfully convinced Apple to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/apple-removes-fakespot-from-app-store-after-amazon-complains.html">remove</a> it from the App Store after the company raised concerns that the application provides misleading information and creates potential security vulnerabilities. The e-commerce giant has confirmed to <em>Engadget</em> that it reported Fakespot for investigation. One of its biggest concerns, Amazon told us, was that the redesigned app Fakespot launched in June &quot;wraps&quot; and injects code into its website.</p><p>&quot;Wrapping&quot; would make it possible, in theory, for the app to collect data and put customers&#39; sensitive information, including credit card numbers, at risk. The e-commerce titan told us it got in touch with Fakespot directly to address its security concerns and that the app developer didn&#39;t take action.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Amazon works hard to build a shopping experience that delights customers, and a selling experience that empowers brands and sellers to build and grow their business. The app in question provides customers with misleading information about our sellers and their products, harms our sellers’ businesses, and creates potential security risks. We appreciate Apple’s review of this app against its Appstore guidelines.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Fakespot founder and CEO Saoud Khalifah has admitted to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/16/apple-removes-fakespot-from-app-store-after-amazon-complains.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> that his company collects some user data, but he said that it doesn&#39;t sell information to third parties. Further, he denies Amazon&#39;s claim that the app presents security risks. &quot;We don&#39;t steal users&#39; information, we&#39;ve never done that. They&#39;ve shown zero proof and Apple acted on this with zero proof,&quot; he told the publication. Apparently, Apple didn&#39;t give his company adequate warning before the app was taken down and didn&#39;t even give it a chance to rectify any issue the tech giant may have.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple has yet to issue a statement that would clarify why exactly Fakespot was pulled down, Amazon pointed <em>Engadget</em> to two App Store guidelines, in particular. One of those guidelines states that an app that displays content from a third-party service must secure permission from that service. The other prohibits applications from displaying false information.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in early 2020, Amazon went after another add-on used to track prices and discount: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-10-amazon-paypal-honey-security-risk.html">Honey</a>, a $4 billion PayPal acquisition. People using Honey saw a warning on Amazon&#39;s website that said the extension &quot;tracks [their] private shopping behavior, collects data like [their] order history and items saved, and can read or change any of [their] data on any website [they] visit.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 07/17/21 10:50AM ET: </strong>A spokesperson told us Apple reached out to Fakespot weeks before pulling it from the App Store, contradicting Khalifah&#39;s claim that his company didn&#39;t get adequate warning. The Apple spokesperson said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This was a dispute over intellectual property rights initiated by Amazon on June 8 and within hours we ensured both parties were in contact with one another, explaining the issue and steps for the developer to take to keep their app on the store and giving them ample time to resolve the issue. On June 29, we again reached out to Fakespot weeks before removing their app from the App Store.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fakespot-app-store-033147651.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ae1bffb6-a912-4676-aec6-25553b115e99</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jul 2021 03:31:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626533900</ingested><modified>2021-07-17T14:58:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f7522110-e6a1-11eb-bfff-edb16fd0a4d3" width="6720" height="3780" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f7522110-e6a1-11eb-bfff-edb16fd0a4d3" width="6720" height="3780" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alexsl via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[London, UK - 03 05 2021: Apple iPhone 8 screen with Online shopping e-commerce mobile app icons applications Amazon, Ebay, AliExpress, Wish etc.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Online shopping e-commerce mobile app icons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM warns not to park Chevy Bolt EVs indoors after two recently caught fire]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Owners of 2017 to 2019 Chevrolet Bolt EVs should not park their cars indoors or leave them to charge overnight unattended, according to a safety alert issued by <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/consumer-alert-important-chevrolet-bolt-recall-fire-risk"><ins>The National Highway Traffic Administration</ins></a> (NHTSA).

According to NHTSA, the batteries in the vehicles included in the safety warning can smoke and catch fire.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the US, GM recalled nearly 51,000 Bolt EVs. The company pushed an update to those cars that limited their batteries to 90 percent of a full charge. More recently, GM said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-battery-recall-software-195939173.html"><ins>install diagnostic software</ins></a> on those cars to prevent future fires. It also promised to assess and replace batteries that featured any “anomalies.” Notably, at the same time, it also removed the charging cap it had implemented when it originally recalled the Bolt.</p><p>Part of the reason the ongoing reports of Bolt fires are a cause for concern is due to the fact the 2017 to 2019 models use the same cells at the center of a similar issue with the Hyundai Kona.

As with its past releases, the startup plans to first sell the food to restaurants, with supermarket availability to follow later. But before all that, it will debut them at a trade show next week.</p><p>One thing that will distinguish the nuggets from Impossible’s past products is the absence of <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/ca/heme"><ins>heme</ins></a>, a molecule the company says is what makes “meat taste like meat.” But the problem with Impossible’s heme is that the company makes it with <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/ca/blog/how-gmos-can-save-civilization-and-probably-already-have"><ins>genetically engineered yeast</ins></a>. That’s something that has prevented Impossible from selling its burgers and sausages in China and throughout Europe. But when it comes to real chicken, there isn’t a lot of heme in the white meat of the animal. “We found in a nugget format, which is breaded and has some seasoning, it really wasn’t that necessary.” Laura Kilman, a flavor scientist with Impossible, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. The formula the company eventually settled on mostly makes use of soy protein and sunflower oil.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-kfc-beyond-fried-chicken-popular.html"><ins>Compared to Beyond Meat</ins></a>, Impossible Foods is late to offer a chicken alternative. “We’ve been busy with other things,” Dennis Woodside, the company’s president, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. To that point, Impossible introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-impossible-pork-taste-test.html"><ins>pork substitute at CES 2020</ins></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All the same, that might not matter much.

The latter sparked a “war” between fast food chains as demand for chicken increased in the US and throughout the world. That&#39;s something that could help Impossible when its plant-based chicken starts making its way to consumers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-chicken-nuggets-190923352.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f11e52bb-dcfa-44f4-a77e-3b45df795d41</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 19:09:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626462566</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T19:09:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44a148e0-e668-11eb-bfbd-fd6583f9cd21" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44a148e0-e668-11eb-bfbd-fd6583f9cd21" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Impossible Foods]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Impossible Foods chicken nuggets]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Impossible Foods chicken nuggets]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max hit record low of $449 at Adorama]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s a lot to love about Apple&#39;s AirPods Max, but their high price tag isn&#39;t one of them.

They have an eye-catching design, but it doesn&#39;t impede their comfort — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">we liked</a> their breathable mesh fabric and large ear cups. They also have a rotating crown of sorts for onboard controls, and while that may be unfamiliar to some, it&#39;s quite reliable and easy to use.</p><p>AirPods Max sound more natural than other headphones we&#39;ve tested, and they have bass that&#39;s prominent but not overpowering. While we prefer the ANC quality of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/3Bb9OxQ">Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4</a>, AirPods Max can hold their own, blocking out most environmental noise. And just like other AirPods, the Max have Transparency Mode so you can easily join conversations when you need to and quickly go back to jamming out at your desk with no distractions. While these headphones won&#39;t support Apple&#39;s lossless audio, they do support Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio on iPhones, iPads, Macs and soon, Apple TV as well.</p><p>The kicker for most people when it comes to AirPods of any kind is the H1 chip, which allows them to quickly pair with and switch between Apple devices. The Max has this chip, so you&#39;ll be able to use them to go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac without any hiccups. While the sale price remains high in comparison to competing headphones, a $100 discount is nothing to scoff at. This sale is a good opportunity to grab the AirPods Max at a much friendlier price if you&#39;ve had your eye on them since launch.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-max-sale-100-off-adorama-184943075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60453195-080c-427c-855f-e7537804e2db</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:49:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626461388</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T18:50:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/dd1abe50-cab9-11eb-8cff-bd62f32bad9b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/dd1abe50-cab9-11eb-8cff-bd62f32bad9b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian delays its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV to September]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rivian was supposed to start deliveries of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-cold-weather-testing-171527674.html"><ins>R1T</ins></a> Launch Edition electric pickup truck <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html"><ins>this month</ins></a>, but that won’t be the case.

However, <em>Extraction</em> has had a more complicated development.

Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-day-redesign-easier-sharing/">previewed</a> updates to &quot;hundreds&quot; of characters for the new OS that will also make them more accessible across apps and platforms. In many cases, they&#39;re simply more thoughtful — they don&#39;t make quite so many presumptions about you or the context of using a given emoji.</p><p>To start, there&#39;s a more &#39;universal&#39; pie instead of the pumpkin pie from before (where was this for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-17-android-9-pie-review.html">Android 9</a>?). The bikini emoji doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s being worn. Food emoji like the croissant and shrimp look like they&#39;ve been cooked properly.

From Android 12 onward, apps that support Google&#39;s Appcompat will always support the latest emoji without requiring separate updates. Better emoji functionality is also coming to many of Google&#39;s platforms, including consistent support in Gmail this July, a new emoji picker in Chrome OS the same month and improved functionality in YouTube chats later in 2021. All told, you won&#39;t have to worry so much about missing emoji or other challenges expressing yourself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-emoji-update-170038659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3e3e339-2425-4a85-bedb-b4e396ce4d55</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626441800</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T13:23:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5720080-e633-11eb-b7df-308f113e1711" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5720080-e633-11eb-b7df-308f113e1711" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12 emoji selection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12 emoji selection]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Facebook’s betting $1 billion on creators]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Instagram held its first-ever Creator Week, a virtual event the company described as “a life-changing three days with new feature news and celeb drop-ins.” One of those drop-ins was CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who made a brief appearance to share a message with creators.</p><p>“I think that any good vision of the future has to involve a lot more people being able to make a living by expressing their creativity and by doing things they want to do, rather than things they have to — and having the tools and the economy around them to support their work is critical,” he said. “Our goal is to be the best platform for creators like you to make a living.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This week, Zuckerberg went even farther, announcing that Facebook plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-billion-dollars-creators-instagram-live-streams-gaming-172537889.html">invest $1 billion</a> in creators by the end of 2022. The investment will fund bonus programs, creator funds and other monetization programs to boost all stripes of creators on its platform.</p><div id="97a3043e74eb4e0397818008f98a9e66"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10113607549897721&amp;width=650&amp;show_text=true&amp;appId=205102269555384&amp;height=206" width="650" height="206" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>That Facebook is funneling so much money and resources toward creators is indicative of not just the opportunity the company sees, but how much ground it has to make up.</p><p>For years, Facebook simply didn’t do much for creators. While Instagram has long had its own influencer community, the company has at times tried to limit their reach. Instagram’s founders were reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-filter-review-183023352.html">uncomfortable</a> with the rise of influencers, and introduced an algorithmic feed to ensure users would see more posts from friends and family than brands and businesses.</p><p>While YouTube has offered monetization features for more than a decade, Instagram didn’t offer any kind of revenue sharing feature until last year. And many creators often felt at odds with Instagram. The company’s ever-changing algorithm fueled suspicions that it “shadowbans” or otherwise penalizes users who post too much or about the “wrong” topics.</p><p>“Facebook has been late to the game in terms of supporting the creative community in a meaningful way,” says Qianna Smith Bruneteau, founder of the American Influencer Council, a trade group representing the creator industry.</p><p>But Facebook is now trying to reverse those perceptions. For the past year, the company has been steadily churning out new tools for creators to make money. Since last May alone, the company has introduced a dizzying number of money-making features.</p><p>On Instagram, creators can now make money from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-igtv-commercials-monetization-150000000.html">commercials</a> in IGTV or open their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html">own shops</a>. They can sell badges and products in live streams. On Facebook, they can host paid virtual events, promote fan subscriptions, or sell in-app gifts in live streams or audio rooms. Soon, they’ll be able to start paid newsletters, earn affiliate commission from products their followers buy and participate in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-shops-content-marketplace-190211314.html">branded content marketplace</a>. The company is also launching several new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/">bonus programs</a> that will pay creators for signing up for IGTV ads, creating Reels or meeting live-streaming milestones.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a9defc20-e64f-11eb-b4fc-3b94e6d814e9" alt="Creators can earn bonuses for meeting certain goals." data-uuid="b223570d-f426-33c3-83f3-fbe8e61f8301"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Zuckerberg and other top executives now regularly speak about creators and the opportunity they represent. The company is so eager to win over the creator community it’s promised it won’t take a cut of their earnings until 2023.</p><p>Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in the creator economy, says surging interest in creators is because the industry has gotten so big it’s no longer something platforms can afford to ignore.</p><p>“I think for a long time there was no need to separately think of creators as a distinct segment that was in need of specialized features or funds,” Jin says. “I think what changed is the realization that … these creators’ content is driving a disproportionate amount of activity and engagement on the platforms.”</p><p>That Facebook is late to the creator economy also means the company is facing an incredible amount of competition. TikTok, which has a reputation for a creator-friendly algorithm, just passed 3 billion downloads, the first non-Facebook owned app to do so, according to analytics company <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">Sensor Tower</a>. Users of TikTok, and its Chinese counterpart Duoyin, together spent more than a half billion dollars in the app during the second quarter of 2021, alone. In the United States in 2020, TikTok was significantly ahead of Facebook and Instagram in user engagement, according to App Annie.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e4818370-e64f-11eb-9ffb-532e71b982f4" alt="TikTok is outpacing Facebook in time spent per user." data-uuid="ab8a8909-ad87-3039-b993-6ffb7ea3aae2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">App Annie</div></figure><p>Meanwhile Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest and other platforms are also pouring money into new initiatives for creators. “There&#39;s a limited number of creators and everyone is in competition for them,” Jin says.</p><p>Facebook has offered various explanations for its sudden interest in creators. Zuckerberg has said he wants to help more people “make a living” off Facebook’s services. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri recently said the company was responding to “the shift in power from institutions to individuals across industries.”</p><p>It’s also a major opportunity to shift Facebook’s business away from ads. Though Facebook has promised it won’t take a cut of creators’ earnings for more than a year, that will eventually change (the company hasn’t said what its cut will be, only that it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-creators-earnings-cut-2023-paid-events-newsletters-164341439.html">be “less”</a> than Apple’s 30-percent commission).</p><p>Creators could also provide a massive boost to the company’s push into shopping. Commerce has also been a major focus for the social network, which has already crammed shopping features into nearly every corner of Instagram, and Zuckerberg has said he intends to create “a full-featured commerce platform” across Facebook’s services.</p><p>What’s less clear is just how much creators will be willing to buy-in to Facebook’s vision. While a $1 billion investment will almost certainly fuel more interest in the platform, it’s not clear if it will prompt the kind of content Facebook might be hoping for. Instagram’s Reels, for example, was meant to be the company’s chief TikTok competitor. Yet the company has at times had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html">push creators</a> to post original content there.</p><p>And concerns about Facebook’s algorithms remain, says Bruneteau. “The algorithm should be favorable to creators like it is on TikTok,” she says. “You have these instant influencers on TikTok, who have been able to grow million-plus followings in less than a year. However those same instant influencers who have those accounts have a tendency to have less followers on Instagram.”</p><p>There are signs that Facebook might be willing to address these concerns. Mosseri recently raised eyebrows when he said that Instagram is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html">no longer</a> a photo-sharing app, and that the company was working one ways to insert more recommended content in users’ feeds in order to compete with TikTok.</p><p>But even with a kinder <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works">algorithm</a>, both Bruneteau and Jin caution that creators should be cautious in throwing too many resources into Facebook or any one platform.</p><p>“When creators are building their processes on top of these like centralized platforms, they&#39;re actually creating more value for the underlying platform than they&#39;re able to create for themselves,” Jin says. “At the end of the day you&#39;re strengthening Facebook&#39;s dominance because the more content you put there, the more it attracts consumer users and the more that translates into Facebook revenue and Facebook&#39;s network effects.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f345e92-36e4-4358-92f0-4dc4fcdefde7</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626454580</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T16:56:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Feb 16, 2020 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign, located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters, Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[QuakeCon returns as an online-only event on August 19th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2021 edition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/quakecon"><ins>QuakeCon</ins></a> will take place from August 19th-21st.

For $49.99, they come with slip-resistant soles and plush inner lining that the company says will keep your feet “snug and warm during long gaming sessions. They’re also made from recycled materials. Before you dismiss the slippers as just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-manufacture-project-hazel-rgb-mask-120020874.html">another oddball product</a> from Razer, we’ll point out that there’s a cool story behind them.</p><div id="c5ac5292abdb46e4a338c77947d6f139"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2T-fX227f4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The slippers are part of Razer’s growing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sneki Snek lineup" href="https://fave.co/3z7i8Nu">Sneki Snek lineup</a>. It all started with a doodle one of the company’s designers drew for their newborn child. As these things usually go, Razer fans took to the mascot and started using it in memes. Some even got tattoos of Sneki Snek. It all eventually led to where we are today, with Razer releasing one Sneki Snek product after another.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early in the process, the company decided to work with <a href="https://www.conservation.org/act/protect-an-acre">Conservation International</a> to donate part of the proceeds from each Sneki Snek sale towards saving forests. The company claims each purchase will help save 10 trees in countries like Costa Rica, Madagascar and China. Razer hopes to help save 1 million trees eventually. With each 100,000 milestone, the company has released a new Sneki Snek product. Previous releases include an adorable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:plushie" href="https://fave.co/3ihhSVp">plushie</a> “optimized for cuddles” and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:head pillow" href="https://fave.co/3klLdk6">head pillow</a> that “fits most gaming chairs.”</p><p>You can buy the Sneki Snek Slippers on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer&#x002019;s website" href="https://fave.co/3zjRilt">Razer’s website</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-sneki-snek-slippers-162234774.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ed5933c-689f-4019-981e-7b9ed6c63874</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 16:22:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626452892</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T16:28:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/88a4dc90-e650-11eb-bed4-c7cbdc986487" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/88a4dc90-e650-11eb-bed4-c7cbdc986487" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sneki Snek slippers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sneki Snek slippers]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
