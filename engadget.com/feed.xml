As <em>Game Developer</em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/culture/activision-blizzard-workers-say-company-broke-federal-labor-law-in-nlrb-complaint">reports</a>, Activision Blizzard workers and the Communication Workers of America have filed a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/31-CA-282822">complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board accusing the game developer of using coercion (such as threats) and interrogation. While the filing doesn&#39;t detail the behavior, the employee group ABetterABK <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1437809134372491273">claimed</a> Activision Blizzard tried to intimidate staff talking about forced arbitration for disputes.</p><p>Companies sometimes include employment clauses requiring arbitration in place of lawsuits. The approach typically favors businesses as arbitrations are often quicker than lawsuits, deny access to class actions and, most importantly, keep matters private. Work disputes are less likely to reach the public eye and prompt systemic change. Tech firms like Microsoft have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-19-microsoft-ends-arbitration-for-sexual-harassment-claims.html">ended arbitration</a> for sexual harassment claims precisely to make sure those disputes are transparent and prevent harassers from going unchecked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear how Activision Blizzard intends to respond.

mini]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple kicked off its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021">hardware event</a> today by revealing two updated iPads that improve upon existing models. The base, 10.2-inch iPad may look the same as the previous version, but it packs better performance and a more advanced camera. The new iPad mini, on the other hand, has been completely redesigned to look like a smaller iPad Pro. Here&#39;s how you can pre-order both the new 10.2-inch iPad and the new iPad mini.</p><h2>10.2-inch iPad</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4fce1ae0-157f-11ec-bebd-f36a5a79a927" alt="Apple 10.2-inch iPad" data-uuid="2c6cf36e-9db1-3211-aa99-3a19989f03b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The updated <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2">10.2-inch iPad</a> is available to pre-order today from Apple starting at $329 and will be widely available on September 24.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-10-2" id="93bd38a7997c4a72b449f1be1cba3d33" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy iPad at Apple starting at $329</a><p>Similarly to last year, Apple focused on updating the internals of this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-a13-bionic-171718680.html">iPad</a> rather than its design. Inside is a A13 Bionic chipset with neural engine, which the company claims will provide 20 percent better performance than the previous tablet. The other major update is the new 12MP ultra wide, front-facing camera that supports Apple&#39;s Center Stage feature. This allows the camera to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in focus during video calls even as you move around. Apple debuted this feature on the latest iPad Pros and now even those opting for the most budget-friendly iPad can get that advanced feature.</p><p>The base iPad still has 10.2-inch Retina display but it now supports TrueTone, which will make it easier on the eyes. It still has a physical Home button on its bottom edge and it still supports the first-generation Apple Pencil for those that want to doodle and take notes with the tablet. Notably, the base configuration comes with double the storage than the previous model — 64GB instead of 32GB — which was a much-needed update.</p><h2>iPad mini</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70e5a0d0-158a-11ec-bfbb-2cb219e8ad36" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="b7f9dc47-3cae-39df-8507-86cc9596b314"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The updated <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini">iPad mini</a> is available to pre-order today from Apple starting at $499 and will be widely available on September 24.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-mini" id="4e6e42f62caf466e98db4c25f6e00172" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy iPad mini at Apple starting at $499</a><p>Apple needed to give the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipad-mini-6th-gen-apple-event-home-button-171740845.html">iPad mini</a> some love. The company&#39;s smallest tablet received a minor update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-ipad-mini-review-2019.html">two years ago</a>, and hadn&#39;t received a big update for three years before that. So the 2021 iPad mini represents the biggest change for the compact tablet in roughly five years, and Apple essentially made it look like a tiny version of its iPad Pros. It has an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display that extends almost edge-to-edge, and that means the physical Home button is gone. Apple move its TouchID technology to the top button on this tablet, which makes it similar to the iPad Air. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil and the accessory can magnetically attach to the mini&#39;s side, just as it does with the iPad Pros.</p><p>The new iPad mini also has the 12MP ultra wide, front-facing camera found on the base iPad, which means Center Stage calls will be available on this device, too. The rear camera is a new 12MP shooter with Focus Pixels, True Tone flash and the ability to take Smart HDR photos.</p><p>Inside the iPad mini is the A15 Bionic chip, which has a six-core CPU and a five-core GPU, and Apple promises 40 percent better performance out of this slab than the previous version. It also has the neural engine which makes for more efficient machine-learning experiences. It&#39;ll come in WiFi and WiFi + Cellular versions and it now supports WiFi 6 and 5G connectivity. Another small yet important change is in the iPad mini&#39;s charging method — gone is the old Lightning port, as it&#39;s been replaced with a USB-C port for faster, more efficient charging.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-new-apple-ipad-and-ipad-mini-2021-184818462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd73ecd0-5eb9-455d-9455-890f504803f1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631646048</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T19:00:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a541dd30-158a-11ec-b3bf-fb9f74697eed" width="1960" height="1260" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a541dd30-158a-11ec-b3bf-fb9f74697eed" width="1960" height="1260" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 10.2-inch iPad 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 10.2-inch iPad 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 vs. the competition: Battle of the batteries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>By this time most kids have gone back to school and, here at Engadget, it’s time to get back to the phone grind.

The latest version of iOS adds new features for FaceTime and Messages, smarter notifications and a new LiveText feature.</p><p>With the update, iPhone and iPad owners can take advantage of FaceTime improvements, including the addition of spatial audio and noise reduction features to eliminate distracting background sounds, The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-messages-ios-15-shared-with-you-173052730.html">revamped</a> Messages app adds a new “shared with you” feature that makes it easier to track photos, music and news articles that are shared in chats with a dedicated section for shared content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple is also changing up its notifications, with new tools to control how and when you receive push alerts. New “Focus” modes, allow you to tune out all alerts except for apps and people you specifically want to hear from, and you can set specific profiles for working, sleeping and other activities. These profiles can also change the arrangement of apps on your home screen based on the apps you’re most likely to use throughout the day.</p><p>One of the more intriguing features of iOS 15 is Live Text, which uses the camera to scan your surroundings and surface relevant information. If you point it at a whiteboard, for example, it could pull out the written text for you to share. It could also identify art, landmarks, plants and pets.</p><p>Notably, the initial release won’t include Apple’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html">SharePlay features</a>, which is expected in a later update. The company also recently confirmed it would delay iOS 15’s most controversial features: the planned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html">child safety</a> update that will allow the company to detect illegal child abuse imagery on users’ devices.

Apple&#39;s new phones feature cinematic mode, which can mimic the focus capabilities from professional cameras. It can automatically focus your video scenes on specific subjects — for example, making someone in the foreground look completely clear, while everyone in the background is blurred out. Even better, cinematic mode is smart enough to push focus to someone in the background if a foreground character looks at them. And, of course, you&#39;ll also be able to manually choose focus points if you want.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ec4792b0-1585-11ec-bfca-bdec0b594b19" alt="iPhone 13 cinematic mode" data-uuid="612efe97-23af-3c12-aef3-04340c19e99c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple says cinematic mode is possible thanks to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-174459983.html">iPhone 13&#39;s A15 Bionic processor</a>. As usual, the company claims it&#39;s far faster than competing mobile chips (50-percent better, in this case), which opens the door for entirely new software features. The iPhone 13&#39;s camera also has optical image stabilization tech from last year&#39;s 12 Pro Max, along with far better sensors, all of which help make cinematic mode possible.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s unclear just how advanced cinematic mode is at this point. But if it works as advertised, it could be a major upgrade for home videos and pros looking to shoot with iPhones. Professionals can also take their footage to another level with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>, both of which support ProRes video.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, it looks like cinematic mode could go the way of portrait capabilities, a feature that every smartphone maker will race to replicate.

Tim Cook called the series the &quot;most Pro iPhone ever,&quot; and the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have faster screens, smaller notches and new colors compared to the 12 Pro series.</p><p>Most significantly, Apple is bringing a new Super Retina XDR display with 1,000 nits of brightness for better outdoor reading. The company said this is the brightest screen on iPhone ever, and it&#39;s 25 percent higher than before. It&#39;s also the first time the company&#39;s ProMotion is available on iPhone, bringing adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz to the Pro series. Most phones in the market with similar refresh rates also use adopt adaptive displays to increase speeds for smoother scrolling when you&#39;re doing things that benefit from it more, like scrolling or playing games. When you&#39;re just looking at static images, the refresh rates drop to as low as 10Hz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the regular and mini iPhone 13s, the Pro series also use the company&#39;s new A15 Bionic chipset that brings improved graphics and neural processing, as well as new video encoder and decoders. With the updated CPU, Apple also added camera features like a Cinematic Mode for video capture, which is powered by machine learning for intelligent focusing on the fly. The Pro models get an improved GPU with five cores, rather than the regular models&#39; four.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bad59da0-1588-11ec-8edb-5cbaa25003de" alt="Apple iPhone 13 Pro cameras" data-uuid="ba03ebe0-7d49-3de7-8fb6-30e6258f9c0a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The company also upgraded the Pro&#39;s camera system, bringing better hardware like a new 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, as well as a new ultrawide setup with autofocus and a larger f/1.8 aperture. This will yield a 92-percent improvement in low light, Apple said. As for the primary &quot;wide&quot; camera, it now features a f/1.5 aperture and 1.9-micron pixels, for what the company said is its largest sensor yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Combined with improved image signal processing through the A15 Bionic chipset, the iPhone 13 Pro cameras can shoot at up to 6x optical zoom with macro photography support as well. For the first time, too, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202410">Apple&#39;s ProRes</a> for full-resolution editing will be supported on the iPhone on this year&#39;s Pro models.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro series also features &quot;the most pro design,&quot; according to the company, and comes in four colors, including a new Sierra Blue hue. Its front has a 20 percent smaller camera system, and stainless steel trim that surrounds the sapphire crystal lenses on the rear triple sensors. It&#39;s also rated IP68 for water resistant, while the internals have been redesigned, like the regular iPhones.</p><p>The A15 Bionic chip is also supposed to bring better battery performance, and the company promised the iPhone 13 Pro Max will last 2.5 hours more than last year&#39;s model, making it the longest-lasting iPhone ever. The iPhone 13 Pro is supposed to see a 1.5 hour boost compared to the iPhone 12 Pro. As for the specifics: the iPhone 13 Pro has a 6.1-inch screen while the Pro Max sports a 6.7-inch display, and they start at $999. The new phones will be available on September 24th, with pre-orders starting Friday the 17th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s iPhone event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1c64d3a-d090-42bb-8fdf-477d02bfc2e1</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 18:08:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631649793</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T20:03:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/22cec560-1586-11ec-bf4a-9fa5ff6216b9" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/22cec560-1586-11ec-bf4a-9fa5ff6216b9" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 13 mini gets camera technology from the 12 Pro Max]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The iPhone mini is staying in Apple&#39;s lineup for at least another year. At its California Streaming event, the company announced its base model iPhone will once again come in two sizes. Like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-174459983.html">bigger sibling</a>, the iPhone 13 mini features the company&#39;s latest system-on-a-chip, the A15 Bionic. The 5nm chip includes a six-core CPU consisting of two high-performance and four high-efficiency cores. The result is a processor that is capable of 15.8 trillion operations per second. Translation: it&#39;s fast.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically, Apple claims battery life is noticeably improved on its latest iPhones. Compared to its predecessor, the company says most users should get an hour and a half of additional battery from the iPhone 13 mini. That increase in uptime comes courtesy of the phone&#39;s A15 Bionic chip, more efficient internal components and software optimizations the company has made under the hood. Given that battery life was one of the few places where the iPhone 12 mini was a disappointment, that&#39;s a major upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unsurprisingly, iPhone 13 mini doesn’t feature the ProMotion display found on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>. Instead, just like its predecessor, it features a 5.4-inch OLED display. However, Apple has redesigned the TrueDepth camera array on both the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini to make it smaller and less obtrusive. According to Apple, the notch is now 20-percent smaller. Additionally, the iPhone 13 mini&#39;s OLED display is 28-percent brighter and features a peak brightness of 1,200 nits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/58093a80-158b-11ec-bf78-96d540e8cd14" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="iPhone 13 mini" data-uuid="3b48e195-b164-3652-8c00-2ae92ee476f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>For photos and videos, the iPhone 13 mini features a more capable dual-camera array than its predecessor. Apple claims the phone&#39;s primary 12-megapixel sensor can capture 47 percent more light for less noisy photos. Meanwhile, the phone&#39;s ultra-wide camera borrows the sensor-shift image optical stabilization technology the company first introduced in last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-cameras-battery-price-233156949.html">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a>. With its A15 Bionic chip, the iPhone 13 mini comes with a feature called Cinematic Mode that allows you blur the background of a video while the subject stays in focus.&nbsp;</p><p>Ahead of today’s event, there were conflicting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-iphone-in-display-fingerprint-sensor-223939578.html">reports</a> over whether Apple would outfit the entire iPhone 13 line with in-display fingerprint sensors. In the end, the iPhone 13 mini and its siblings don’t add any new methods of biometric authentication. As such, unless you’re <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html">wearing an Apple Watch</a>, you’ll still need to input a passcode to unlock the iPhone 13 mini while wearing a mask.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the iPhone 12 mini, the 13 mini includes Apple’s Ceramic Shield technology, which the company claims helps make the phone’s screen more resistant to damage from drops. It&#39;s also IP68 certified against water and dust. On the connectivity front, Apple has expanded the iPhone&#39;s 5G support to work with more bands. By the end of the year, the company says the phone will work on the networks of 200 carriers in 60 countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple will offer the iPhone 13 mini in six colors: pink, blue, midnight (black), starlight (gold) and (Product) Red. The base model starts at $699 and comes with 128GB of internal storage. That&#39;s an upgrade from last year when it came with 64GB of space. Pre-orders for the iPhone 13 mini open on September 17th, with general availability to follow on September 24th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s iPhone event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-mini-annoucement-175051051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f2db7c9f-eaf8-4e72-ae90-3998312c3914</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:50:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631645010</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T18:43:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ad15f840-1583-11ec-b93a-06b3866271cc" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ad15f840-1583-11ec-b93a-06b3866271cc" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Turi / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Fitness+ adds Group Workouts so you can exercise with friends via SharePlay]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s fitness subscription service will soon make it easier for you to take a virtual class with friends and family.

Similarly, the feature will allow Apple Fitness+ users to take exercise classes with contacts, regardless of their location. During the class, you&#39;ll see some of your friends&#39; fitness data on your screen as well as when they close their activity rings. And the feature will support up to 32 people at once, so you could have a yoga party with all of your extended family.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple&#39;s bringing a handful of smaller updates to Fitness+ this fall as well. Pilates workouts will come to the service, as well as guided meditation routines that will also be available in audio-only format.

Apple stated in August that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html">SharePlay viewing</a> would likely be delayed until later in the fall. Apple Fitness+ will also be available in 15 new countries this fall, including Austria, Italy, Germany, France, Portugal, Mexico and more, with workouts available in English with subtitles in six different languages.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s iPhone event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-adds-group-workouts-so-you-can-exercise-with-friends-via-share-play-174529068.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">431e7b88-9690-4bd9-9faa-0dfda8e148c1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:45:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631643725</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T18:22:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/86628ca0-1582-11ec-bbf7-18017082990a" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/86628ca0-1582-11ec-bbf7-18017082990a" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Fitness+ Group Workout]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Fitness+ Group Workout]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's iPhone 13 has a smaller notch and bigger battery]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple isn&#39;t worried about 13 being an unlucky number. The company just unveiled its latest generation of smartphones, the iPhone 13, and is giving us the rundown on all the changes to this year&#39;s models right now. Unsurprisingly, it looks nearly identical to last year&#39;s iPhone 12, but our first glimpse of it showed a 20-percent smaller notch on the front for Face ID as well as a redesigned back camera module — but by and large, it&#39;s visually nearly identical to the iPhone 12.</p><p>More crucially, the iPhone 13 also has a bigger battery, something that should be welcome for both phones, particularly the iPhone 13 mini. Yep, Apple is keeping the smaller phone around this year. Both phones also have 28 percent brighter screens, but Apple says most iPhone 13 mini users will get an extra 1.5 hours of usage, while the standard iPhone 13 will last 2.5 hours longer than the iPhone 12. Given that battery life was probably one of the biggest downsides of last year&#39;s iPhones, this should give users a little relief. The screen sizes are identical to last year: 6.1 inches for the iPhone 13, and 5.4 inches on the iPhone 13 mini.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="dc438231-0871-4fa1-9e67-968c1b4c88f3"/><p>As usual, the new iPhone features Apple&#39;s latest A-series chip, and this year it&#39;s the A15 Bionic processor. It&#39;s a 5nm chip with nearly 15 billion transistors that Apple says is 50 percent faster than its competition. It has two new high-performance cores, four new efficiency cores, a faster four-core graphics processor (again, compared to undefined competition), and a faster neural engine, its dedicated neural networking processor.</p><p>As for the cameras, Apple has a new wide camera sensor and lens; Apple says its the largest camera sensor it has ever put into a dual-camera system on its phones, and it has bigger pixels than the prior phone. The iPhone 13 is also getting the sensor-shift optical image stabilization system that first came to the iPhone 12 Pro Max last year — having this system available on a much more inexpensive phone will be a nice boost. There&#39;s also a new ultra-wide camera sensor, as well.</p><p>Apple has made a video a big focus in recent years, and that&#39;s the case with the iPhone 13 as well. The company is showing off a new mode called &quot;cinematic mode,&quot; but they haven&#39;t said exactly what that&#39;s all about yet. We did get to see it in action in a clip they showed, and it seems that it lets the camera move focus seamlessly between the foreground and background. As Apple says, focus transitions will move focus automatically and follow character&#39;s attention so that it knows where to direct your attention. Naturally, you can still tap to change focus at any time.</p><p>5G support for the iPhone 13 has been expanded, as well — the antenna system works on more carriers than ever. By the end of the year, Apple says 5G will work on 200 carriers in 60 countries.</p><p>As for pricing, Apple kept things the same this year: the iPhone 13 mini starts at $699, while the iPhone 13 starts at $799. Both phones come with 128GB of storage (doubled from a year ago), which is another major upgrade over last year&#39;s model. This year&#39;s colors are black, silver, red, blue and a new pink finish. Preorders open on Friday, and the phones will be available on September 24th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s iPhone event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-174459983.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dbd9476f-fcce-4fd6-beca-95f35c9e828b</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:44:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631645487</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T18:51:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/04bd59e0-1583-11ec-b77f-45e69e8515c8" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/04bd59e0-1583-11ec-b77f-45e69e8515c8" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 delivers larger screens and more durability]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s basic Watch design has remained largely unchanged since its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-30-apple-watch-review.html">2015 debut</a>, but that&#39;s about to change. The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apple-reveals-apple-watch-series-7-featuring-the-largest-most-advanced-display/">introduced</a> Apple Watch Series 7 with a new (if <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-larger-screen-sizes-213316597.html">long-rumored</a>), more seamless design with larger 41mm and 45mm cases that include larger, brighter and more durable screens to match. There&#39;s also a wider variety of aluminum colors. Green, anyone? The update takes advantage of the bigger displays, with more information and new watch faces like Contour, Modular Duo and World Timer.</p><p>As for durability? Series 7 is the first Apple Watch with a dust resistance rating (IP6X), making it better-suited to mountain climbing or the beach. The screen itself is more crack-resistant thanks to a thicker new geometry, and you&#39;ll still get swim-friendly WR50 (that is, 50-meter) water resistance. You won&#39;t confuse this with a rugged watch, but you might not panic quite so much after a fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a49aeed0-158a-11ec-b53f-96cfcec3a3a7" alt="Apple Watch Series 7 in steel" data-uuid="502b8219-ca2d-3f05-bc98-a8e6d9c737cf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The updates aren&#39;t quite so aggressive under the hood. You can anticipate 33 percent faster charging and fall detection during workouts. Most of the updates come through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8</a>, which now includes detection of cycling workouts, better tracking for e-bikes and help if you fall off. You&#39;ll also get a full swipe-based keyboard, support for more workouts (Pilates and Tai Chi) and respiratory rate tracking while you sleep.</p><p>Apple Watch Series 7 will arrive sometime this fall starting at $399. The Apple Watch SE and Watch Series 3 will hang around at respective prices of $299 and $199, and you can expect refreshed Nike and Hermès variants for the Series 7. This isn&#39;t as conspicuous a redesign as some had suggested, but it&#39;s a more tangible improvement than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Series 6</a> and might still be worthwhile if you&#39;re craving more visual real estate on your wrist.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="d55ad65e-db82-4533-8984-ff64a7f76a1b"/><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s iPhone event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-release-date-price-172920553.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa0448e6-ca53-4783-b72c-77bbbea0b3b1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 17:29:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631646070</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T19:01:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11e24a10-1581-11ec-bf77-c48fd8396aa3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11e24a10-1581-11ec-bf77-c48fd8396aa3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's sixth-gen iPad mini gets USB-C and an all-screen design]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After two and a half years without a refresh, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-iphone-13-event-apple-160001317.html">Apple</a> is at long last revamping the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ipad%20mini">iPad mini</a>. The 8.3-inch device has slimmer bezels and rounded corners, and it leaves no space for a physical Home button. As with last year&#39;s iPad Air, you&#39;ll now find the Touch ID sensor in the power button.&nbsp;</p><p>The Lightning port is gone too, with a USB-C port taking its place.

You can attach the peripheral magnetically to the side of the iPad Mini.&nbsp;</p><p>The screen is a liquid retina display with 500 nits of brightness, a P3 wide color gamut, anti-reflective screen coating, True Tone and full lamination. The iPad Mini now has stereo speakers, so watching video on it could be much better this time around.</p><p>The tablet is powered by a new A15 Bionic chip. Apple says the chip can deliver up to 80-percent faster performance than the previous iPad mini, with the six-core CPU offering a 40-percent performance boost and the five-core GPU delivering up to 80 percent better graphics performance.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="252ae7c9-fa7d-4b64-9be0-4ff2c56c1d39"/><p>The company says the tablet&#39;s machine learning (ML) capabilities have improved too, with a 16-core neural engine and ML accelerators capable of running tasks twice as quickly as the fifth-gen tablet. Among the ML capabilities are on-device recognition of text in photos, and the ability to translate that into seven different languages.</p><p>The camera system is getting an upgrade as well, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">iPad Pro&#39;s Center Stage experience</a> coming to iPad mini, so you&#39;ll stay in frame as you move around while on a video call. The front-facing camera now has a 12MP sensor, as does the rear camera, which also has a larger aperture than in the past and a True Tone flash.</p><p>On the connectivity front, there&#39;s WiFi 6 support and models with 5G. Apple&#39;s continuing to support Gigabit LTE and eSIM too.</p><p>Apple has created a new $59 Smart Folio cover for iPad mini with colors (black, white, dark cherry, English lavender and electric orange) to match the tablet&#39;s new finishes.&nbsp;</p><p>The new iPad mini is available in purple, pink, starlight and space grey.

Apple promises that it has a 20 percent faster performance than the previous iPad, from the CPU, GPU and the Neural Engine. The company also claims that the new iPad is three times faster than the top-selling Chromebook and six times faster than the top-selling Android tablet.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="0b244e06-370d-48d6-b1a7-a59e8248309a"/><p>The new iPad also features a new front-facing 12-megapixel Ultra Wide camera that is especially useful for video calls. It has a 122-degree field-of-view and comes with Center Stage, a tech that we&#39;ve already seen in Apple&#39;s iPad Pro. Similar to the tech on Facebook&#39;s Portal devices, Center Stage automatically detects people and dynamically adjusts the frame as you move around, or as more people join the call. The tech works in both portrait and landscape mode.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Center Stage feature works not just on Facetime but in other video apps too, like Zoom, Bluejeans and WebEx. Plus, the tech isn&#39;t just for video calls. Users can also utilize the tech to record, stream and publish videos to apps like DoubleTake, Explain Everything and TikTok.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, the new iPad has a 10.2-inch Retina display with True Tone, which adjusts the screen content to the color temperature of your surroundings. It will support existing accessories like Apple&#39;s Smart Keyboard and the first-generation Apple Pencil.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest iPad will ship with iPadOS 15, which has more intuitive multitasking thanks to Split View and Slide Over features, new widget layouts for the home screen, and systemwide Notes. Other iPad OS 15 features include the Translate app, Live Text that recognizes text in a photo, and Focus which lets users filter out notifications. iPadOS 15 will be available starting September 20th.

Of course, these are for <em>slightly</em> more advanced users given the investment. The only problem is you have to make a decision. The bundles include the three Mother synthesizers, but you have to decide between the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-01-moog-mother-32-synthesizer.html">Mother-32</a> and DFAM or DFAM and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/moog-subharmonicon-semi-modular-synth-review-160011051.html">Subharmonicon</a>. Those are the two combinations available starting $1,399. However, Moog is going a step further with its latest offer: all three Mother synths with the extra gear <a href="https://www.moogmusic.com/products/moog-sound-studio-mother-32-dfam-subharmonicon">for $1,999</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the previous bundles, this three-synth option comes with everything you need to get started. That includes a dust cover, audio mixer/power distribution hub, rack kit, cables, cable organizer, learning materials and even those adorable cardboard cutouts. As a refresher, the Mother-32 is a production synthesizer with a step sequencer and 64 slots of memory. It offers a classic Moog voice for raw analog tone combined with the company&#39;s deep bass. The DFAM is a drum synth for all of your rhythm and percussion needs while the Subharmonicon is designed for experimentation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d92ab490-1559-11ec-9976-c7453b69a1d5" alt="Moog Sonic Studio" data-uuid="91196545-8ef0-3ba9-bd31-6660f961062b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>For this three-synth bundle, Moog created a card game to foster collaboration and experimentation. Inspired by the gaming community in the company&#39;s home city of Asheville, North Carolina, <em>Circuitous Connections</em> allows you to explore analog synthesis at your own pace. The game helps you discover new sounds and learn patching techniques along the way. The company says this &quot;happy accident generator&quot; will allow you to play repeatedly without patching the same thing twice. Moog also explains that you can have just as much fun playing solo as you can with others.&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did with the initial Sound Studio packages, Moog is releasing another EP alongside this new offering. <em>Explorations in Analog Synthesis, Volume II</em> includes work from Boy Harsher, Hannah Peel, Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, Galcher Lustwerk, Ya Tseen, Tygapaw and Paula Temple.

At some point, you’d think the company would run out of interesting synths to emulate, but not just yet. The newest addition to the Arturia family is the SQ80 V, a recreation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensoniq_SQ-80">Ensoniq SQ-80</a>.</p><p>The SQ-80 was a bit of a strange beast. It was released in 1987 and combined 8-bit digital wavetables with analog filters. It’s quirky, crunchy and seriously fun. It combines crunch lo-fi digital samples with analog warmth for something pretty unique. Also, at a time when many synth makers were stripping down their interfaces while stuffing in every feature they could imagine (looking at you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-dx7-ai-patches-155010833.html">DX7</a>), the SQ-80 was surprisingly easy to program. It was also one of the earliest keyboards with polyphonic aftertouch, which is captured here thanks to MPE support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="454ab996902b48f785c8a9a41d913af3"><iframe width="100%" height="300" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1124439196%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-hucGs5dqGQ9&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/arturia-sq80-v-sound-demos/s-hucGs5dqGQ9" title="Arturia SQ80 V sound demos" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Arturia SQ80 V sound demos</a></div></div><p>Arturia normally takes great pains to recreate the physical appearance and controls of a synth they’re emulating, but the company simplified things a bit for the SQ80 V. You can change the oscillator waves and tweak the filter, but many of the controls, like the three LFOs and four envelopes are all on a separate synthesis tab that’s a little more mouse friendly.</p><p>Arturia also went all out with the sound sources. It includes the original 75 waveforms, as well as the “hidden” waves from the SQ-80 and it’s predecessor the ESQ-1, plus a selection of transient waveforms. The company greatly expanded on the sound design possibilities of the SQ80 V without really straying from the heart and character of the original.</p><p>This is pretty par for the course, though. Arturia has been at this long enough, meticulously emulating classic synths while adding some modern conveniences, that it’ be more surprising if it missed the mark at this point.</p><p>The one thing this means though, is that the company is filling increasingly small niches in its arsenal of instruments. The SQ80 V is a digital synthesizer, with a lo-fi character built around sampled waveforms and an analog filter. If that sounds familiar, it’s because the same broad description also applies to the E-MU Emulator II which Arturia recreated for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-8-analog-lab-v-hands-on-softsynth-vst-173441647.html">V Collection 8</a> in December.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d099e7f2-155a-11ec-9efd-6ba4f0e16c6e" alt="Arturia SQ80 V" data-uuid="80e8502f-18fe-3835-9cea-6fa45f04bc0f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>While both are definitely crunchy and digital they have identities all their own. The Emulator II is more of a straightforward sampler, and the SQ-80 is closer to a traditional synthesizer. While I quite enjoyed the lo-fi bit-crushed keys of the Emulator, I dig the SQ80 V more. It’s more approachable to someone coming from the world of synthesizers. Plus, it’s a little warmer and more timeless sounding. Not that you can’t get cheesy 80s sounds out of the SQ80 V, it’s just easier to coax modern sound out of than the Emulator which can be a touch too cold and brittle for my tastes.</p><p>While there are some analog style sounds in the SQ80 V, its bread and butter is crushed digital sounds. Harsh industrial hits, dusty keys and ambient pads. There are two sound packs being released alongside it that lean into those strengths: Dust Factory and Raw Machinery.</p><p>But even if you skip the sound packs, you should be able to easily find sounds that you like either in the included presets or by designing your own. And building your own patches is pretty simple. The three digital oscillators have dropdown menus for selecting waveforms, the envelopes and LFOs all have their own tabs, and the filter can be shaped with the mouse. The whole interface is clean, charmingly retro and easy to navigate. It’s especially impressive considering how much power there is to manipulate things. Most parameters can be modulated by a number of different sources — and many can be modulated by two sources at the same time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d099e7f1-155a-11ec-9f76-60e9046c80b9" alt="Arturia SQ80 V" data-uuid="c5a8b1a7-b4c2-36c6-90d9-af95ca23e327"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>My one minor complaint UI-wise is that the tiny dials next to the various modulation destinations could be a little clearer. It might not be immediately obvious to everyone that, if you want LFO two to change the filter cutoff you have to hover over the darkened circle underneath it then click on the even tinier plus sign that pops up to select a modulation source. Then you click and drag on the circle to set the modulation amount.</p><p>Minor quibble with that aside, Arturia does deserve credit for putting a lot of effort into creating thorough and clear tutorials for all its instruments over the last couple of years and SQ80 V is no different.</p><p>Arturia’s V Collection is stuffed with great instruments and great sounds, but the SQ80 V is quickly becoming one of my favorites (though, it is technically not part of the V Collection — yet). It&#39;s available now as a standalone instrument for an introductory price of $99 until October 5 at which point it will go up to $199. It can also be bundled with V Collection 8 at a discount, though the final price will depend on your status as an Arturia customer.</p><div id="9d8a8f7c3b0e4cba90ae2d1c40f8ffb8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ijB2WHCh2zo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-sq-80-v-ensoniq-virtual-synth-hands-on-superbooth-160036483.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f435b6c-4954-4457-8e9c-d03b1a50d024</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 16:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631631040</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T14:50:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d099c0e1-155a-11ec-b7f7-88d4a2d2fb55" width="1279" height="473" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d099e7f0-155a-11ec-beb7-e336ec0c481c" width="1280" height="514" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia SQ80 V]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia SQ80 V]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ubisoft brings back Driver as a live-action TV show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you miss <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-06-driver-san-francisco-review.html">Driver games</a>, you&#39;ll soon get to revisit the classic open-world franchise — but not in a playable form. <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-09-14-ubisofts-revives-driver-ip-as-a-live-action-series">reports</a> Ubisoft is <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/7smQNfXZ0UFKbZ7w6o8sDO/liveaction-driver-series-coming-to-binge">producing</a> a live-action Driver TV show that will premiere solely on Binge, a free gaming-oriented streaming service due to launch in 2022. The duo didn&#39;t detail the plot or cast, but it won&#39;t be surprising if the series revolves around racer-turned-undercover-agent John Tanner.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear when the show will arrive. It&#39;s not guaranteed to launch alongside Binge itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For many, the larger question may be whether or not there&#39;s a large audience for the show. Like with the rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splinter-cell-netlfix-animated-series-201748507.html"><em>Splinter Cell</em> series</a>, Ubisoft hasn&#39;t touched the originating game brand in a while. The last Driver game was a 2014 free-to-play mobile title, <em>Driver:</em><em>Speedboat Paradise</em>, and the last truly big release was 2011&#39;s <em>Driver: San Francisco</em>. This also isn&#39;t quite a timeless classic. Apart from the very first <em>Driver</em> and <em>San Francisco</em>, most games in the series have received middling reviews and the sales to match.</p><p>The series does have a premise virtually tailor-made for TV, though, with its <em>Bullitt</em>-inspired premise and real-world setting. And look at it this way: we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the show presaged the development of a new Driver game, even if it was just a show tie-in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-driver-live-action-tv-show-155250265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1c31da2-0bd3-421c-b925-e92cf692b04c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:52:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631634194</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T15:43:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f68a3760-156b-11ec-b6eb-d3ab547c322f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f68a3760-156b-11ec-b6eb-d3ab547c322f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft/Binge]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ubisoft 'Driver' TV series for Binge]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ubisoft 'Driver' TV series for Binge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Apple's iPhone 13 event right here at 1PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-apple-iphone-13-rumors-leaks-california-streaming-event-160034910.html">iPhone 13 event</a> is finally here, and you&#39;ll have multiple ways to watch — including after the big show.

You could also see camera upgrades, the usual speed improvements, a 1TB storage option and even emergency satellite calls. Not that the iPhone will necessarily be the only star. Many also expect an Apple Watch Series 7 with a brand new case design, and you might see third-generation AirPods as well as new iPads.

The new feature, called Tonal Live, will offer real-time community classes calibrated for each user. Tonal says coaches will be able to correct participants&#39; form and give shoutouts to people whose cameras are on. While the allure of live workouts is being able to get feedback from a trainer in real time, members can access any live session they miss — they will be added to the gym&#39;s on-demand library after 24 hours.</p><p>As part of the new feature&#39;s arrival, Tonal has redesigned its user interface and mobile app to make it easy to discover live sessions and to preview what kind of workout each one entails. The company has also designed a &quot;social zone,&quot; where members can interact directly with each other and see their activities and milestones. In addition, Tonal will introduce four new coaches members can work out with.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tonal CEO Aly Orady said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Tonal has always been unique in the way that we’ve approached our workout content with adaptive weights, individualized pacing, and form feedback that are customized to our members in real-time. As our community has grown over the past few years, we’ve been encouraged by the organic social engagement, the craving for more interaction with our coaches, and the excitement that comes from reaching new milestones; Tonal Live will allow us to connect these elements through a studio experience while retaining the foundation of what differentiates our workouts: personalization, guidance, and feedback.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While Tonal has been around since 2018, it experienced tremendous growth in 2020 due to the increase in demand for home fitness solutions in the midst of the pandemic. Its sales grew more than eight times, and it raised $250 million in funding, giving the business a $1.6 billion valuation. Back then, the company said it would invest that money into expanding its content and offerings, and this new feature is one of those investments.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Tonal Live" href="https://fave.co/3z5b1EV">Tonal Live</a> will be available starting on October 20th, 2021.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tonal-live-workouts-smart-home-gym-150033495.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bfa86132-b7c9-4556-b629-afa207e57b60</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 15:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631632816</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T15:20:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3f350e0-154d-11ec-ac3f-32809e785cc6" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3f350e0-154d-11ec-ac3f-32809e785cc6" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tonal]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tonal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tonal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kroger and Instacart promise grocery deliveries in as little as 30 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Kroger is betting big on internet grocery delivery services, and it&#39;s tapping Instacart for help.

I first played this rhythm title at a Toys ‘R’ Us and fell in love with those stupid bongos.

I quickly unlocked every song, and became an absolute master at “Oye Como Va.” It was followed by a sequel and the bongos were even the default control scheme for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Donkey Kong Jungle Beat" href="https://amzn.to/3CbD0V5"><em>Donkey Kong Jungle Beat</em></a>, but nothing matched the sheer joy of playing that first installment and the sore palms that ensued. — <em>KN</em></p><h2>Eternal Darkness: Sanity&#39;s Requiem</h2><div id="1a9b18f5cda0490ba42dbd5646f930a7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HwjKeFJkhFM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Call it the anti-Resident Evil. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Eternal Darkness" href="https://amzn.to/3lkb5M6"><em>Eternal Darkness</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>puts you in the shoes of Alexandra Roivas, a young woman trying to solve the mystery of her grandfather&#39;s horrific death. Its century-spanning story covered a dozen characters, all connected to an ancient Lovecraftian god. While there&#39;s combat, it was more about psychological trauma than the survival horror of <em>Resident Evil. </em>Most notably, it had a sanity meter that would change the gameplay and environment and even throw simulated system errors to freak out players. Take that, <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p><p>Like many GameCube titles, <em>Eternal Darkness </em>was clearly an attempt to attract an older audience. It was the first M-rated game published by Nintendo, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-files-new-eternal-darkness-trademark/1100-6412171/">company kept the trademark alive</a> for a decade. But it was never re-released outside of the GameCube, and hope for a direct sequel was squashed when developer Silicon Knights filed for bankruptcy in 2014. There was an attempt at a spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-05-03-eternal-darkness-successor-shadow-of-the-eternals-announced-c.html"><em>Shadow of the Eternals</em></a>, that fell apart after failing to raise enough money via crowdfunding.

Nearly two decades later its presentation looks stiff and dated, and the game is missing the relationship mechanics beloved by newcomers. But in <em>Path of Radiance </em>you’ll still find many of the elements that came to define later Fire Emblem games.</p><p>They exist in a sort of prototypical form since this was the first game in the series to make the jump to 3D. We take a lot of it for granted now, but back then series developer Intelligent Systems had to figure out the mechanics for the first time. And it did, making for a game that’s still fun to play to this day. It has one of the best stories in the series, with an English script that captures a lot of the nuances of the Japanese original.</p><p>It’s that story that made me fall in love with <em>Path of Radiance</em> when I first played it more than 15 years ago. Even when the game was at its most punishing, I wanted to see what would happen to Ike and his band of mercenaries. <em>Path of Radiance </em>was my first Fire Emblem game, but it’s the one I keep coming back to because of just how much I enjoyed my first playthrough as a teen. — <em>Igor Bonifacic, Contributing Editor</em></p><h2>F-Zero GX</h2><div id="2940e2c1c1b74dccbda520e183093cf6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lEuHOFgjrAo?rel=0&amp;start=364" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The original <em>F-Zero</em> for the Super NES is one of those games I wore out as a teenager. While the futuristic space racer only had 15 courses, they were beautiful and challenging, and even when I did well, I always felt like I could do a <em>little</em> better. A decade later, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:F-Zero GX" href="https://amzn.to/3htXznS"><em>F-Zero GX</em></a> hit the GameCube and showed just how far racing had come.</p><p>The basic concept is the same: high-speed futuristic hovercraft battling it out in wild, creative courses where one mistake can lead to disaster. The GameCube’s horsepower meant the courses were longer, more complicated and visually stunning. The sense of speed was probably the biggest change, though: even now, 20 years later, this game feels incredibly fast. That speed makes it positively unforgiving, and I never progressed that far through the game’s many challenges. Driver AI was also significantly improved. In the first game, you mostly only had to worry about the three main rivals. But in <em>GX</em>, it’s easy to end up in 15th or 20th place in the blink of an eye if you’re not careful.</p><p>Despite that, I still remember the game fondly, in large part because it’s the last real entry in the F-Zero franchise. I didn’t play the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:F-Zero X" href="https://amzn.to/3tQxQeB">Nintendo 64 entry</a> in the series, so the jump from the SNES to the GameCube was pretty mind-blowing at the time. It’s a shame that Nintendo has let the series languish since then, because I’d love an updated version of <em>GX</em> for the Switch. — <em>Nate Ingraham, Deputy Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Mario Kart: Double Dash</h2><div id="df45159857e14ca3bcf508fb57c4bafa"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T40XgwgcJww?rel=0&amp;start=2170" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I have fond memories of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:GameStop;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Mario Kart: Double Dash" href="https://fave.co/2VGwFSc"><em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em></a> for a not-unique reason. In the early 2000s, my friends and I had frequent co-op video game nights, and <em>Double Dash</em> was a mainstay in our lineup. Mario Kart games have always been amazing in local multiplayer, and <em>Double Dash</em> was no exception. After <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, it was disappointing that all four players couldn’t compete directly against each other, but we quickly got used to the game’s unusual mechanic that let one player drive and another throw weapons. Having two teams of two players was an interesting wrinkle to the gameplay, and it makes <em>Double Dash</em> one of the more unusual games in the series.</p><p>As with most GameCube games, it looks wonderful. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Mario Kart 64" href="https://amzn.to/3k64VQ5"><em>Mario Kart 64</em></a>, like a lot of N64 games, hasn’t aged as well visually, but <em>Double Dash</em> is still gorgeous, and Nintendo took a major step forward in terms of creativity and variety in the game’s levels. There are more hidden routes and ways to approach each level than ever before, and the scope of boards like Wario Colosseum and the game’s take on the ubiquitous Rainbow Road were unmatched at the time. It’s no coincidence that almost every course in this game has appeared in subsequent versions of Mario Kart — so even if you never played <em>Double Dash</em>, you’ve likely come across some of its iconic tracks. — <em>NI</em></p><h2>Metroid Prime</h2><div id="1d1bc64f70e64455847c6463410dcccd"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o_erwihybUQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the 80s and 90s, the Metroid franchise was defined by three classic titles: the original <em>Metroid</em> for the NES, <em>Metroid II: Return of Samus </em>on the Game Boy, and <em>Super Metroid </em>on the Super NES. They cemented Metroid gameplay as a side-scrolling action / exploration game, with a non-linear set of levels. Players would come across areas that you couldn’t fully explore before beating bosses and finding items in other parts of the game.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Prime" href="https://amzn.to/2YUieez"><em>Metroid Prime</em></a>, however, completely turned the series around, putting it in 3D for the first time. While the style resembled a first-person shooter, the gameplay still put exploration at the forefront, rather than fast-paced gun fights. That said, the game is plenty challenging, even punishing at times in its difficulty: its massive bosses and twisting tunnels full of enemies were unforgiving.</p><p>But for me, the most memorable part of <em>Metroid Prime</em> is the incredible atmosphere of Tallon IV, and the wonder of finding new sections of the deserted planet to explore. <em>Prime</em> also did a great job at expanding the story and lore of the Metroid series, with loads of scannable items that explain what happened to the ruined world. The sequels to <em>Metroid Prime</em> are great, but this first game is arguably the best in the series and a huge part of why we’re all so excited about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-25-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-retro-studios.html">someday</a> getting our hands on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Prime 4" href="https://amzn.to/2YObFtP"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a><em>. </em>— <em>NI</em></p><h2>Odama</h2><div id="a442719990084ec696a144bcfb645edb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1AVbP2rV_0?rel=0&amp;start=55" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It’s such a strange concept that it sounds like some developer’s fever dream — a combination pinball strategy game with voice control. But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Odama" href="https://amzn.to/3CakkoM"><em>Odama</em></a> was quite real, and it was glorious. Like any tactical wargame, you controlled an army of men (though via voice commands) who needed to overtake the enemy gate at the top side of the display. Complicating things was a giant ball that destroyed all in its path, but fortunately, you could exert some control over it with a pair of flippers at the bottom of the screen. There was a lot going on and it was utterly bonkers, but if you managed to beat <em>Odama</em> you were rewarded with the <a href="https://youtu.be/JeKylEFR6lI">best ending theme to a video game ever</a>. — <em>KN</em></p><h2>Pokémon Colosseum</h2><div id="32167df31f8b44fea9438f8fc1cc346a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jdRt1p57df4?rel=0&amp;start=3084" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Though the Pokémon series is, at its heart, a role-playing game series from Japan, it’s not very typical of the JRPG genre we’ve become accustomed to through franchises like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest. But way back in 2003 second-party developer Genus Sonority tried its hand as a more “traditional” story-based RPG, placing the player in the shoes of a reformed criminal trying to rescue Pokémon from his former organization. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pok&#xe9;mon Colosseum" href="https://amzn.to/3C8zKtU"><em>Pokémon Colosseum</em></a> took place in the cyberpunk-flavored Orre region, as opposed to the more pastoral settings of the handheld RPGs. The “snagging” mechanic for collecting Pokémon was interesting, and the storyline had more of an edge to it. It was followed by a sequel in 2005, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pok&#xe9;mon XD" href="https://amzn.to/3EflYr5"><em>Pokémon XD</em></a>, but I’d love to see this spinoff series continued on the Switch. — <em>KN</em></p><h2>Resident Evil 4</h2><div id="3922bb04be464ee6be9afb886b0a0551"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6sKj1aFF7c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It&#39;s easy to forget that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Resident Evil 4" href="https://amzn.to/3hutDId"><em>Resident Evil 4</em></a> was initially a GameCube exclusive. It&#39;s been re-released on practically every platform, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-oculus-quest-2-223807329.html">Oculus Quest 2</a> later this year. But it all started on Nintendo&#39;s purple box, a platform not known for having many action titles. The game&#39;s staying power makes sense though. It&#39;s the first Resident Evil game rendered completely in 3D, and it featured a slick over-the-shoulder camera that made shooting infected baddies feel genuinely kinetic.</p><p><em>Resident Evil 4</em>&#39;s gameplay would go on to influence not just the entire series, but most action games moving forward. It was also a great example of the GameCube&#39;s unheralded horsepower, which could deliver smoother and crisper graphics than the PlayStation 2. Even today, the original GameCube <em>RE4 </em>still looks fantastic, with high-quality character models and environments teeming with detail. In comparison, the PS2 version <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MBy3MX2nI">look like a muddy mess</a>. — <em>DH</em></p><h2>Skies of Arcadia Legends</h2><div id="3664f5f4fb654f3daf1b0f6efaab561d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySrpGj3vuNc?rel=0&amp;start=389" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It may not be fair to call <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Skies of Arcadia Legends" href="https://amzn.to/3EfmFR5"><em>Skies of Arcadia Legends</em></a> a GameCube game, since it&#39;s just a port of a classic Dreamcast title. But I&#39;m giving it a shout because it&#39;s still one of the best RPGs I&#39;ve ever played, and perhaps reminiscing about it will finally spur on a digital re-release. The GameCube port fixes some of the frame rate and stability issues from the Dreamcast, and adds new characters to boot, making it the definitive version of the game.</p><p>Set in a world of floating continents, <em>Skies of Arcadia Legends </em>focuses on sky pirates who embark on a world-saving journey, naturally. You can explore a 3D world map with your airship, which gets into large-scale turn-based battles with other vessels and giant enemies. Much like <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, you can tell that <em>Skies of Arcadia </em>comes from a dream team of developers. In this case, the staff previously worked on Phantasy Star, Panzer Dragoon and Sakura Wars.</p><p>While Sega originally planned to bring <em>Skies of Arcadia</em> to the PlayStation 2, it ended up focusing on the GameCube port instead. Perhaps Nintendo has a stake in that port and we just don&#39;t know. Still, it&#39;d be nice to play such a well-crafted game once again.

The PS5 patch is the big one since, 10 months after Sony released the console, the company is finally unlocking the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/play-station-5-will-get-internal-storage-upgrades-this-summer-095311001.html">internal storage expansion slot</a> for everyone.</p><p>Although you can store games on an external hard drive, you can&#39;t run <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ps5">PS5</a> titles from USB storage. Those drives are just too slow for PS5 games.

You&#39;ll be able to use the DualSense controller&#39;s microphone to measure the acoustics and help decide the best setting for your space. There will be equalizer settings for the Pulse 3D Wireless Headset too.</p><p>Some key user interface changes are on the way as part of tomorrow&#39;s update too. It should be easier to tell whether a game you have installed is the PS4 or PS5 version. Each will be listed separately in the Installed tab on the Home screen and in the Game Library.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll have additional customization options for the Control Center, including more choice over which controls to include in the bar at the bottom of your screen. You can move those around, so you can place the power menu on the left, if you like.

PlayStation Now members can select a resolution of 720p or 1080p depending on the game, and there&#39;s a tool to test your connection and hopefully help you resolve any issues.</p><p>The console will also be able to automatically record clips of your &quot;personal best&quot; moments, such as hitting a better time or score when you compete in challenges. You can access those clips from the Media Gallery or the challenge card in the Control Center.

You&#39;ll be able to see your PS5 trophies (as well as others&#39; PS5 accolades) on PS4. On both consoles, you&#39;ll be able to disband a Party without removing people individually if you&#39;re the Party owner.</p><p>On top of that, there are updates coming to the PlayStation mobile apps. Starting tomorrow, you&#39;ll at last be able to stream PS4 and PS5 games to your iOS or Android device over mobile networks, a feature that definitely would have come in handy for visits to the park during the summer. You can adjust video quality options to help manage your data.</p><p>Meanwhile, as of September 23rd, you&#39;ll be able to watch your friends&#39; PS5 Share Screen broadcasts through the PS App. It may take up to a week for the feature to become available through the Android version of the app, as Sony is rolling it out gradually on that platform.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab6f9dd5-2df3-45e2-adc7-04bbdd806320</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 13:50:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631627901</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T13:58:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d95b19c0-1561-11ec-ac7b-074ffaa5b277" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d95b19c0-1561-11ec-ac7b-074ffaa5b277" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Meyers/Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 storage expansion slot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 storage expansion slot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Movies Anywhere is now available on Xbox]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-samsung-smart-tvs-202921681.html"><ins>expanding to Samsung TVs</ins></a> earlier in the year, <a href="https://moviesanywhere.com/welcome"><ins>Movies Anywhere</ins></a>, the service that allows you to keep your digital film collection in one place, is now available on Xbox consoles.
