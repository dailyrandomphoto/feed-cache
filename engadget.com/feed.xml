According to the watchdog, the two companies signed an agreement in 2018 that would prohibit both official and unofficial resellers of Apple and Apple-owned Beats products on Amazon&#39;s Italian website. That agreement allegedly contained contractual clauses that only allowed Amazon itself and select sellers &quot;chosen individually and in a discriminatory way&quot; to sell those items.</p><p>AGCM said in its announcement that those clauses violate article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition, the watchdog said the agreement restricted cross-border sales, ultimately limiting buyers&#39; options and depriving them of the discounts typically offered by third-party sellers. The Italian authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-italy-antitrust-investigation-141046089.html">opened</a> the antitrust case against both companies in 2020 and even searched their offices in the country.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A total of 70 percent of consumer electronics purchases in the country are from Amazon, AGCM explained, and 40 percent were purchases from sellers that use the website as their main platform. That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential for Amazon to implement Italy&#39;s competition rules and ensure a level playing field for all sellers, as well as to ensure that buyers have access to more options.</p><p>AGCM imposed a fine of €68.7 million (US$77 million) on Amazon and a fine of €134.5 million (US$151.2 million) on Apple. It also ordered the companies to end the restrictions and allow the sale of Apple and Beats products on Amazon Italy in &quot;non-discriminatory manner.&quot; In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italys-antitrust-fines-amazon-apple-more-than-200-mln-euros-alleged-collusion-2021-11-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon called the imposed penalty &quot;disproportionate and unjustified.&quot; A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Apple denied any wrongdoing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, both companies are planning to appeal the watchdog&#39;s penalty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b51f0908-6fa4-453d-8742-b074ed6d5ba2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 12:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637670878</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T12:34:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Matthews - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of a pair of beats Mixr headphones alongside an Apple iPhone 5, as Apple will make the most expensive acquisition in its history, after confirming a deal to buy Dr Dre's Beats Electronics for 3 billion dollars (&pound;1.78 billion).

Now, Tile has been acquired family tracking company Life360 for $205 million in a move that could give it the resources to better contend with rivals. It will continue to operate with the same branding under current Tile CEO CJ Prober, Life360 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html">announced</a>.</p><p>Life360 said the acquisition will help it expand beyond family tracking to letting people &quot;locate the people, pets, and things they love.&quot; It noted that the addition of Life360&#39;s 33 million smartphone users will increase the reach of Tile&#39;s Finding Network by around 10x.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, Life360 will gain access to consumers in 27,000 retail stores where Tile trackers are sold. Tile&#39;s technology is also used in over a million third-party devices, ranging from wireless earphones to dog collars. The company will also acquire Tile&#39;s subscribers, boosting its total paid subscriber base by 45 percent to 1.6 million users.</p><p>The company emphasized that both Life360 and Tile are &quot;platform agnostic,&quot; working on both iOS and Android. The subtext is that Apple&#39;s AirTags only work on iOS, though Apple does have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/03/airtag-privacy-improvements-sound-android-app/">plans</a> to introduce Android compatibility by year&#39;s end. Last year, Tile <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-apple-european-commission-antitrust-143303005.html">filed an EU complaint</a> against Apple for alleged anticompetitive behavior, claiming the iOS 13.5 update made its app harder to use.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s certainly synergy between the companies, as Life360 has operated as a multi-platform &#39;Find My Friends&#39;-style service for years. Parents in the US, especially, have used the devices to keep track of their kids — so adding the ability to track objects and gadgets makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tile-to-be-acquired-by-family-location-sharing-service-life-360-103400952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ace2f260-fc89-439a-9b32-367261314528</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:34:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637663641</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T10:34:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dodge to phase out its Challenger and Charger muscle cars in shift towards EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dodge is phasing out its gas-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-dodge-charger-r-t-125300079.html">Charger</a> and Challenger muscle cars by 2024 in favor of electric muscle cars, <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-challenger-charger-dead-2024-ev-coming-soon/"><em>Motor Trend</em></a> has reported. The company plans to introduce its first concept EV by 2022, followed by a plug-in hybrid and a third type of unknown vehicle.

The first concept arriving in 2022 will be an electric muscle car, revealed in the next four or five months as a high-performance, drivable vehicle. The next model, a plug-in hybrid, will be a new car but not a Durango as some expected, according to Kuniskis. The third vehicle is unknown, but will be a &quot;very, very, very, significant car at the end of the year,&quot; he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Diehard muscle car fans might not take the news well, though they can&#39;t deny the superior performance of EVs. Dodge <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/22/the-muscle-car-goes-electric-dodge-sets-2024-end-date-for-gas-chargers-challengers/">previously advertised</a> the Challenger in &quot;Demon&quot; trim as the quickest 0-100MPH production car in the world, with the rather large caveat that it &quot;excludes non-mass production vehicles [supercars] and hybrids/electric.&quot;</p><p>Kuniskis acknowledged that the announcement could create friction. &quot;I&#39;m juggling knives because I&#39;ve gotta keep two different huge factions happy because at some point those two factions will converge,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is no one knows when they will converge. My job is to provide confidence, over the next 24 months, that we&#39;re gonna do this.&quot;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dodge-is-killing-its-challenger-and-charger-muscle-cars-in-favor-of-e-vs-085839976.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d6942e8-0c34-4bf4-a0d2-2d8948dfc2c8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:58:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637657921</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T08:58:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raymond Boyd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO - FEBRUARY 06:  2020 Dodge Charger SXT is on display at the 112th Annual Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois on February 6, 2020.

And after hinting his studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-kojima-may-venture-filmmaking.html"><ins>could venture into filmmaking</ins></a>, it&#39;s doing precisely that.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-22-kojima-productions-launches-new-film-tv-and-music-division"><em><ins>GamesIndustry.Biz</ins></em></a>, Kojima Productions has established a division dedicated to music, TV and film that will operate out of Los Angeles.

Kojima is known for his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">film-like approach</a> to making games, and if you <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1462586580023922689?s=20">follow him on Twitter</a>, you&#39;ll know he frequently tweets about his favorite albums and movies. The question now becomes how the studio plans to handle the expansion. Since reforming in 2015, Kojima Productions has released one game. You can push that number to two if you count the recent Director&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-trailer-release-date-220511148.html"> Cut</a> release of <em>Death Stranding</em> as a separate title. What would a film adaptation of <em>Death Stranding</em> look like? For that matter, what would an adaptation of any Kojima game look like?

The feature essentially allows users to both watch a broadcast and shop at the same time. The first live shopping stream will debut on November 28th at 7PM ET when Walmart <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1461640769240854529">hosts a Cyber Week-themed</a> livestream with Jason Derulo. The songwriter will spend about 30 minutes talking about a variety of products, including electronics and home decor.</p><p>“Livestreaming on Twitter gives businesses the power to engage with their most influential fans, and adding the ability to shop into this experience is a natural extension to attracting and engaging with receptive audiences,” Twitter said of the feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter has also started testing a “Shopping Manager” it says will help with the merchant onboarding experience. Additionally, the company is expanding the availability of the “Shop Module.” First announced in July, the tool allows brands and businesses to add a carousel to their profile that can highlight a selection of products. Over the coming weeks<strong>, </strong>the company says it will roll out the feature to more merchants in the US.</p><p>Compared to other social media platforms, Twitter has been slow to embrace and add e-commerce features. The fact the company is now adding a host of shopping features suggests it sees e-eommerce as a big part of its future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-live-shopping-broadcasts-173047423.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2415a6da-c30a-427a-992c-7cc55e5a5e1c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637602252</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T17:31:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/208c2090-4bb9-11ec-b9ff-b90ff20da7e7" width="920" height="575" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/208c2090-4bb9-11ec-b9ff-b90ff20da7e7" width="920" height="575" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter Live Shopping]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter Live Shopping]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo's Zelda-themed Game & Watch is a love letter to Link's 8-bit origins]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the 35th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. last year, Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-and-watch-mario-35th-anniversary-134844368.html">released a special edition Game &amp; Watch</a>. (If you don’t know, Game &amp; Watch were a line of handheld LCD devices from the ‘80s that could each play one very simple game.) Rather than featuring a single title, the Super Mario anniversary device had a full version of the original adventure as well as its Japan-only sequel, known in the West as <em>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</em>.</p><p>Nintendo’s pulling the same trick this year with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">35th-anniversary Legend of Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch </a>that just went on sale. And like last year’s model, it includes a color screen and full games, but the selection is more generous. It includes the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em>, both originally released on the NES. It also includes <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, which came out on the Game Boy in 1993, making this essentially a collection of Zelda’s early 8-bit adventures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9e195ca3-908a-4f1b-a864-e55c15b91250"/><p>I actually have never really played the first two Zelda games, though I do love <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review.html">played the Switch remaster</a> a few years ago, but I haven’t touched the original game since my childhood — so when we got a chance to check this tiny device out, I was pretty thrilled to give that game a go.</p><p>The Game &amp; Watch itself is elegantly designed, but also feels rather cheap. It’s a tiny, palm-sized device with an eye-catching gold front, while the rest of the device is clad in green plastic. The front has a 2.36-inch color LCD screen that is very small but also looks great — and when playing <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, the upgrade from the Game Boy’s screen, which had no backlight, is dramatic. The D-Pad and buttons are nothing to write home about, but they’re good enough.</p><p>On the right side of the device is an exceedingly modern USB-C port for charging its battery (which is pretty meager, so you’re going to need to do that a lot) and a power button; the speaker is on the left side. Finally, there’s a great Easter egg on the back: When the screen is on, the Triforce glows subtly through the green plastic. It’s a great little detail.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd402-4bad-11ec-b8be-2eb0c10a1f07" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="44813193-260a-3805-9dfe-42549c2b8267"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Game &amp; Watch has a few different modes: clock, timer and game. Pressing the “game” button lets you switch between the three Zelda titles, a Link-themed version of <em>Vermin</em> (from a 1980 Game &amp; Watch), and the timer. The clock and timer are fairly self-explanatory, but their use of Zelda action as backgrounds is expertly done.</p><p>On the clock, you’ll see the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, and the CPU-controlled Link essentially battles his way through the game over the course of the next 12 hours, defeating Ganon and rescuing Zelda at 11:59. If you’re so inclined, you can pick up the console and control the action from the clock screen at any time. Likewise, the timer features a handful of different scenes from <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em> that you can either watch or play yourself. The device’s packaging even converts into a little stand so you can use the Game &amp; Watch as a desk clock.</p><p>If you’re interested in this Game &amp; Watch, though, you’re not in it for playing the clock: you want to relive Link’s earliest adventures on the smallest portable device you can find. Sure, you can play the NES Zelda collection on the Switch (or many other old Nintendo devices), but the Game &amp; Watch’s miniature screen and old-school controls feel just right for these adventures. That’s doubly true with <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, since it was originally designed for portable systems.</p><p>The games themselves are exactly as you remember them, with no quality of life enhancements or graphics updates; <em>Link’s Awakening</em> is in black and white, rather than the later “DX” version released for the Game Boy color. I’m not complaining, though, as these original versions seem right for the Game &amp; Watch as a celebration of the series’ 8-bit origins.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd400-4bad-11ec-9e7f-06f68fb39497" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="96806375-923f-3239-8e5a-3913e18737fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>How you feel about these games will depend on your history with the series. Like I said, I’ve never played the original NES Zelda adventures; I got on board with <em>A Link to the Past</em> in 1992. As such, I don’t have a lot of nostalgic love for the original pair, and playing the first game was an exercise in frustration. There’s barely a map, Link is slow while enemies are fast, and aiming is imprecise at best. I definitely died more than my fair share of times, which was rather humbling for this self-described Zelda expert. But hey, I shouldn’t have expected anything different from a 1986 game, and I started to get the hang of it soon enough.</p><p><em>Link’s Awakening</em>, on the other hand, was like visiting an old friend. Muscle and brain memory combined to have me slashing my way through it in no time at all, and it controlled just like I remembered. The A and B buttons may have felt rather squishy, but the D-pad was close enough to the one on my old Game Boy that I felt right at home. I don’t know if I’ll finish the NES Zelda games, but I’ll definitely play through <em>Link’s Awakening</em>.</p><p>So who exactly is this $50 device for? The <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Game &amp; Watch was really only meant for people who loved that first Mario game, not necessarily people who love the Mario franchise in general. Likewise, The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch is best for someone who loved these original games growing up. It doesn’t even have to be all three, though — if one of them was a formative gaming experience, you’ll delight in getting a chance to play it on a cute little handheld. But someone raised on <em>Twilight Princess</em> or <em>Breath of the Wild</em> probably will find these a lot less essential.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-game-and-watch-review-173041656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4555aee0-ce9e-408a-b6a0-25d56a1ff37d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637607992</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T19:06:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The rectangular Zelda Game & Watch sitting on an old wooden desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zelda Game & Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analogue's Pocket handheld starts shipping on December 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html"><ins>multiple delays</ins></a>, the Analogue Pocket finally has an exact release date.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba 695" href="https://amzn.to/3FIZjnb">Roomba 694</a>, which came out earlier this year as a replacement for the Roomba 675, has dropped back down to an all-time low of $179. Normally $275, this model was already fairly inexpensive — especially for an iRobot device — but this Black Friday sale puts it in line with budget models from the likes of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker" href="https://amzn.to/3cAbhCS">Anker</a> and others.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FIZjnb" id="d0284edbad674d03a7e5d171d7afa32c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179</a><p>iRobot carried over most of the features from the Roomba 675 to the new 694, but the latest robo-vac has a sleeker design that features three physical buttons on its top. You can manually control the device using those buttons, or you can turn to the mobile app for that. When we tested the Roomba 694 for our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>, we found it to be good at cleaning both hard and carpeted floors, thanks in part to iRobot&#39;s three-stage cleaning system, and we liked its ability to focus on particularly dirty spots until they were completely clean. One of the on-device buttons even lets you activate a spot-cleaning mode if and when you want the device to clean only a targeted spot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companion app is one of the Roomba 694&#39;s selling points. It&#39;s pretty easy to navigate, even for those who have never used a robot vacuum before. With the iRobot app and the device connected to WiFi, you can set cleaning schedule and remotely turn the device on and off. You can even use Alexa or Google Assistant commands to tell the robo-vac to start a cleaning job — and when it&#39;s finished, it&#39;ll automatically return to its base for a recharge. It should last roughly 90 minutes on a single charge, which should be enough time for it to clean one floor of your home (depending on how big it is) or the entirety of a small apartment.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

But Sundance isn&#39;t giving up on the digital platforms it used to stream films and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sundance-film-festival-ar-vr-new-frontier-200029918.html">bring cinephiles into a VR social hub</a> last January. As part of its New Frontier exhibition, Sundance plans to expand The Spaceship, its virtual venue where attendees can chat together and explore VR and mixed reality art installations.</p><p>In an effort to connect Sundance&#39;s in-person attendees with its global online audience, the Festival will also launch a &quot;Biodigital Bridge&quot; in Park City. Shari Frilot, Sundance&#39;s Senior Programmer and Chief Curator of New Frontier, describes it as a human-scale screen where physical and digital attendees will be able to interact with each other. Developed together with the <a href="https://activetheory.net/home">immersive studio Active Theory</a>, the bridge will offer basic chat support, but it&#39;s mostly a way for Sundance-goers to see how other attendees enjoy the event.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abd510-4ba6-11ec-bda7-e2fce30f42be" alt="Sundance New Frontier curator Shari Frilot." data-uuid="4108bde2-89a1-385e-8044-286729043f77"><figcaption>Sundance New Frontier curator Shari Frilot.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sundance Film Festival</div></figure><p>Frilot says New Frontier has been pushing the concept of biodigital experiences for <a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/welcome-to-biodigital-theatre">several years now</a>, mostly through an exploration of how technology can intersect with our lives. Think of the way that an app like Uber, or even Google Maps, has reshaped the way we navigate physical spaces. But now that the pandemic has forced us to rely on our tech more than ever — Sundance wouldn&#39;t have been possible without it last year, after all — the term seems practically prescient. It&#39;s more than just a buzzword: Frilot says she&#39;s interested in exploring the technology that best serves humanity, or Team Human, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-douglas-rushkoff-sxsw-team-human.html">media theorist Douglas Rushkoff put it</a>.</p><p>Last year, I found <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sundance-film-festival-ar-vr-new-frontier-200029918.html">Sundance&#39;s online platform last year</a> to be a fascinating way to explore the festival and interact with fans. The core of the experience is the aforementioned Spaceship, which allows attendees on computers and VR headsets to mull about together. On a laptop or desktop, it resembles a stripped down version of Second Life. You walk around as simplistic avatars, and if you choose, you can also flip on your webcam, which fills your avatar&#39;s head with a live video feed. Since Sundance&#39;s platform is built on WebXR, a way to deliver virtual reality over the web, you can enter that same space in VR by slipping on any headset and visiting Sundance&#39;s website.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc20-4ba6-11ec-beef-5a7a3ecb7158" alt="Sundance Film Festival 2022 New Frontier" data-uuid="e4873a52-a56b-3961-98a5-79ec69abbcfd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sundance Film Festival</div></figure><p>Compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sxsw-2021-vr-finding-pandora-x-193201426.html">SXSW&#39;s VR platform</a>, which looked beautiful but mostly felt like a virtual wasteland, it was clear that Sundance got something right last year. After isolating for most of 2020, being able to see many of my cinephile friends in VR made last year&#39;s Sundance feel special. So for next year, Frilot says, the festival is going even further. The Spaceship will be upgraded with a new Cinema House, where attendees on computers and VR headsets can view events livestreamed from Park City, as well as room-scale discussions.</p><p>On the ground, Sundance will also have a new space called The Craft, which will let in-person attendees visit New Frontier exhibits, artist discussions and panels. There will also be VR headsets to use, though the festival is also encouraging people to bring their own gear if they&#39;ve got it. Sundance hasn&#39;t finalized its list of New Frontier exhibits yet, but Frilot tells me many artists are optimizing for the Oculus Quest 2, so fest-goers can experience their work without being connected to a PC. But there will likely still be pieces that demand a serious VR rig. Sundance&#39;s famed Egyptian theater will also host some New Frontier performances, which will occur both on the ground and virtually on the Spaceship.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5976386d16744076aba6a3b7014aaae9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52ac4a40-4ba6-11ec-bc5f-54b08eeb1e88" alt="Sundance&#39;s new virtual Cinema House."></section><p>You&#39;ll need a <a href="https://festival.sundance.org/tickets/">$50 Sundance Explorer Pass</a> to access all of these virtual goodies, which is double what it cost last year. It&#39;s a shame to see the price jump so quickly, but it&#39;s also reflective of the deeper commitment the festival is making in its digital platforms. Notably, the Explorer Pass is also open to people around the world, whereas Sundance&#39;s virtual screenings are limited to U.S. attendees.</p><p>&quot;[The virtual platform] is not just this thing that we&#39;re trying, we&#39;re actually doubling down on this,&quot; Frilot says. &quot;This points to the vital landscape of how cinema and storytelling is going to manifest [going forward]. We&#39;re here to not only contribute to it, but to meet it and support it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sundance-vr-2022-film-festival-154350393.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d196ae8-268f-418c-a5bc-ffce0c0e949a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:43:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637595835</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T15:44:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Festivals, Concerts & Shows]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc21-4ba6-11ec-bfd5-74c0d25e58b3" width="1409" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52abfc21-4ba6-11ec-bfd5-74c0d25e58b3" width="1409" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundance Film Festival]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Film Party hub on Sundance's virtual Spaceship.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sundance Film Festival 2022 New Frontier]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Instant Pot Duo Plus is already half off for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those who haven&#39;t jumped on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pot bandwagon</a> yet, the holiday shopping season is a great time to buy one because you&#39;ll find most models on sale.

It combines nine cooking methods in one device: pressure cooking, slow cooking, sautéing, rice cooking, yogurt making, steaming, warming, sous vide cooking and sterilizing. It also has a number of quick-cooking modes, including slow cook, soup, eggs and rice, that can be activated with just one button press. All that is to say that this one device can prepare a bunch of different foods in various ways, without much hassle on the part of the home cook. The inner pot is made of food-grade stainless steel and is dishwasher safe, too, so cleanup is a breeze as well. And with this model&#39;s six-quart capacity, you&#39;ll be able to make a full meal for a mid-sized family or a group of visiting friends easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Air frying is a big trend right now and thankfully you don&#39;t have to buy a dedicated air fryer to get those results. A few Instant Pot models have an air fry mode, but they require a special lid. The Instant Pot Pro Crisp is one such model that comes with the necessary lid (along with the standard multi-cooker lid) and it&#39;s $80 off right now, bringing it down to $170. This model has 11 cooking modes, the two included lids plus additional accessories like an air fryer basket and a dehydrating/broiling tray. It&#39;s also an eight-quart machine, making it even better than the discounted Duo Plus for large families and gatherings.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

As reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/19/google-messages-imessage-reaction-emoji/"><em><ins>9to5 Google</ins></em></a>, the app now turns Tapbacks into emoji.</p><p>Until now, Messages has converted Tapbacks into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-06-google-messages-rcs-reaction-texts.html"><ins>&quot;fallback&quot; text</ins></a>. So, if an Android user sent a message to an iPhone owner reading &quot;see you in ten?&quot; and their iOS buddy used the thumbs up reaction, Messages displayed that response as its own line of text (i.e. &quot;liked &#39;see you in ten?&#39;&quot;). That often made conversations far messier than they needed to be, especially in group chats.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-reactions-211218244.html"><ins>brought emoji reactions to Messages</ins></a> on RCS-compatible Android devices last year, but there are some differences from iOS Tapbacks. While Apple uses a heart icon, a &quot;ha ha&quot; label and other punctuation, Google uses emoji. So, the Android app appears to convert the heart into a face with heart eyes, &quot;ha ha&quot; into a laughing face and so on. Some nuance might get lost in translation, but it&#39;s still far cleaner than Google&#39;s previous method of displaying Tapbacks.</p><p>Word of the change first emerged via <em>9to5 Google</em>&#39;s deep dive into the latest Messages beta. Google is now rolling out the update. We&#39;re not quite at the stage where iMessage is on Android, but at least Google is playing a little nicer with iOS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-android-imessage-reactions-emoji-150947375.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b84676b4-6417-420d-867a-ee03664cae1e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:09:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637593790</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T15:09:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f2ddca0-4ba5-11ec-af7b-ea5b1e5ba87c" width="752" height="447" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f2ddca0-4ba5-11ec-af7b-ea5b1e5ba87c" width="752" height="447" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tapback reactions on Apple's Messages app, with the heart option highlighted.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tapback reactions on Apple's Messages app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GoDaddy discloses recent security breach that exposed 1.2 million accounts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1609711/000160971121000122/gddyblogpostnov222021.htm">disclosures</a> to the Securities and Exchange Commission, web registrar and hosting company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/godaddy-sent-fake-phising-email-promising-holiday-bonus-220756457.html">GoDaddy</a> has revealed that it discovered it had been hacked.

The audience seems to be, well, the fittest friends and acquaintances you know. The ones that know what they can benchpress, their fastest 5K time, or their VO2 Max. The latter is not a haircare product.</p><p>Prevayl’s sweet spot is this area between amateur athlete and biometric obsessive, and it’s approaching the fitness tech fight with style. It has a slick promotional video featuring pro athletes, a moody black logo and a surprisingly slick, well designed app. (Seriously, it amazes me how poor most entry-level fitness apps can still look.) And the shirt? Well, it looks good on the athletes.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cc9a4f938a3c466b99af230cbbc163b6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bfe7-63c0c79b9f14" alt="Prevayl smart shirt"></section><p>At a preview event in London, the team set me up in one of their first shirts, ahead of a planned launch early next year. It feels like a premium, luxury sports tee. It’s breathable, soft to the touch and <em>tight</em>. An elasticated band across the chest on all of the garments houses the conductive sensors, connected with graphene-augmented knitted electrodes. The fibers connecting these sensors look like metallic shoelaces and are machine washable. The shirt can go straight into a warm laundry wash; you just need to ensure you’ve taken the sensor out from the tiny pocket on the front of the clothing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bbed-2e49a491e595" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="8af94e6e-a70c-362a-93ca-cd30ff20ff81"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no need to fasten the sensor in place, as it comes in contact with the conductive fabric as soon as it’s in the front of the shirt. The sensor itself is an evolution from the chunky haphazard sensor unit design of smartwear’s past. The sensor has a plastic stopper that protects the USB-C charging port, while the charging cable is a small, machined aluminum clasp that magnetically folds in on itself.</p><p>The company makes everything here in-house, and Crofts believes this is why Prevayl can do things differently. “Usually, it’s been tech [companies] trying to make clothing or visa versa.” The company’s approach to the clothing itself was “style led” design. Prevayl’s head office has entire machines and technicians dedicated to knitting the clothing part of the equation.</p><p>Despite the sensor itself being so small, it’s packed with tech. There’s a “clinical-grade” ECG, that tracks your workout with four times the frequency of Polar heart rate monitors. It also monitors breathing frequency, motion and even body temperature. There’s even a bioimpedance sensor, which can be used for body composition scans, but there didn’t seem to be any feature that takes advantage of that yet. Prevayl is trying to do it all.</p><p>The company puts all this biometric data to use through many of the features and guidance you’ve seen on other fitness devices and services. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pga-tour-whoop-wearable-player-biometrics-100048054.html">Whoop</a>, the system can be used to gauge whether your body has <a href="https://www.whoop.com/experience/">fully recovered</a> from a workout; like MyZone’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/myzone-mz-switch-heart-rate-monitor-130550081.html">traffic light system</a>, it color-codes your workout effort into five categories, measuring both how hard you’re working out and when your heart rate has recovered. This is all in addition to tracking your heart-rate, caloric burn and more. Within the app, you can even see an accurate cardiogram of your heart as it beats away.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-be97-e63e3dbfd165" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="d641e81e-33d2-3f93-bf79-37a930e340e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the bigger challenges, which many fitness trackers and wearables struggle with, is ensuring a decent level of accuracy. Crofts mentioned multiple times during our interview that the company has been obsessed with gathering data.</p><p>The company worked with the UK’s University of Salford to validate the accuracy of its ECG unit. The team also recruited professional athletes, including British Olympic and Paralympic athletes and professional sportspeople, to test its prototypes and offer up crucial data for the team to chew over. The next stage is testing with more typical gym-goers, weekend warriors and the marginal gain-chaser, kicking off this month.</p><p>Even sized at a large, my tee felt a little too snug. I know many of us aren’t fans of the compression fit, but this, a tank top and crop top are the only options for now. Fortunately, Prevayl is working on loose fit and long-sleeved options, which I’d find more appealing. More colors, beyond Personal Trainer Black (my name, not theirs), are also incoming. The issue remains, though: If you wanted to use this system frequently, you will need more than one top. Or to do a daily laundry run.</p><p>As the sensor is removable, this should strip away some (most?) of the cost of additional shirts. But Prevayl wants to invade the luxury sportswear segment and that means prices to reflect that ambition. To begin with, it will cost you at least £120, which is roughly equivalent to $160. <a href="https://shop.prevayl.com/product">This starter kit </a>includes a sensor priced at £60, and a tank top. Not including the sensor, the Smart Tank will cost £60, while the Smarts Sports Bra will be £65. The Smart T-Shirt, which I tested, will cost £70. The impressive specs and tight app integration will go up against the expensive cost of entry.</p><p>Judging from my demo with Prevayl’s team (and my own early testing), the product is already looking polished. I spoke with a fitness professional at my local gym who, conveniently, had also tested out Prevayl. She noted that any new smartwear product would have to fight against incumbent chest straps and fitness trackers. Unlike a smartwatch, it’s nearly impossible to wear this top in tandem with a chest strap from another manufacturer. People are creators of habit — especially when it comes to exercise. People swear by Strada or their Apple Watch because it’s familiar and consistent. At this early stage, Prevayl’s online community isn’t yet live.</p><p>For now, the company is focusing on the UK and Ireland, but Prevayl’s spokesperson told me that the US will be a priority. I’m planning to test the smart shirt further, but I might have to invest in more items if I want to get serious about using Prevayl regularly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/prevayl-smartwear-smart-shirt-fitness-workout-150040128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87403336-9186-48ac-a64c-14b6a32444ff</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637592592</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T14:50:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-bfcd-6f4af0a6953e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-bfcd-6f4af0a6953e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prevayl smart shirt]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Prevayl smart shirt]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crucial's 1TB MX500 internal SSD is back on sale for $85]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s frustrating to run out of space on your desktop or laptop, but you can turn to storage devices for extra room and now&#39;s a good time to look for them if you&#39;re getting short on space. Black Friday deals have already popped up on some of our favorite models, including those from Crucial. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB MX500 internal SSD" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">1TB MX500 internal SSD</a> is on sale for $85, which is 15 percent off its normal price and only a few dollars shy of a record low. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2TB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">2TB</a> model is down to $168 as well, and if you don&#39;t need that much extra space, you can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:500GB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">500GB</a> version for only $53.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba" id="9c3ab95ef2c14a3a9e6ef59a06ff5d23" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial MX500 (1TB) at Amazon - $85</a><p>The MX500 should fit into most computers thanks to its 2.5-inch design, and it supports sequential read speeds of up to 560 MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 510 MB/s. It also comes with AES 256-bit hardware encryption as well as integrated power-loss immunity, the latter of which should protect your data even if your power gets cut unexpectedly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re looking for an internal drive that&#39;s a bit more high-end, or one that works with the PS5, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC">Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus</a> in 1TB is down to $145, which is 19 percent off its regular rate and an all-time low. This drive made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">PS5 SSD guide</a> because, even at its normal price, it&#39;s a solid budget option for the console as long as you&#39;re willing to supply your own heatsink. It&#39;s an NVMe PCIe SSD with read speeds up to 6,600 MB/s and write speeds up to 5,000 MB/s, and it&#39;s optimized for high-performance gaming and computing.</p><p>For those with tighter budgets who still want to expand their PS5 storage options, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s X6" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf">Crucial&#39;s X6</a> external drive in 1TB is 38 percent off right now, bringing it down to $80. Yes, you can use portable SSDs with the console, but there are some limitations: when connected to a PS5, an external drive can only be used to play PS4 titles or store PS5 games. That means you can move a PS5 title out of cold storage when you want to play it, which may be best if you have slower internet speeds impeding your ability to download games quickly. We like the X6 for its fast 540 MB/s read speeds, durable design that&#39;s shock, drop, vibration and temperature resistant and its compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC" id="a63144a263674c3884a2cfb8cdcc79dc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial P5 Plus (1TB) at Amazon - $145</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf" id="e08f7504c3364993b06ddf25f497be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial X6 (1TB) at Amazon - $80</a><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
