Other players such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-vivo-apex-2020-gimbal-camera-zoom.html">Vivo</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-12-oppo-find-x2-camera-all-pixel-omni-directional-pdaf.html">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-oppo-under-screen-selfie-camera-demo.html">Xiaomi</a> had also been testing this futuristic tech, but given the subpar image quality back then, it&#39;s no wonder that phone makers largely stuck with punch-hole cameras for selfies.</p><p>Despite much criticism of its first under-screen camera, ZTE worked what it claims to be an improved version into its new <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-5g-under-display-camera-120041472.html">Axon 30 5G</a>, which launched in China last week. Coincidentally, today Oppo unveiled its third-gen under-screen camera which, based on a sample shot it provided, appears to be surprisingly promising — no noticeable haziness nor glare. But that was just one photo, of course, so I&#39;ll obviously reserve my final judgement until I get to play with one. Even so, the AI tricks and display circuitry that made this possible are intriguing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a13119c0-f476-11eb-b5d3-8db0014d2c5d" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="bf22a4ea-1510-3fc2-9bf9-cd1a721bb8ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>In a nutshell, nothing has changed in terms of how the under-screen camera sees through the screen. Its performance is limited by how much light can travel through the gaps between each OLED pixel. Therefore, AI compensation is still a must. For its latest under-screen camera, Oppo says it trained its own AI engine &quot;using tens of thousands of photos&quot; in order to achieve more accurate corrections on diffraction, white balance and HDR. Hence the surprisingly natural-looking sample shot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8153c080-f476-11eb-b579-24b6053eb2ad" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="a614d4fe-7ca3-37fd-88d9-eabdfb41d2be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Another noteworthy improvement here lies within the display panel&#39;s consistency. The earlier designs chose to lower the pixel density in the area above the camera, in order to let sufficient light into the sensor. This resulted in a noticeable patch above the camera, which would have been a major turn-off when you watched videos or read fine text on that screen.</p><p>But now, Oppo — or the display panel maker, which could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-will-launch-new-foldables-and-make-the-category-mainstream-054254837.html">Samsung</a> — figured out a way to boost light transmittance by slightly shrinking each pixel&#39;s geometry above the camera. In order words, we get to keep the same 400-ppi pixel density as the rest of the screen, thus creating a more consistent look.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a10acd10-f476-11eb-bf94-0988da44a582" alt="Oppo&#39;s next-gen under-screen camera" data-uuid="94978d0a-40c2-3f67-8dbb-0e2b21ff6eeb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo added that this is further enhanced by a transparent wiring material, as well as a one-to-one pixel-circuit-to-pixel architecture (instead of two-to-one like before) in the screen area above the camera. The latter promises more precise image control and greater sharpness, with the bonus being a 50-percent longer panel lifespan due to better burn-in prevention.</p><p>Oppo didn&#39;t say when or if consumers will get to use its next-gen under-screen camera, but given the timing, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this turns out to be the same solution on the ZTE Axon 30 5G. In any case, it would be nice if the industry eventually agreed to dump punch-hole cameras in favor of invisible ones.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e0d5086-f928-4618-b6fd-58613766154f</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 03:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628022137</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T20:22:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/512e01e0-f476-11eb-a6f3-0b5b1f4fa8d4" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/512e01e0-f476-11eb-a6f3-0b5b1f4fa8d4" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oppo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo's next-gen under-screen camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo's next-gen under-screen camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Diablo Immortal' has been postponed until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-02-diablo-immortal-brings-blizzards-action-rpg-to-ios-and-androi.html"><em>Diablo Immortal</em></a> may be a game for tiny screens, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a small feat of development. For precisely this reason, Activision Blizzard has delayed the release of <em>Diablo Immortal </em>to early 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The action RPG was originally supposed to hit iOS and Android devices this year, but developers need more time to fine-tune PvP content, improve PvE experiences and implement additional accessibility options, according to <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo-immortal/23706474/diablo-immortal-development-update">Blizzard</a>. Here&#39;s how developers put it in their blog post:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Following feedback provided by test participants of the Closed Alpha, our team has been tuning core and endgame features. For example, we’re iterating on PvP content like the Cycle of Strife to make it more accessible, alongside late-game PvE content like the Helliquary to make it more engaging. We’re also working to provide controller support for those who want to play our game in a different way. However, these changes and additional opportunities to improve our gameplay experience will not be realized in the 2021 timeframe we had previously communicated. So, the game is now planned for release in the first half of 2022, which will allow us to add substantial improvements to the whole game.</p></blockquote><p>Blizzard goes on to describe specific features it&#39;ll focus on, such as adding PvE Raids, adjusting Bounties and making Challenge Rifts more exciting. In terms of PvP adjustments, Blizzard will work on improving matchmaking, earning rankings, class balance, time to kill and other elements of the Battleground system, plus it&#39;ll spit-shine the Cycle of Strife endgame content. All of this joins a raft of changes to progression and XP caps.</p><p>It seems developers are still in the early stages when it comes to getting <em>Diablo Immortal </em>to play nice with gamepads.</p><p>&quot;We&#39;re still working through the challenges of adapting the touch screen controls to a controller seamlessly,&quot; the blog reads. &quot;Making our game more accessible is top of mind, and we’ll share more progress on this front as we approach the beta in the future.&quot;</p><p>Blizzard has <em>other </em>things on its plate right now, too. Activision Blizzard is facing a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">sexual harassment and gender discrimination lawsuit</a> from the state of California, and Blizzard president J. Allen Brack <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">left the company today</a> amid allegations that he overlooked abuse in the workplace for years. Blizzard&#39;s head of HR, Jesse Meschuk, also left the studio this week. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">second lawsuit</a> was filed by shareholders today, claiming Activision Blizzard failed to disclose potential regulatory issues related to the company&#39;s discriminatory, frat-house-style culture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/diablo-immortal-delay-2022-blizzard-225447721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7527ae09-1a55-4efb-90b6-e29a3ecea722</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 22:54:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628030638</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T22:44:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fada4bc0-f4aa-11eb-9f3f-169363585558" width="2684" height="1510" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fada4bc0-f4aa-11eb-9f3f-169363585558" width="2684" height="1510" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blizzard]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Diablo Immortal]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp adds disappearing ‘view once’ photos to its app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is adding <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/view-once-photos-and-videos-on-whatsapp/"><ins>disappearing</ins></a> photo messages to its app. Called “view once” photos, the new feature allows users to send photos and videos in chats that can only be viewed a single time before disappearing.</p><p>The Snapchat-like feature is similar to Instagram and Messenger’s disappearing photo <a href="https://help.instagram.com/1310346208996329"><ins>features</ins></a>.

Michael Shulan, the museum&#39;s former creative director and a central figure in the film, reportedly claims in the movie that the museum represents the “Disneyfication” of the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks.</p><p>Film distribution is a tough nut to crack for indie studios and filmmakers, especially when they try to release movies in a number of markets. Much like others have had success in hosting online classes or livestreaming gameplay on Facebook, they could harness the platform&#39;s enormous reach to find an audience.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether other filmmakers and distributors premiere their movies on Facebook. Still, with the company having its fingers in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bulletin-newsletters-180747141.html">ever-increasing number of pies</a>, it&#39;s not hard to imagine Facebook being interested in hosting similar events in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-movie-premiere-paid-event-9-11-museum-documentary-193049697.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8c92a0b-3983-40e5-82b7-1dfae46c48b9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 19:30:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628018392</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T19:20:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/2234dce0-4370-11eb-beb9-86cefc1585fc" width="5616" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/2234dce0-4370-11eb-beb9-86cefc1585fc" width="5616" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[nopow via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A vintage 8mm film projector projects a blank image with film dust and scratches onto a wall beside a stack of film reels]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Film Projector with Blank Frame]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix is making a documentary about SpaceX's upcoming Inspiration4 civilian flight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html">Inspiration4</a>, SpaceX’s first all-civilian flight, takes off next month, Netflix will chronicle the historic mission with a documentary series. <em>Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission to Space</em> will stream in five parts, with the first two episodes debuting on September 6th.

Their research could pave the way for Facebook to target ads based on encrypted WhatsApp messages. Facebook could also use the findings to encrypt user data without affecting its ad targeting approaches.</p><p>This area of research is called &quot;homomorphic encryption,&quot; which relies heavily on mathematics. Microsoft, Amazon and Google are also working on the approach. The aim of homomorphic encryption is to allow companies to read and analyze data while keeping it encrypted to protect information from cybersecurity dangers and to maintain privacy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook told <em>The Information</em> it&#39;s &quot;too early for us to consider homomorphic encryption for WhatsApp at this time.&quot; Facebook could benefit from the tech in a number of ways. Protecting data without impacting the effectiveness of ad targeting could allow Facebook to both meet its business goals and satisfy regulators who have expressed concern about how the company handles user information. Facebook could be years away from harnessing homomorphic encryption, however.</p><p>In 2019, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-mark-zuckerberg-outlines-facebook-privacy-rethink.html"><ins>revealed plans</ins></a> to roll out end-to-end encryption across all of its messaging services: Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Later that year, the US, UK and Australia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-doj-facebook-end-to-end-encryption-whatsapp-instagram-messenger.html"><ins>sent a joint letter</ins></a> to Facebook, urging it not to push forward with the project &quot;without ensuring there will be no reduction in the safety of Facebook users and others, and without providing law enforcement court-authorized access to the content of communications to protect the public, particularly child users.&quot; However you slice it, encryption is a thorny issue for Facebook, whether or not it&#39;s able to analyze the data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-analyze-encrypted-messages-ad-targeting-175739715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dbe46a40-8148-4d74-bfda-7b5b9fa39392</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 17:57:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628012569</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T17:42:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/379f6e60-3ecb-11ea-b7fd-309fb1b5d8c8" width="5184" height="3163" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/379f6e60-3ecb-11ea-b7fd-309fb1b5d8c8" width="5184" height="3163" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arnd Wiegmann / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of Facebook is seen in Davos, Switzerland Januar 20, 2020.

The Protect plan, which almost 100,000 users have beta tested, offers around-the-clock access to &quot;Citizen’s team of highly trained Protect Agents,&quot; CEO Andrew Frame <a href="https://medium.com/citizen/citizen-protect-officially-launches-today-21fa717d648b">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><p>Those agents can call 911 for you if you&#39;re in a situation in which contacting emergency services directly might not be safe. &quot;If you share your location with Citizen Protect, Agents can live monitor your location, provide first responders, and help them arrive more quickly by guiding them to your exact location,&quot; Frame wrote. &quot;Protect Agents will always continue to monitor you while you wait for help to arrive.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The agents can notify your emergency contacts and keep them updated if you&#39;re in trouble. Frame said they can also guide you to a safe place or help nearby when needed, or chat with you for peace of mind. The service can also alert other Citizen users in the area if your scenario warrants doing so. &quot;Harnessing the power of Citizen’s safety network through Protect-generated alerts has helped dozens of families reunite with their missing loved ones and pets,&quot; Frame wrote.</p><p>Users can connect to a Protect agent and chat via video, audio or text after tapping a button on the Citizen app&#39;s home screen. The iOS version of the app includes an optional Protect Mode, which offers other ways to link up with an agent (Citizen plans to bring &quot;additional functionality&quot; to Android soon). You can switch on a feature that displays a prompt to connect to an agent when you shake your device a couple of times.</p><p>If you opt to use the Distress Detection feature, Citizen will monitor your device&#39;s audio with &quot;AI-powered technology which identifies sounds that indicate trouble, like a scream for example.&quot; If the app picks up an audible distress signal, it&#39;ll ask if you&#39;d like to be connected to an agent. If 10 seconds pass without you responding to the prompt, Citizen will connect you to an agent automatically.</p><p>Citizen started out in 2016 as an app called Vigilante that aimed to alert users about crimes and emergencies. Apple swiftly kicked it from the App Store over vigilantism concerns. Vigilante was rebranded a few months later with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-09-citizen-app.html">a deeper focus on safety</a>.</p><p>The app hit headlines again in May, when Citizen <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/18/business/citizen-app-arson-wildfire-devin-hilton.html">offered a $30,000 reward</a> for information that led to the arrest of a person who it claimed started a wildfire.

Microsoft — more specifically, Xbox — loves to tie its onyx consoles to food companies, soft drinks and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-mini-fridge-release-date-191211916.html">the rest</a>. While promoting the Xbox One X in the US alone, there were <a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2017/11/01/how-brand-partnerships-and-promos-helped-bring-the-xbox-one-x-life">collaborations</a> with Taco Bell, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-31-win-a-xbox-one-via-doritos-mountain-dew-promotion-online-at-pa.html">Doritos, Mountain Dew </a>and, er, Totino’s pizza rolls.</p><p>On the other hand, I also like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/krispy-kreme-xbox-doughnuts-122614458.html">doughnuts</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8cb10580-f473-11eb-93eb-bbcc3fb87003" alt="Krispy Kreme&#39;s Xbox doughnut" data-uuid="7cfda162-3de7-3446-b981-6880f9e4de6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>In the UK, American doughnut company Krispy Kreme is celebrating the Xbox’s 20th anniversary with an iced donut decorated to look like the console’s nexus symbol. If you’re willing to buy a box of 12, you’ll also get a code with a chance to win a Series X. However, I live alone and have poor self-control, so I bought a box of three — for the photos, of course.</p><p>I don’t think green is a particularly appetizing color for pastry treats, but it sells Xbox the brand — sort of? The color seems closer to Krispy Kreme’s shade of green, and not quite as vivid as the almost-lime Xbox logo. The thin layer of green icing doesn’t have a flavor, and there’s a dusting of powdered sugar to indicate the collaboration. Otherwise, yes, it’s a filled Krispy Kreme, puffy delicious yeast-raised donut. I’m not here to debate cake versus yeast donuts — please take it out on me over on Twitter.</p><p>Then I bit in deeper. Maybe it’s the Mountain Dew tie-ins <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-08-09-the-x3f-halo-3-game-fuel-taste-test.html">with video gaming&#39;s past,</a> but I feared some sort of aggressive citrus jam/jelly or neon fondant nonsense.

Earlier this year, YouTube <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-creators-fund-100-million-172643630.html">announced a $100 million fund</a> specifically to pay creators who use the platform&#39;s new Shorts format, which just came out of beta and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-available-globally-161554248.html">rolled out to 100 countries</a> last month. That fund is now live as of today, so the company is dropping more details on how you can get paid.</p><p>As YouTube announced earlier this year, the company plans to invite &quot;thousands of eligible creators&quot; to claim a payment from the program from now through 2022; YouTube is offering from $100 to $10,000, depending on how many people watch the Short as well as some other engagement metrics. Anyone posting shorts is theoretically eligible to get picked for a payment, not just creators who participate in the YouTube Partner Program (that&#39;s the program YouTube launched 14 years ago so that users could get paid for their content).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, there are a number of standards that these Shorts need to meet to be eligible. Most of them are pretty straightforward, like abiding by YouTube&#39;s community guidelines and copyright policies. YouTube also doesn&#39;t want people just re-uploading content they created for Snapchat or TikTok, so any Shorts with watermarks or logos from other social networks won&#39;t qualify. YouTube says it&#39;ll be awarding payments on a monthly basis so interested creators will be incentivized to keep making new Shorts.</p><p>While YouTube Shorts is a relatively new platform, TikTok <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html">has had a similar fund</a> for its creators since 2020. It was announced as a $200 million fund, double what YouTube currently has budgeted for its Shorts fund, and those interested would have to submit their best work. But while TikTok&#39;s fund may be larger than this Shorts program, YouTube notes that it has nine other ways for its creators to monetize their content.</p><p>While YouTube Shorts is a relatively new platform, TikTok has had a similar fund for its creators since 2020.

Perhaps more significantly than the sheer dollar value is the fact that Facebook isn&#39;t going to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-creators-earnings-cut-2023-paid-events-newsletters-164341439.html">collect a cut of creators&#39; revenue through 2022</a>, making a focus on the platform even more potentially lucrative. The size of this move is an admission from Facebook that it&#39;s a little behind the curve here; Instagram didn&#39;t offer any kind of revenue share until last year, in fact.&nbsp;</p><p>Between TikTok&#39;s massive influence and Facebook&#39;s massive war chest aimed at creators, YouTube is going to need to keep offering its users more ways to make cash — and the company knows it. Indeed, it said in today&#39;s news that the $100 million fund is the &quot;first step&quot; in its plans to monetize Shorts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-100-million-dollar-creator-fund-launch-160058966.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1bfaf629-2159-4d56-a919-da2aa0471ecc</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 16:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628003833</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T15:17:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32713c30-f468-11eb-bf3c-057d62994ba7" width="2572" height="1612" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32713c30-f468-11eb-bf3c-057d62994ba7" width="2572" height="1612" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube Shorts]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube Shorts]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps for iOS gets dark mode and new location sharing features]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the past year, Google Maps has received tons of new features to help you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-indoor-live-view-eco-friendly-routes-pickup-and-delivery-integration-100020907.html">get around</a>, pay for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-updates-parking-transit-payments-140018073.html">parking</a> and keep abreast of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-community-feed-200004092.html">new services</a> in your vicinity. With its latest iOS update, Google is breaking out more of its most-used functions to help you access them faster. It&#39;s also adding a dark mode to lower the strain on your eyes and a new live location option for iMessage that can help you track friends and loved ones.&nbsp;</p><p>The latter lets you share your real-time location while texting by tapping the Google Maps button. Though the feature is active for one hour by default, you can choose to extend it to up to three days or disable it by pressing the stop button. Live location recalls the safety features built into ride-hailing apps like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-17-uber-trip-tracker-follow-family-members-in-real-time.html">Uber</a> and Lyft.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you frequently use Google Maps to check traffic conditions, you can now put that info directly on your home screen with a new widget. The same goes for the search bar, which lets you look up places to visit or find frequent destinations with a tap.

The tech firm has <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/pdf/Mac_Pro_White_Paper_Aug_2021.pdf">updated</a> the Mac Pro with new high-end GPU options that promise big strides forward for graphics- and compute-intensive apps. AMD&#39;s Radeon Pro W6800X, W6800X Duo (shown here) and W6900X cards tout 50 percent improved performance per watt over their Vega II predecessors, Apple claimed, and that translates to significant speed boosts in relevant apps.</p><p>You can expect up to 84 percent better performance in the Octane X rendering app, Apple said. The 26 percent and 23 percent claimed jumps in Cinema 4D and DaVinci Resolve aren&#39;t quite so impressive-sounding, but they&#39;re still meaningful if you&#39;re either buying a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-mac-pro-2019-pro-xdr-first-look.html">Mac Pro</a> or upgrading from one of the more modest GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple isn&#39;t shy about the origins — these are workstation-oriented parallels to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review-gpus-140014999.html">Radeon RX 6800</a> and 6900 series consumer boards. The biggest differences, as you might guess, are tweaks to cater to the pro market. All of them include four Thunderbolt 3 ports and an HDMI 2 connector, and they support an Infinity Fabric Link that lets up to four GPUs (such as two W6800X Duo modules) talk to each other five times faster than PCIe. Both individual GPUs include 32GB of GDDR6 memory, while the W6800X Duo unsurprisingly includes 64GB.</p><p>These GPUs are replacing the Vega II and Vega II Duo cards in the lineup, and they&#39;re priced accordingly. It will cost you $2,400 extra to configure a new Mac Pro with the W6800X inside, $4,600 for the W6800X Duo, and $5,600 for the W6900X. Go all-out and you can spend $9,600 on two W6800X Duos or a staggering $11,600 on two W6900X modules.</p><p>The Mac Pro has otherwise gone untouched with this update, and it won&#39;t be surprising if this is the only hardware refresh for Apple&#39;s pro tower in 2021. There <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/07/26/2022-mac-pro-said-to-use-intel-ice-lake-xeon-w-3300-cpus">are rumors</a> of Apple giving the Intel-based Mac Pro one last hurrah with an Ice Lake Xeon update, but that wouldn&#39;t happen until 2022. It might not happen at all when there&#39;s also talk of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">40-core Apple Silicon model</a> that same year. It&#39;s safe to say that you&#39;ll want to strongly consider a W6000-equipped Mac Pro if you absolutely depend on high-end x86 apps or just need the kind of macOS performance that only the Pro can currently deliver.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-pro-w6800x-w6900-gpu-154228019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7966ee69-50b1-43c5-a148-edb0d666c2f3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:42:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628005351</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T15:42:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7bdf93a0-f46b-11eb-aafa-b8e05737670e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7bdf93a0-f46b-11eb-aafa-b8e05737670e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac Pro with two Radeon Pro W6800X Duo GPUs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac Pro with two Radeon Pro W6800X Duo GPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senate report warns of glaring cybersecurity holes at federal agencies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Several US federal agencies are unprepared to protect the personal information of everyday Americans should they become the target of a cyberattack, according to a new <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Federal%20Cybersecurity%20-%20America&#39;s%20Data%20Still%20at%20Risk%20(FINAL).pdf">report</a> put together by the Senate Homeland Security Committee.

I am concerned that many of these vulnerabilities have been outstanding for the better part of a decade — the American people deserve better.&quot;</p><p>Among other recommendations, the report highlights the need for a single agency to oversee federal cybersecurity. To that end, the panel suggests Congress update the Federal Information Security Modernization Act to make the law better reflect current cybersecurity practices and establish the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jen-easterly-cisa-head-092048460.html">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</a> as the federal lead for those types of issues. It also recommends amending FISMA to require agencies to notify both CISA and, in some instances, Congress when they become entangled in a major incident.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-homeland-security-committee-federal-cybersecurity-report-153405169.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b26d898-dd9a-4eaa-bd96-b33a00d6fa7d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:34:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628004848</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T15:34:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ff5c640-f46c-11eb-bffb-5d043278738b" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ff5c640-f46c-11eb-bffb-5d043278738b" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Brenner / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) walks along news reporters before attending a vote, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 23, 2021.

NASA is launching Starliner Orbital Flight Test-2 from Cape Canaveral today (August 3rd) at 1:20PM Eastern, with a livestream available from NASA&#39;s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF9LpNpNjNI">channel</a> (below) starting at 12:30PM ET. If successful, the unoccupied spacecraft will deliver over 400lbs of cargo to the International Space Station before returning to Earth with 550lbs of material.</p><p>Starliner will start an orbital insertion burn about 30 minutes after launch. You&#39;ll have to be patient after that, though. The capsule isn&#39;t expected expected to dock with the ISS until August 4th at 1:37PM ET, and will touch down in the western US after its &quot;daylong&quot; mission.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The vessel was originally supposed to launch on July 30th, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-boeing-delay-starliner-iss-launch-092458695.html">was delayed</a> after the new Russian ISS module Nauka accidentally activated and forced a correction.</p><p>Much depends on a successful flight. Boeing and NASA will follow a successful test with six crew rotation missions. For Boeing, this is also about pride. SpaceX beat Boeing to the punch by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-dragon-successful-splashdown-184812158.html">successfully launching a crewed capsule</a> in 2020, and is already performing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-splashdown-record-144301622.html">crewed operational flights</a>. The sooner Starliner is cleared to launch with people aboard, the sooner Boeing can catch up and play a key role in the privatization of spaceflight.</p><div id="24229a4115e44b1cb712ac85e3f7139b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tF9LpNpNjNI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><strong>Update</strong>: Boeing <a href="https://twitter.com/boeingspace/status/1422574713176481795?s=21">has announced</a> that the launch won&#39;t happen today after all, due to &quot;unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system.&quot;</p><div id="c25372484ca9433aa9a7f1c7fd6179ec"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re standing down from today&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Starliner?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Starliner</a> Orbital Flight Test-2 launch. <br><br>During pre-launch preparations, our engineers detected unexpected valve position indications in the propulsion system.<br><br>Read the full statement: <a href="https://t.co/uQBjvq8ObU">https://t.co/uQBjvq8ObU</a><a href="https://t.co/4X2INbZj7Q">pic.twitter.com/4X2INbZj7Q</a></p>— Boeing Space (@BoeingSpace) <a href="https://twitter.com/BoeingSpace/status/1422574713176481795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-boeing-starliner-iss-launch-153058519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51486434-f005-4119-acfc-398283cf529b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 15:30:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628016381</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T18:46:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84b25070-f458-11eb-bd27-aa55389bc692" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84b25070-f458-11eb-bd27-aa55389bc692" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA/Joel Kowsky]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boeing Starliner aboard ULA Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Boeing Starliner aboard ULA Atlas V rocket at Cape Canaveral]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Magic Keyboard with Touch ID is now available separately for $149]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months after it introduced new Touch ID-enabled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/touch-id-apple-imac-wireless-174826559.html"><ins>Magic Keyboards</ins></a> along with M1 Macs, Apple is now selling the peripheral separately.

In addition to designing the curriculum, Intel has provided training and technical advice to the college faculty involved in the program. Dell is also helping with technical and infrastructure expertise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Carlos Contreras, senior director of AI and digital readiness at Intel, the program consists of four parts. In the initial “Awareness” section, a teacher introduces students to some of the “possibilities” and “issues” around AI, with an emphasis on class discussion. The following two parts involve a lot of hands-on learning while students are gradually introduced to the technical skills they need to become proficient in the field. The final part of the program, “Capstone,” sees students asked to create and present projects that use AI to impact society.</p><p>For Intel, the company says working with community colleges offers a chance to “democratize AI technology.” Citing <a href="https://www.aacc.nche.edu/research-trends/fast-facts/">data from the American Association of Community Colleges</a>, the company notes they attract people from various backgrounds and walks of life. But as with most programs of this type, it’s also an opportunity for the company to find candidates in a demanding field. It’s no accident then Intel plans to expand the program to include 50 more schools by 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ai-for-workforce-2021-expansion-130027058.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fbb046d-fd61-41f2-8050-33a185a156a2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628016497</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T18:48:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Schools]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/799696a0-f3be-11eb-8ffb-43a39e47ee85" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel AI for Workforce program]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JLab debuts $20 true wireless earbuds with 8-hour battery life and touch controls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, I found out just how solid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">a pair of $29 true wireless earbuds</a> could be. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-02-jlab-go-air-wireless-earbuds.html">JLab&#39;s Go Air</a> covers all the basics even though they lack the polish of more expensive sets. For its latest buds, <a href="https://www.jlab.com/products/go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds">the Go Air Pop</a>, the company is taking things a step further with better battery life and a fully enclosed charging case. JLab cut the price even more too: these earbuds will only cost you $20.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Go Air, you&#39;ll get all of the core functionality of true wireless earbuds with the Go Air Pop. That includes on-board touch controls, the ability to use either earbud independently, EQ presets and IPX4 moisture resistance. The overall design of the buds is also similar, although JLab says the Go Air Pop is 15 percent smaller and 40 percent lighter than the Go Air.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13b91bf0-f40e-11eb-a57d-e6fed4130f41" alt="JLab Go Air Pop" data-uuid="9a1f3b2f-d6c9-3b9e-86cc-a77467a1d9b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLab</div></figure><p>The biggest differences are the case and the battery life. The Go Air comes in an open case with an attached USB cable that tucks in the bottom. The integrated plug is back on the Go Air Pop, but the case has a lid like almost every other set of true wireless buds.  JLab extended battery life to eight hours on the buds themselves, up from five on the Go Air. The case will give you three additional charges before you&#39;ll need to plug the whole set in.&nbsp;</p><p>JLab isn&#39;t the only company cranking out sub-$30 true wireless earbuds. Skullcandy debuted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-dime-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-120012848.html">the $25 Dime</a> back in March, a set of buds with a more AirPod-like design. The Dime can only muster three and a half hours on a charge, but it does offer on-board controls and IPX4 water resistance for your workouts.&nbsp;</p><p>The Go Air Pop will ship in late August. When it does, you can choose between black, lilac, rose, slate and teal color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2799a6f1-c087-4045-a8a8-57e4f6152655</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 13:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627963302</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T04:01:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ee113770-f40d-11eb-9fce-d939360baebc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JLab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JLab Go Air Pop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Realme's 'MagDart' is an Android take on MagSafe, but faster]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever since Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-magsafe-iphone-173957651.html">MagSafe</a> made its grand return by way of the iPhone 12 series, it was only a matter of time before other phone makers came up with similar — and maybe better — solutions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/realme">Realme</a>, the sister brand of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oppo">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oneplus">OnePlus</a>, has announced its very own &quot;MagDart&quot; magnetic wireless charging system as part of its latest concept phone, the Flash.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5228b560-f451-11eb-bbbf-4037e39b11e5" style="height:1011;width:1600;" alt="Realme 50W MagDart" data-uuid="245e2e67-8483-3fe4-aa35-70ee20534983"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>Not only is MagDart the first of its kind in the Android world, it&#39;s also more powerful than Apple&#39;s MagSafe, with its maximum output rated at 50W instead of just 15W. This 50W magnetic charger leverages Realme&#39;s speedy 65W SuperDart charging tech — a rebranded version of Oppo&#39;s SuperVOOC and OnePlus&#39; Warp Charge 65 — and has its own air-cooling system for maximum performance. Realme claims that the charging speed here is almost on par with its 50W SuperDart wired charger. Specifically, for the 4,500mAh battery inside the Realme Flash, it&#39;ll go from zero to 100 percent in under an hour.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The downside of this 50W MagDart charger is its bulkiness, but Realme will also offer a slim 15W MagDart charging pad — one that&#39;s a tad thinner than Apple&#39;s MagSafe charger. This design is mainly thanks to having the circuit board tucked away in the plug, which also keeps the charging coil cooler for higher efficiency. For the same phone, this will take about 90 minutes to go from zero to 100 percent.</p><p>Naturally, the MagDart ecosystem offers a few other snap-on accessories as well. There&#39;s a MagDart power bank which one-ups the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-147-magsafe-battery-pack-apple-card-podcasts-homepod-192323154.html">MagSafe Battery Pack</a> by doubling as a wireless charging stand, so you can charge or grab both the phone and the power bank simultaneously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65a17320-f451-11eb-b976-2d90c15961fa" style="height:758;width:1516;" alt="MagDart 2-in-1 power bank, 50W MagDart charger, 15W MagDart charger, MagDart beauty light, MagDart wallet and MagDart case for Realme GT." data-uuid="6090cf69-d685-3473-8db4-45b43744fb02"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>There&#39;s also a MagDart Beauty Light, which is a flip-up ring light — consisting of 60 mini LEDs, with adjustable brightness and color temperature — to keep your selfie game strong. Interestingly, this kit is powered by the phone&#39;s reverse wireless charging feature.</p><p>Another handy accessory here is the self-explanatory MagDart Wallet, which holds up to three credit cards in its vegan leather pockets. Though unlike the MagSafe version, this one adds an aluminum kickstand to your phone as well.</p><p>Last but not least, existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-snapdragon-888-launch-price-availability-184917902.html">Realme GT</a> users can get a special case to make their phone MagDart-compatible, though this will add a slight bulge near the bottom on the back side.</p><p>There&#39;s no word on when we will see the first MagDart-compatible devices on the market just yet, but when that happens, chances are future products from Oppo and OnePlus will get to share the love with Realme (unless Apple gets in the way, of course). But if you use a pacemaker, then you&#39;ll probably want to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pacemaker-device-warning-list-210820634.html">avoid</a> those also.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/realme-flash-magdart-android-apple-magsafe-125551887.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0074099c-07a8-4feb-828f-b07b1dfb602a</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 12:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627995371</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:56:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32de4d50-f451-11eb-bdfe-de309c4bd94d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32de4d50-f451-11eb-bdfe-de309c4bd94d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Realme]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Realme Flash]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Realme Flash]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First-gen Echo Show 5 returns to an all-time low of $45 on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now grab the <a href="https://amzn.to/3jybf1F">first-gen Echo Show 5</a> for $45 on Amazon, if you didn&#39;t get the chance to do so on Prime Day in June and on Black Friday last year. The Alexa-powered smart display is also currently available for $45 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-gen-echo-show-5-lowest-price-best-buy-044542257.html">on Best Buy</a>, but you now have another option if you&#39;d rather purchase it from Amazon for Prime shipping or any other reason. While you can get a refurbished version for less elsewhere, this is the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for a brand new device that originally retails for $80.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3jybf1F">Buy Amazon Echo Show 5 (1st Gen) at Amazon - $45</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $45, that also makes this smart display $45 cheaper than the second-gen Echo Show 5. And, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">review of the newer device</a>, its changes are pretty minor. Instead of a one-megapixel camera, you now get 2 megapixels, which isn&#39;t that much of an upgrade. The newer smart display also comes in a light blue option, while its predecessor is only available in black and white. That&#39;s pretty much it, though — the display&#39;s resolution remains the same, and it still doesn&#39;t come with features its bigger counterpart, the Echo Show 8, has.</p><p>As we said in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">review</a> for the first-gen Echo Show 5, it&#39;s meant for those who want a smaller Amazon smart display that&#39;s also a decent alarm clock. It has a sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens the screen 15 minutes before the time you set, and it has ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the screen&#39;s brightness based on your surroundings. You can also use it to display photos and watch videos, though, if you don&#39;t mind the smaller screen. The device supports Amazon Prime, NBC and Hulu, and you can always access YouTube using its built-in browsers.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-gen-echo-show-5-all-time-low-amazon-122943901.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48f7402f-31e5-4a09-8887-7781f1bcf23d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 03 Aug 2021 12:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627993821</ingested><modified>2021-08-03T12:30:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8a7e2a50-f44f-11eb-8f77-673e3366979c" width="1500" height="990" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is offering $10 in credit for your palm print]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is offering $10 in promotional credit to get people to sign up to its palm print payments system. Our sister site <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/02/amazon-credit-palm-biometrics/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>spotted the promotional offer and shared a screenshot of it, which you can peep below. The retailer launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-palm-recognition-go-stores-seattle-100718649.html">Amazon One</a> last fall as a contactless way of authenticating purchases and allowing entry into stores using a biometric device. In this case, a palm scanner. With surface hygiene a major concern during the pandemic, the move made sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, Amazon has expanded the system to <a href="https://one.amazon.com/?ots=1&amp;slotNum=1&amp;imprToken=d0bd85cc-cd16-bd33-275&amp;ascsubtag=[]vg[p]22085309[t]w[r]google.com[d]D">53</a> of its physical retail spots in places including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Texas. You can find the tech at Amazon Go convenience stores, Whole Foods Market, Amazon Go Grocery, Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star stores and Amazon Pop Ups.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shoppers can enroll on Amazon One at those sites by pairing their credit card and mobile number with one or both of their palm signatures. The sign-up process is the only part that requires you to touch the device. After that, you just hover your palm over the scanner to enter a store and complete purchases. The promotion also requires you to link your Amazon account with your One ID.</p><p>The limited number of Amazon One locations means that the promo will be restricted to a small circle of users. But, if Amazon gets its way, the system may be hard to avoid in a contactless, check-out free future. It&#39;s already begun discussions to offer the tech to third-party retailers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a529160-f44c-11eb-befb-6e9eefcf4227" alt="Amazon One" data-uuid="7ae3a8a7-a743-3c5c-b277-51c74beab509"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon / TechCrunch</div></figure><p>Of course, the idea of handing over more data (especially biometric information) to Amazon may not sit right with some people.
