After installing the software, you can use the built-in assistant to send texts and make voice calls over Messenger. Additionally, it can now read out messages someone sends you over the chat platform.</p><p>One other new feature is the ability to use your voice to control media playback. For instance, if you want to skip to the next song in a playlist, say, “Hey Facebook, next.” It’s also possible to adjust the volume of audio in this same way, as well as pause and resume a song or podcast. Oh, and you can ask the assistant for a battery life update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta says it’s rolling out the update to the accompanying Facebook View app in phases and notes it expects the software to be available to everyone soon. Before you can download the update, you’ll need to install the latest firmware on your Stories glasses. While this release enhances one of the less compelling aspects of the Ray-Ban Stories, the company promised it will add more functionality in the new year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-ray-ban-stories-voice-update-194355398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d6aeb245-4332-43b3-bf93-756bb64651f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:43:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639597438</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T19:44:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b0a5d410-22dc-11ec-b6e1-bb1ae0ad1bdc" width="1920" height="1130" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b0a5d410-22dc-11ec-b6e1-bb1ae0ad1bdc" width="1920" height="1130" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ray-Ban Stories Wayfarer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ray-Ban Stories Wayfarer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A 'Splinter Cell' remake is underway]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rainbow-six-siege-sam-fisher-splinter-cell-221038644.html">some cameos</a> and talk of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splinter-cell-netlfix-animated-series-201748507.html">animated series</a>, Ubisoft is finally ready to make a new <em>Splinter Cell</em> game — in a manner of speaking. The game developer has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">revealed</a> plans for a <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake that aims to recreate the stealth action of the early games while embracing modern technology.</p><p>The project will use the Snowdrop engine present in newer games like <em>The Division 2</em> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-release-date-202716664.html"><em>Avatar</em> title</a>, but you&#39;ll play in small, linear environments rather than Ubi&#39;s signature (and frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/far-cry-6-release-date-gameplay-trailer-182030303.html">formulaic</a>) open-world spaces. The company wants to meet present-day gameplay expectations, but is also aware that early <em>Splinter Cell</em> was appealing precisely because it rewarded truly stealthy players who demonstrated patience, intelligence and methodical planning. Don&#39;t expect to survive a full-fledged gunfight, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s clearly too soon for Ubisoft to provide a release date for the remake, but the Toronto studio is helming the effort with a mix of veterans from previous <em>Splinter Cell</em> games and fresher faces that will include some new hires. Whether or not the team succeeds isn&#39;t clear. Ubisoft Toronto&#39;s one and only <em>Splinter Cell</em> game was <em>Blacklist</em>, which was well-received but not as revered as the original. The Toronto branch is also still grappling with the consequences of Ubi&#39;s misconduct scandals — VP and <em>Blacklist</em> co-director Maxime Béland <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-vice-president-resigns-assault-accusations-175852405.html">resigned following assault allegations</a>.</p><p>The gameplay promises might bode well if you were worried the remake would stray too far from what made <em>Splinter Cell</em> great, though. And crucially, this could be the launchpad for a true revival. The game&#39;s creative lead, Chris Auty, characterized the re-do as a &quot;solid base&quot; for the future of the franchise. Even if you don&#39;t like the thought of a rehash, this could lead to true sequels to a series that many had previously written off.</p><div id="8bb840cf73174e718a8f0b58a5f988e2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splinter-cell-remake-ubisoft-191516206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ded3661-be01-4917-a3f2-a65a3a6575c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:15:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639594172</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T18:49:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The entry-level 2022 Polestar 2 will have an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p><p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-epa-270-miles-range-190006554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7480b5a5-358b-4663-9be9-17b1ae6d03fd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639596817</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T19:33:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Paul Barshon / Beadyeye]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Polestar 2 EV parked on a rocky road with stone and dirt cliffs in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘OlliOlli World’ arrives on February 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-indie-game-showcase-how-to-watch-155651019.html"><ins>Indie World Showcase</ins></a> stream has wrapped up, and while there was unfortunately no word about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-hollow-knight-silksong-switch-hands-on.html"><em><ins>Hollow Knight: Silksong</ins></em></a>, Nintendo has revealed more details about other games that are coming to Switch.

The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online.</p><p>In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We&#39;re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases.</p><p>It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-533-million-user-personal-data-leak-180156777.html"><ins>500 million</ins></a> Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online. In some cases, the company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-lawsuit-instagram-profile-scraping-220032564.html"><ins>also</ins></a><a href="http://v/"><ins>sued</ins></a> individuals for data scraping.</p><p>Under the new bug bounty program, researchers will be rewarded for finding “unprotected or openly public databases containing at least 100,000 unique Facebook user records with PII [personally identifiable information] or sensitive data (e.g. email, phone number, physical address, religious or political affiliation).” Instead of its usual payouts though, Meta says it will donate to a charity chosen by the researcher in order not to incentivize the publishing of scraped data.</p><p>For reports of bugs that can lead to data scraping, researchers can choose between a donation or a direct payout. Meta says each bug or dataset is eligible for at least a $500 award.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-expands-bug-bounty-program-to-reward-reports-of-data-scraping-170026342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f992d920-79ae-4896-8725-dae744ccc3e0</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639587226</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T16:53:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/960ff330-0089-11ec-badf-cbbfafa66dbc" width="3543" height="2657" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/960ff330-0089-11ec-badf-cbbfafa66dbc" width="3543" height="2657" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook logo displayed on a phone screen is seen with binary code displayed on a laptop screen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 17, 2021.

The studio, which was founded this year by <em>Threes</em> designer Asher Vollmer, has successfully unionized with CODE-CWA — the Communication Workers of America&#39;s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees.</p><p>Operating out of various locations in the US and Canada, the all-remote team of 13 is an unusual case for a few reasons. Foremost, about half of the bargaining unit are independent contractors – typically the exact sort of workers left out of, or deemed ineligible for, a union.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And while much of the push to unionize digital workspaces in recent years has focused on curbing abuses by management and pay imbalances, Vodeo&#39;s does not appear to stem from a need to course-correct away from imminent disaster. Rather, their desire to unionize seems rooted in wanting to maintain an equitable workplace. “They’re not organizing because there’s some big scary boss, like Bobby Kotick or someone,” campaign lead for CODE-CWA Emma Kinema told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa">Polygon</a>. “They’re organizing because they care so much about the work they do, and they want more of a say over how it’s done — the conditions in which they work to actually make those games that they care about.”</p><p>As Kinema alludes to, the games industry has been going through a period of great internal upheaval. Whistleblowers within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/games-firm-rocksteady-accused-of-lack-of-action-on-harassment">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274969/riot-games-lawsuit-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-ceo">Riot</a>, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/brazil-wildlife-report-harassment/">Wildlife</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/game-workers-unite-quantic-dream-1203207491/">Quantic Dream</a>, have detailed harassment and discrimination. There has also been increased pushback against industry practices such as “crunch,” in which studios demand herculean overtime hours from staff in order to hit targeted release dates. Some Activision-Blizzard workers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/16/activision-blizzard-kotick-walkout/">walked off the job</a>, demanding among other things, the resignation of their CEO, Bobby Kotick. They&#39;ve set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/abk-strike-fund">strike fund</a> and are in the midst of their own union drive.&nbsp;</p><p>“All workers deserve a union and a say in how their workplace is run, no matter where they work, what their employment status is, or what kind of conditions they work under,&quot; Myriame Lachapelle, a producer at Vodeo Games, wrote in a statement to press. &quot;We have been inspired by the growing worker organizing within the gaming industry and hope we can set a new precedent for industry-wide standards that will better our shared working conditions and inspire others to do the same.”</p><p>Vodeo released its first game, the <em>Peggle</em>-like RPG <em>Beast Breaker, </em>in September to largely positive reviews. It&#39;s available for PC, Mac and Switch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-games-union-vodeo-cwa-north-america-165537268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6ad61447-0d23-4acb-acee-adf33ea81e00</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639587707</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:02:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vodeo Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[from the youtube trailer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beast Breaker screengrab]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SiriusXM sued over lack of podcast transcripts for the hard of hearing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SiriusXM has been accused of doing too little to make its podcasts accessible. The National Association of the Deaf and Disability Rights Advocates have filed a <a href="https://www.nad.org/2021/12/14/lawsuit-challenges-inaccessibility-of-major-podcast-platforms/">lawsuit</a> against SiriusXM (including its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-24-siriusxm-to-acquire-pandora-for-3-5-billion.html">Pandora</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/siriusxm-acquires-stitcher-podcasts-122816348.html">Stitcher</a> brands) accusing it of excluding the deaf and hard of hearing by failing to provide captions or transcripts for any podcasts. The company has allegedly violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and New York laws by denying equal access to its content.</p><p>The suit demands both damages and an injunction to force SiriusXM to offer podcast transcripts. The company would also have to &quot;affirmatively&quot; advertise the transcript option to deaf and hard of hearing people.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked SiriusXM for comment. The lawsuit notably doesn&#39;t include other heavyweights, although Apple and Spotify already offer at least some form of captioning or transcription. Spotify has promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-automatically-transcribe-podcasts-accessbility-mobile-165029865.html">auto-transcribe all podcasts</a>, for instance. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834002/siriusxm-lawsuit-transcripts-deaf-users-ada-pandora-stitcher-podcast">statement</a> to <em>The Verge, </em>DRA&#39;s Christina Brandt-Young added the organizations couldn&#39;t sue &quot;every bad podcast provider&quot; in a single lawsuit. You may well see more complaints in the future.</p><p>The lawsuit is, effectively, a request for podcasts service operators to rethink accessibility. NAD and DRA want equal access to be a given, not a nice-to-have extra. In theory, the pressure on SiriusXM will prompt better treatment across the wider podcast industry.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/national-association-of-the-deaf-siriusxm-podcast-lawsuit-151509090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bbb0fc96-fe48-497f-85d0-04bd670e31e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:35:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639580450</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T15:01:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf3dc550-5dab-11ec-bb77-e3d5315789dd" width="3984" height="2656" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf3dc550-5dab-11ec-bb77-e3d5315789dd" width="3984" height="2656" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Coppola via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - NOVEMBER 18: Brie Bella (L) and Nikki Bella speak to guest Tyler Cameron as they host SiriusXM Stitcher's The Bellas Podcast at SiriusXM Studios on November 18, 2021 in New York City.

Visit now and you&#39;ll only see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-only-siri-only-plan-ios-15-2-183416178.html">iOS 15.2&#39;s</a> optional nude photo detection in Messages and intervention when people search for child exploitation terms.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain why Apple has pulled the references. We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. This doesn&#39;t necessarily represent a full retreat from CSAM scanning, but it at least suggests a rollout isn&#39;t imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Apple was already scanning iCloud Photos uploads for hashes of known CSAM, the change would have moved those scans to the devices themselves to ostensibly improve privacy. If iCloud Photos was enabled and enough hashes appeared in a local photo library, Apple would decrypt the relevant &quot;safety vouchers&quot; (included with every image) and manually review the pictures for a potential report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That, in turn, could get police involved.</p><p>The CSAM detection feature drew flak from privacy advocates. Apple stressed the existence of multiple safeguards, such as a high threshold for reviews and its reliance on hashes from multiple child safety organizations rather than government. However, there were concerns the company might still produce false positives or expand scanning under pressure from authoritarian regimes. Moreover, the only way to prevent on-device scans was to avoid using iCloud Photos altogether — you had to accept Apple&#39;s new approach or lose a valuable cloud service.</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-features-csam-delay-132534290.html">delayed the rollout</a> indefinitely to &quot;make improvements&quot; following the criticism. However, it&#39;s now clear the company isn&#39;t in a rush to complete those changes, and doesn&#39;t want to set expectations to the contrary. If local CSAM scanning reappears, it might take a long while (Apple expected a return in the &quot;coming months&quot;) or bear only a partial resemblance to the original system.</p><p><strong>Update 12/15 10:55AM ET:</strong> An Apple spokesperson reiterated the company&#39;s statement when announced the delay in September, indicating that its stance hadn&#39;t changed since then.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-csam-mentions-on-website-151958410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86b61e79-629a-4511-935d-ae523ce4187a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:19:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639583766</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T15:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney+ adds SharePlay group viewing for the iPhone and iPad]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You or your kids might now have a good reason to try Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">SharePlay feature</a>. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/VygYak">Disney+</a> has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/disney/id1446075923">released</a> an update that adds SharePlay group viewing to its iPhone, iPad and Apple TV apps, letting up to 32 people watch and chat together.

At a certain limit called the Alfvén critical surface, materials are able to escape those forces and become part of the solar wind, permanently severing their connection to the Sun.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8a35c03da54d499ba90fd6b3521a5a53"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkaLfbuB_6E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Scientists have estimated that the corona is between 10 to 20 solar radii from the Sun&#39;s surface, or around 4.3 to 8.6 million miles. The Parker Solar probe detected the specific magnetic and particle conditions required for the corona at around 18.8 solar radii, or around 8.1 million miles. It passed in and out of the boundary several times, proving that the Alfvén critical surface has spikes and valleys and isn&#39;t shaped like a smooth ball.</p><p>Inside that region, the probe encountered features called pseudostreamers, or massive structures rising above the Sun&#39;s surface visible during solar eclipses. Flying through the objects was like &quot;flying into the eye of the storm&quot; because of the quieter conditions and slowing particles, NASA said.</p><p>It also made observations that may helped scientists figure out where &quot;switchbacks,&quot; or kinks in the solar wind form. It detected bursts of switchbacks as it passed closer to the sun, and scientists were able to trace those back to the visible surface. Specifically, they found that some types of &quot;fast&quot; switchbacks form in the magnetic funnels created between convection cells on the sun&#39;s surface.&nbsp;</p><p>The probe has not only made the closest-ever pass by the sun, it&#39;s traveling at the greatest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-09-nasa-parker-solar-probe-launch.html">speed</a> of any manmade object ever, currently around 430,000 MPH. The next close pass will happen in January 2022, when scientists will try to determine exactly how switchbacks and other solar phenomena form. &quot;Such measurements from the corona will be critical for understanding and forecasting extreme space weather events that can disrupt telecommunications and damage satellites around Earth,&quot; NASA wrote.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/parker-solar-problem-touch-solar-corona-143207085.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4bf9a34e-2dfe-4701-8e78-4460e4ba95ef</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:32:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639578914</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T14:35:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4ddb6af0-5db2-11ec-85ba-d79ea2226664" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4ddb6af0-5db2-11ec-85ba-d79ea2226664" width="1000" height="667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Gribben/Johns Hopkins APL/NASA ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Parker Solar Probe becomes the first spacecraft to touch the Sun's corona]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Parker Solar Probe becomes the first spacecraft to touch the Sun's corona]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Tab A8 adds a faster processor, more RAM and storage options]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the last few years, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#x002019;s" href="https://fave.co/3p891Zf">Samsung’s</a> Tab A line has been one of the few options for those trying to find a budget Android tablet. Early next year, the company will release the Tab A8 in the US. It&#39;s not an exciting update, but it does offer a handful of enhancements over its predecessor. Samsung says the new model features an “expanded” 10.5-inch display with a 16:10 aspect ratio and 1,920 x 1,200 resolution TFT panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Internally, the Tab A8 has an octa-core processor the company claims is 10 percent faster than the CPU on the Snapdragon 662 that came with its predecessor. Samsung will also offer a 4GB variant of the tablet, in addition to a 3GB base model. The faster processor should make the device feel snappier, particularly if you go for the model with more RAM. For photos and videos, the Tab A8 comes with an 8-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel selfie shooter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/361b88e0-5d4a-11ec-bb8f-7759d67ce116" alt="Samsung Tab A8" data-uuid="3480dfca-55f7-3b20-836c-789721f4b35d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>As for storage, the Tab A8 comes with 32GB standard, though you can also configure the tablet with up to 128GB of internal storage, a first for the line. If you need more space, you can add up to 1TB of additional storage through an included MicroSD slot. Powering everything is a 7,040mAh cell. Samsung didn’t share a battery life estimate, but last year we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-review-171525292.html">found the Tab A7</a>, with the same capacity battery, could go 11 hours and 30 minutes in a video rundown test. The Tab A8 supports up to 15W fast charging, but only comes with a slower 7.75W power adapter inside the box. It keeps the headphone jack found on last year&#39;s models and you can expect it to ship with Android 11.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A8 will hit store shelves in the US next month. Samsung will offer the tablet in three colors: Gray, Silver and Pink Gold. The company didn’t share pricing information. For context, the Tab A8’s predecessor started at $230 – though you could frequently find it on sale for less.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tab-a8-annoucement-140008188.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27aba657-daf9-4acf-9b2f-879ddecee8e9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639588250</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42a7f7b0-5d4a-11ec-a7dd-6b57b6ee85e4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42a7f7b0-5d4a-11ec-a7dd-6b57b6ee85e4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Tab A8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Tab A8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei documents reportedly show involvement in China's surveillance efforts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html">Huawei</a> has long denied working with the Chinese government to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html">spy on</a> other countries and China&#39;s own citizens.

You&#39;ve probably read several variations of that sentence by now if you&#39;ve been keeping track of the observatory, seeing as its launch has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">pushed back</a> quite a few times already. In an announcement <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/14/webb-space-telescope-launch-date-update/">posted</a> on the project&#39;s official page, NASA said that the James Webb team is working on a communication issue between the telescope and its Ariane 5 launch vehicle. As such, it will be launched no earlier than December 24th.</p><p>The James Webb project has experienced numerous setbacks since development started in 1996, due to various reasons that include going overbudget and major redesigns. After testing was suspended in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, NASA worked towards an October 18th, 2021 launch. However, after testing by the agency and primary contractor Northrop Grumman, it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">determined</a> that the telescope wouldn&#39;t be ready until November or December this year. NASA previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">announced</a> a December 18th launch date, which was moved back to the 22nd after an unplanned release of a clamp band that secures James Webb to the launch vehicle adapter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">prompted</a> a thorough check to ensure the telescope wasn&#39;t damaged.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If everything goes as planned this time, December 24th is the earliest possible launch date that could be scheduled. The telescope could be heading towards the second Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system later than Christmas Eve — NASA says it will reveal more details about its new target launch schedule on December 17th. When it does reach its destination, James Webb will observe the universe with a keener eye than Hubble, thanks to instruments that will allow it to see objects too old and too distant for the older telescope.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6b319f7-4433-41ef-bc1f-79ebac39a22a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 11:10:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639575026</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T13:30:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/193a6190-5dab-11ec-b7f7-1b5f8efc7acc" width="1280" height="821" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/193a6190-5dab-11ec-b7f7-1b5f8efc7acc" width="1280" height="821" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ESA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (artist's impression)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (artist's impression)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US puts drone maker DJI and seven other Chinese companies on investment blocklist]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US government will place eight Chinese companies including drone manufacturer DJI on an investment blocklist for alleged involvement in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-22-china-xinjiang-surveillance-tech-spread.html">surveillance of Uyghur Muslims</a>, the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fbcf9467-5b7e-4a81-8b40-d829fefa09ae"><em>Financial Times</em></a> has reported.

Having already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-oppo-foldable-phone-prototype.html">shown</a> a foldable prototype a couple of years ago, it was only a matter of time before Oppo, the world&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">fourth</a> largest smartphone brand, would join the scene. After a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-smartphone-find-n-foldable-112030065.html">teaser</a> from earlier, today the Chinese company <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-092134187.html">unveiled</a> the Find N, which features a 5.49-inch external display and unfolds into a 7.1-inch flexible &quot;Serene Display.&quot;</p><p>What&#39;s special about this design is that Oppo went for a landscape aspect ratio — 9:8.4 (1,920 x 1,792), to be exact — for the flexible AMOLED screen, which offers a more practical split-screen usage. A bit like Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">Surface Duo 2</a>, except this is across one single panel. Similarly, the Find N&#39;s external AMOLED screen comes in a more familiar 9:18 aspect ratio (988 x 1,972), as opposed to something like the narrow 9:24.5 on Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Z Fold 3. The shorter body should also make the device more pocketable than its competitors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3a16bb70-5d83-11ec-bfa9-b0a51e7aedd1" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="7d3e3fea-2cdb-349b-95ff-f82df3ae420c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo added that thanks to its special water-drop flexion hinge design, it&#39;s able to widen the angle of the flexible panel&#39;s fold, thus reducing the crease — &quot;up to 80 percent less noticeable compared with other devices,&quot; which is apparently certified by TÜV Rheinland. The same mechanism allows for a no-gap design when folded. As for the flexible screen itself, its 12-layer structure apparently lets it withstand over 200,000 folds — even at temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius or -4 degrees Fahrenheit. Alas, there&#39;s no IP rating for the Find N, but Oppo reassures us that the device has passed the company&#39;s own humidity and splash tests.</p><p>To our surprise, the Find N is powered by Qualcomm&#39;s slightly older <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888</a>, as opposed to the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> or the existing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888 Plus</a>. Oppo explained that this is due to the longer development cycle of this project. To be fair, this 5G chipset is still plentiful, plus the phone also comes with up to 12GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 3.1 storage, along with ColorOS 12 based on Android 11, which should keep things running smoothly on that 120Hz flexible screen (though the external screen is capped at 60Hz).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cd7b1b70-5d8a-11ec-bdff-908be1bbc2e3" alt="Oppo Find N next to an Oppo Reno 7 Pro" data-uuid="8590915e-09b5-30de-b0c7-ed1e6b47bf67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>Other goodies in this 275g device include a 50-megapixel f/1.8 main camera (Sony IMX766 sensor; same as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-x3-pro-cameras-122009466.html">Find X 3 Pro</a>), a 16-megapixel (IMX481) f/2.2 ultra-wide camera plus a 13-megapixel (Samsung S5K3M5) f/2.4 2x telephoto camera on the back, and a 32-megapixel (IMX615) f/2.4 punch hole selfie camera on both the external screen and the inner screen. There&#39;s a 4,500mAh battery which supports 33W SuperVOOC rapid charging and 15W AirVOOC wireless charging; you can also use the phone for 10W reverse charging.</p><p>Unlike many recent flagship Androids, unlocking is done with a side-mounted fingerprint-scanning power button, rather than an under-display fingerprint reader, which makes sense since it&#39;d be a bit ambitious to work that sensor into the large flexible screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3c4d29d0-5d8b-11ec-bfff-107771265ebc" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="eea90a34-a2fb-36e5-b5ed-5e348d40b955"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>On the software side, this version of ColorOS 12 comes with a &quot;FlexForm Mode&quot; which lets you use the Find N in the form of a mini laptop. This applies to use cases like video calls, taking notes, taking 4K time-lapse photos of the sky and more. Likewise, you can use the external screen as a selfie viewfinder, though this is nothing new in the world of foldables.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fb1af280-5d8a-11ec-b6f3-ead654e9c24c" alt="Oppo Find N" data-uuid="e5a060c2-f236-33f6-9dfc-4a888d5e88c1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>My favorite feature here is perhaps the split-screen gesture: simply use two fingers to swipe down the middle of the flexible screen, and you&#39;ll instantly split the screen into two. You can also tap the three dots in the middle of this virtual divider to create a shortcut for the current app combo. If needed, you can also use four fingers to pinch the large screen to turn the current app into a floating window.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, there&#39;s a &quot;seamless relay&quot; feature which lets you easily go from the large screen to the smaller external screen. As soon as you fold the Find N, the external screen will offer a five-second window to let you swipe up and activate it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2eef1b80-5d7d-11ec-af76-26e57fd8348c" alt="Oppo Find N &#x0052d5;&#x00624b;&#x0073a9;" data-uuid="2a76398b-24a3-344c-90d0-56377ead82ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese</div></figure><p>The Find N comes in black, white and purple, with the purple offering being exclusive to its higher-end model. In China, this new phone is immediately available for <a href="https://www.oppo.com/cn/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n/">pre-ordering</a> ahead of its December 23rd launch, with the base model (8GB RAM and 256GB storage) asking for 7,699 yuan (about $1,210), and the higher-end model (12GB RAM and 512GB storage) going for 8,999 yuan (around $1,410). That&#39;s surprisingly affordable — even more so than Xiaomi&#39;s Mix Fold.&nbsp;</p><p>Sadly, Oppo doesn&#39;t plan on bringing its first-ever foldable to outside of China just yet, but our review unit did just land on my doorstep a few hours ago. I&#39;ll be spending the next few days figuring out whether this device lives up to its hype (and whether I can even run Google services on it), so stay tuned for our further impressions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01adf24f-9584-43f5-9ed9-1cb7ae1d103b</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 10:12:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639563273</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T10:14:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2f120cd0-5d7d-11ec-b8db-dcf4f76acf66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2f120cd0-5d7d-11ec-b8db-dcf4f76acf66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sanji Feng / Engadget Chinese]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo Find N 動手玩]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo Find N 動手玩]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polk Audio reveals its first Dolby Atmos soundbar]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/polk%20audio">Polk Audio</a> has unveiled its first Dolby Atmos soundbar.

And according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/14/google-employees-to-lose-pay-if-dont-comply-with-vaccination-policy.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, if they failed to comply with the tech giant&#39;s vaccine mandate, they&#39;d have to apply for a medical or religious exemption and convince Google that it&#39;s warranted if they don&#39;t want to eventually lose their job. Google will approve exemptions on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>In its report, the publication said that it has seen an internal memo warning personnel of the consequences if they still haven&#39;t complied with the company&#39;s vaccine rules by January 18th. Those who refuse to be vaccinated or who have failed to secure a valid exemption will be placed on paid administrative leave for 30 days. Google will then put them on unpaid personal leave for up to six months and will ultimately fire them if they truly don&#39;t want to be inoculated against COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech giant reportedly explained in the memo that it&#39;s implementing its vaccine mandate to comply with the administration&#39;s executive order. Under that order, all US companies with more than 100 workers must be fully vaccinated by January 18th. While the order is in limbo after courts had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/12/06/1061771112/new-york-city-covid-vaccine-mandate-workers-omicron">blocked</a> its implementation, Google may have simply chosen to push through with its plans to ensure that it&#39;s compliant in case the order suddenly takes effect.</p><p>&quot;We expect that almost all roles at Google in the US will fall within the scope of the executive order. Anyone entering a Google building must be fully vaccinated or have an approved accommodation that allows them to work or come onsite... frequent testing is not a valid alternative to vaccination,&quot; the memo reportedly reads.</p><p>Earlier this month, <em>CNBC</em> also reported that Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-delays-workers-return-to-office-055953394.html">delayed</a> workers&#39; return to office and will no longer require personnel to come in a few times a week starting on January 10th. However, it still encouraged employees to come into the office &quot;where conditions allow, to reconnect with colleagues in person and start regaining the muscle memory of being in [one] more regularly.&quot;</p><p>While it will strictly enforce its rule for all employees that fall within the scope of the order, Google did give those who don&#39;t want to get vaccinated an option. If they can&#39;t secure a valid religious or medical exemption, they can &quot;explore&quot; other roles within the company that don&#39;t conflict with the order. If they can find such a role and it doesn&#39;t require in-office work, they can also permanently work remotely going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-employees-vaccine-rules-fired-071252020.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">13c9c997-7068-43b8-afd1-dc18bf045e26</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 07:12:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639583789</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T15:56:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6ad9e970-fb55-11eb-9f7f-499a41bec554" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6ad9e970-fb55-11eb-9f7f-499a41bec554" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Prostock-Studio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vaccination of patients in hospital against covid-19 pandemic.

Previously, the company teased us with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ufo-portable-gaming-pc.html">a Switch-like PC gaming console</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ori-duet-foldable-dual-screen-pc-hands-on-2020.html">pair of dual-screen and foldable computers</a>. This time around, Dell is showing off a few prototypes around &quot;seamless work experiences&quot; called Concept Flow, Concept Stanza and Concept Pari. I checked them out at a recent demo in New York (while abiding by COVID-19 protocols), and was surprised by how refined they are.</p><p>Of the three, Pari is my favorite. It&#39;s a wireless camera prototype that can magnetically attach to a compatible screen so you can place it at eye level while Zooming your colleagues. Not only does this help keep a more natural gaze as you&#39;re talking, but it also allows you to keep your notes or script up behind the camera in a sort of teleprompter setup. The magnets won&#39;t work with just any standard monitor, though; you&#39;ll need to use one with magnets built in too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I appreciate the elegance of Dell&#39;s approach. The webcam sits in a cradle perched atop the monitor, and you remove it when you want a different angle. When it&#39;s docked, the webcam wirelessly charges (and a light is supposed to glow to indicate it&#39;s juicing up, though this wasn&#39;t happening during our demo). You can also flip the camera around to face the back of the dock when you want some privacy, so if anyone is spying on you, they&#39;ll only see the black cover.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="84305c2a-d5cb-404e-bd5c-250ebcc886ba"/><p>During my brief time with the prototype, I was able to easily pick up the webcam and attach it to the monitor. The magnets were strong enough to keep the camera in place and prevent it from sliding, yet not so strong that I had to struggle to take it off. I especially liked the stand that Dell made for Pari, which turns it into an overhead camera for top-down shots. It was convenient to pluck the camera off the screen and stick it to the magnetic disc on the stand, which looked like a thin, modern light. The version that I checked out at our demo felt slightly flimsy and I wish the disc swiveled on a hinge to offer more flexibility in angles, but given this is just a concept, I will withhold my complaints for now.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Pari is a prototype at the moment, Dell has some specs to share. The device weighs about an ounce (30 grams) and this iteration has an onboard microphone. It streams 1080p video over WiFi and has a light above the lens up front to indicate when the camera is level, so you can more easily ensure your scene is straight. The cradle uses USB-C for charging, too. Since this isn&#39;t currently something the company is ready to sell, it doesn&#39;t have details on battery life, much less a possible price.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b01ddbe0-5c62-11ec-b9b7-9aa02e74d567" alt="A barrel-shaped webcam sitting on a cradle on top of a monitor, with a hand reaching out to grab it. The camera is facing backwards." data-uuid="0e1d53fe-45a5-3dda-b5da-f74b513161f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Dell&#39;s two other concepts were more about multi-device environments. Flow, for example, uses a dock to link all the devices at your home office, like a monitor, keyboard, mouse and charger. Then, it lets your laptop wirelessly connect to them while also charging it. If you bring the laptop out of Bluetooth range, the external monitor locks and reconnects when you return with your computer. According to Dell, Flow is the result of bringing together &quot;devices, industry standard wireless charging technology, intelligent software applications and Wi-Fi 6E docking technology to create a singular, seamless experience.&quot;</p><p>Finally, Stanza centers around an 11-inch &quot;companion device&quot; that&#39;s basically a thin and light tablet without ports. Dell said it &quot;deliberately chose not to include cameras or speakers, for a distraction-free experience.&quot; You can write on it with a stylus and double tap to have your scribbles converted to digital text. As with many other note-taking apps, you can also draw a line through words to delete them. If you&#39;re drawing a Venn diagram, Dell&#39;s system can also convert your imperfect circles with squiggly lines into flawless spheres. The tablet can also serve as an additional screen onto which you can extend or mirror whatever&#39;s on your laptop screen.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f319b490-5cef-11ec-bf97-c3619550b0c3" alt="Dell&#39;s Concept Stanza tablet-like device docked on a table with a stylus magnetically attached to its top edge. Also visible is the corner of a bigger monitor on the table." data-uuid="ff6038b2-b6c7-39ca-9c1e-7b9a86b46a6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Again, since these are all just concepts, Dell doesn&#39;t have pricing or availability info to share, but it&#39;s possible we&#39;ll see aspects of these designs show up in the future products. Additionally, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-project-luna-pc-easier-to-repair-and-recycle-160056898.html">showed off another Concept yesterday called Luna</a>, and it&#39;s a way to make PCs more sustainable by making their parts easier to replace. Dell is clearly exploring how to make products that align with industry trends (like hybrid workforce, sustainability), and we&#39;ll hopefully see some of the benefits of these in its actual products soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dell-ces-2022-concept-pari-flow-stanza-hands-on-050112791.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb7104e4-5773-46de-bc8e-da18bc7a74ed</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 05:01:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639521108</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T22:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68f7e670-5c62-11ec-bb6d-460131f369dc" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68f7e670-5c62-11ec-bb6d-460131f369dc" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of people on a video call on a screen with a webcam sitting on the monitor's face.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell's Concept Pari webcam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter adds automatically generated captions for videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is taking another step toward becoming more accessible.

In separate complaints filed on Tuesday with the Superior Court in Alameda County, the women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, physical contact and discrimination while at work.</p><p>Jessica Brooks, one of the women who sued Tesla, alleges she was harassed on her first day of orientation at the automaker. She claims a supervisor told his male subordinates to “check out the new girl.” Brooks says the harassment was so constant she eventually stacked boxes around her workstation to deter her coworkers from whistling at her. Brooks also claims she complained of the situation to Tesla’s HR department. The company allegedly responded by moving Brooks to a different part of the factory instead of addressing the situation directly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,” Brooks <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/">told <em>The Washington </em>Post</a>. “That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job.”</p><p>When Jessica Barraza sued Tesla last month, she said she was subjected to “nightmarish” working conditions at the company’s Fremont plant. Barraza’s lawsuit described a factory floor that looked more like “a crude, archaic construction site or frat house” than the site of one of the most advanced EV makers in the country. Most of the seven women who have sued Tesla have linked the abuse they experienced to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. “He would make 69 or 420 jokes … which caused the technicians to be even worse,” said one of the complaints.</p><p>The suit comes on the same day five former SpaceX employees accused Musk’s other company of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sexual-harassment-claims-204712046.html">doing little to stop sexual harassment</a>. We’ve reached out to Tesla for comment. The automaker does not operate a public relations department. When a federal court recently ordered Tesla to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">pay $137 million</a> to a Black worker who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at the company’s Fremont factory, the company said: “We continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns. Occasionally, we’ll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-factory-sexual-harassment-complaints-212738930.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09ed2017-eb3a-412b-9c26-b6b257080054</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 21:27:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639519468</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T22:04:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7f78db0-5d22-11ec-97ac-b92d69ccbeb7" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7f78db0-5d22-11ec-97ac-b92d69ccbeb7" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[FREMONT, CALIFORNIA - MAY 12: An aerial view of the Tesla Fremont Factory on May 12, 2020 in Fremont, California.

Women who previously worked at SpaceX, including mission engineer <a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/at-spacex-we-re-told-we-can-change-the-world-just-don-t-try-to-stop-the-sexual-harassment">Ashley Kosak</a> and four others speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831380/spacex-employees-harassment-workplace-misconduct-elon-musk"><em>The Verge</em></a>, have accused the company of doing little to stop sexual harassment. Male staff reportedly made numerous unwanted advances, lewd comments and physical contact. Kosak claimed one coworker went so far as to visit her house and insist on touching her, while former intern Julia CrowleyFarenga (who sued SpaceX in 2020) said a male employee blocked her from getting hired after she reported his controlling behavior.</p><p>SpaceX was allegedly reluctant to take significant action. While the women did report incidents to SpaceX&#39;s human resources, the company appeared to be more interested in keeping the company&#39;s plans on track than on dealing with harassment. HR asked Kosak to propose solutions to sexual harassment, but there was no follow-up — and both HR lead Brian Bjelde as well as company president Gwynne Shotwell were apparently unaware of her allegations when she met them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked SpaceX for comment. In an email <em>The Verge</em> obtained, however, Shotwell was aware of Kosak&#39;s web essay on the matter and said HR would conduct both in-house and independent audits of its practices. She also reiterated SpaceX&#39;s &quot;no A-hole&quot; policy and that targets of harassment should still report incidents to HR or managers. Shotwell didn&#39;t touch on concerns of retaliation, though, and the news came just as six more Tesla workers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/14/tesla-sexual-harassment/">sued</a> over sexual harassment claims.</p><p>All of the affected women pinned the problems on a leadership and company culture that prioritized the mission over workers&#39; wellbeing. Elon Musk sees engineers as a &quot;resource to be mined,&quot; Kosak said, rather than people to be cared for. Throw in an overwhelmingly male workforce that leaves women isolated (one complainant likened it to a &quot;boys&#39; club&quot;) and women may have little chance of meaningfully addressing harassment. If that&#39;s the case, any long-term solutions may require management and policy changes, not just better enforcement of the policies that exist.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sexual-harassment-claims-204712046.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5eabfa38-b2b4-42e3-befc-d2ca7b3d9ae5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 20:47:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639519480</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T22:04:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0a47d20-5d15-11ec-bfe5-e33a297c60ee" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0a47d20-5d15-11ec-bfe5-e33a297c60ee" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX, Flickr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew-3 mission at the launchpad]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew-3 mission at the launchpad]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
