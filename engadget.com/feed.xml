Parents, relatives and grandparents can connect to the device through the accompanying Glow mobile app, allowing them to interact with the projected playspace remotely. The side of the device features a physical privacy toggle that disables Glow&#39;s microphone and camera.

The Amazon-owned security company has teamed up with Eero, the Amazon-owned networking firm, to incorporate the latter’s tech in the former’s hardware. With the Alarm Pro including an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-eero-6-mesh-wifi-router-173331388.html">Eero router inside</a>, the one module can now sit at the heart of your home’s internet and security system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/92aa8150-1d36-11ec-ba7f-e1299e9a8917" alt="Ring Alarm Pro Hardware Image" data-uuid="90e291d5-3086-3662-a140-4e1e506daff3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>In addition, Ring will now sell you additional battery packs which can be used to extend the working life of your Alarm system during power outages up to 24 hours. It’s worth saying that you can’t simply shove an Eero router next to your existing Ring Alarm product, however, since many of the new features take advantage of the integrations available to the Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a51b9310-1d36-11ec-9efd-5890289565f9" alt="Image of the Ring Alarm Pro Battery Pack" data-uuid="9c325cf3-8359-3b86-912e-d570af923fc1"><figcaption>You will need to buy four packs to get your base station&#39;s battery life to 24 hours.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>To take advantage of the technology, you’ll need to sign up to Ring’s new subscription product, dubbed Protect Pro. The package offers cloud video storage, professional monitoring, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18021383011">Alexa Guard Plus</a>, 24/7 backup internet for your security devices (via an LTE module in the Ring Pro base station) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-eero-secure-subscriptions-router.html">Eero’s cybersecurity subscription product</a> for network protection. This, at least in the US as it launches, will set you back $20 a month, or $200 per year per location up front.</p><p>Ring COO Mike Harris said that the decision to work with Eero was not one foisted down from upon high by Amazon. Instead, Harris said that both companies saw the opportunity to work together to help leverage their individual skills in tandem.</p><p>At the same time, Ring is launching a system dubbed “Virtual Security Guard,” which connects users to third-party security guards. You’ll need to pay for that separately, but you can hand over access to select Ring camera feeds to those companies who can keep a watch over your property. It is only when motion is detected that an operator can access your feed, and can speak to whoever is there to determine their intentions. Ring adds that third parties can’t view motion events when the camera is disarmed, and can’t download, share or save the clips of what’s going on in your front yard. The first company to sign up for the program is Rapid Response, with others expected to join in the near future.</p><p>Ring also offered up some good news for existing Ring doorbell owners, at least if you’re rocking the Pro 2 or the 2020-and-newer version of the standard bell. Those devices will soon be able to take advantage of smart alerts that will let you know if a package was delivered to a specially-designated zone on your doorstep. In addition, you can set up your Spotlight Cam Battery to identify an object left in a specific state, such as if you’ve left your garage door open. This should be useful, again, to avoid the curse of the “did I leave X unlocked” when you’re miles away from home.</p><p>The Ring Alarm Pro is available to pre-order today for $250, with the Protect Pro package costing you $20 a month. If you want to try Virtual Security Guard, meanwhile, you will need to contact the company and apply for early access</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">873c172b-31a8-4e75-8512-5d5c24440d41</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:43:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632847424</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:43:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ring]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Device family image of the Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon made Disney a 'Hey, Disney!' voice assistant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Disney has just announced a new voice assistant called &quot;Hey, Disney!&quot;.

In addition, it may help assuage those universal fears about leaving your oven on, a window open or the back door unlocked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it was launched, Ring sought to address the privacy concerns that some would-be users may have about the drone’s technology. For instance, the drone’s camera is obscured by its base station when it’s not in flight, and will issue an audible warning when it’s recording. The fortunate users who are allowed to sign up to try one of these out will be charged $250, but it&#39;s not clear if you&#39;ll get any sort of perk for the privilege of beta-testing the hardware.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a297bef5-1832-4783-88c4-3b51fad79cd1</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:39:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632847777</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:49:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5607dcb0-1f85-11ec-8968-8b9af9580b1a" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5607dcb0-1f85-11ec-8968-8b9af9580b1a" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ring]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Ring's Always Home Cam]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ring Always Home Cam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon unveils $80 Halo View fitness band to take on Fitbit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is expanding its wearables portfolio, after introducing the screenless <a href="https://newsprime.xyz/amazons-halo-app-gets-better-with-movement-health-update-engadget/">Halo fitness band</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-platform-134146361.html">last year</a>.

Today, at its annual fall event, the company announced the Echo Show 15, its largest one to-date. With a 15.6-inch 1080p display, the Echo Show 15 almost looks like a large picture frame. It can be wall-mounted or placed on a stand, in either portrait or landscape orientation. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 15 will retail for $249.99" href="https://amzn.to/39MOySC">Echo Show 15 will retail for $249.99</a>.</p><p>Since it has such a large display, Amazon has introduced a redesigned home screen to go along with the Echo Show 15. You can configure it so that part of the screen has the usual rotating array of ambient content like headlines and weather updates (those who already have an Echo Show will be familiar with this), while the rest of it can be customized with various Alexa widgets. Think of the whole thing as a multifunctional family bulletin board.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those widgets include useful applications like a family calendar, a shared shopping list, sticky notes, to-do lists, reminders, recipe recommendations from sources like Allrecipes and Epicurious, restaurant delivery options and more. There’s a Blue Apron widget that helps you order meal kits and shows you step-by-step recipe instructions. A connected home widget helps you view and control your favorite smart home devices. You can also enable picture-in-picture live camera viewing so you can keep an eye on your kids while you’re cooking dinner. There’s also a widget to help you track package deliveries.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61b9f730-202c-11ec-af7b-aaf814de2d79" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="d7b2a9e2-8a20-345e-ac6d-287755815933"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>According to Amazon, these Alexa widgets will also be available on the other Echo Shows, but you’ll have to swipe the screen to see them. On the Echo Show 15, however, they can be arranged to appear on the home screen, which can’t be done on smaller-screened Echo Shows. In the event you have guests over and don’t want them to see all of your calendars and personal information, you can enable a picture frame mode on the Echo Show 15 so that it only shows photos or art work.</p><p>Additionally, the Echo Show 15 has a new visual ID feature that’s able to recognize your face, which will prompt it to show you personalized information such as your calendar appointments, reminders and notes. This is potentially useful in a multi-person household, as you can show sticky notes meant only for specific members of the family, for example. Additionally, if you enroll your child in visual ID, the device will show them age-appropriate content.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/909de700-202c-11ec-bfac-4e9fc023f898" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="ca255ef6-bd34-3bc1-b5ee-c9e0420b639e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>For those who have privacy concerns, visual ID is entirely optional, plus all of the computer vision information remains on the device, with nothing going to the cloud. The microphone and camera have power toggles, and there’s a built-in camera shutter. Plus, you can always view and delete your voice recordings.</p><p>Much like the other Alexa-powered smart displays, the Echo Show 15 has a bevy of entertainment options that include Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and more. All Echo Shows will soon support TikTok and Sling TV streaming as well.</p><p>The Echo Show 15 is powered by Amazon’s AZ2 Neural Edge processor, which powers a lot of the device’s on-board machine learning and computer vision capabilities. It enables the aforementioned visual ID feature, and it also lets you teach Alexa your personal preferences. For example, you can tell Alexa you’re a vegetarian, and the next time you ask Alexa for recipes, it’ll remember that and only show you vegetarian recipes.</p><p>One particularly intriguing new feature is that you can also teach Alexa to recognize sounds. So for example, if your refrigerator beeps when it’s open for too long, you can teach Alexa to recognize that sound, and then notify you that you need to close your fridge door. You can teach it to recognize the doorbell, the microwave ding, the washing machine tune and various other household alerts. This sounds potentially very helpful, especially for those who are hard of hearing.</p><p>Amazon says that the Echo Show 15 will be available later this year. Countertop stands and under-cabinet mount accessories will be sold separately at a yet-to-be-determined price.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afc53d62-db54-4569-aaf3-3e5c45024b5b</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:17:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632845883</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:18:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ca9333d0-202b-11ec-bff3-fa85496c17c4" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ca9333d0-202b-11ec-bff3-fa85496c17c4" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe adds AI-powered masking tools to Lightroom]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobe"><ins>Adobe</ins></a> has <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/09/28/from-the-acr-team-masking-reimagined.html"><ins>revealed</ins></a> some new masking upgrades that are coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lightroom"><ins>Lightroom</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Lightroom%20Classic"><ins>Lightroom Classic</ins></a> and Adobe Camera Raw (or ACR, Photoshop&#39;s raw photo processing tool). The company calls it the &quot;biggest change to providing control over selectively enhancing photos&quot; since it released Lightroom 2 in 2008.</p><p>The Adobe Research team wanted to bring AI-powered selection tools such as Select Subject and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/photoshop-desktop-ipad-update-artificial-intelligence-130024695.html"><ins>Sky Replacement</ins></a> from Photoshop into Lightroom and ACR, but the image processing engine used in the latter two was incompatible. The team had to make some big changes under the hood, which gave it a chance to change how selections are handled in Lightroom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="32c1ef7f58ec4127a587ef7bc4bc96d8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLVaLkFPPEA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Until now, ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic have only supported vector-based selections (which are recorded as mathematical expressions), but the AI-powered masks need bitmap (or image-based) support. So, to bring the AI-based tools to those apps, Adobe had to make both approaches work together. It&#39;s still able to use vector-based selections for brush, gradients, and range masks to minimize the storage space needed, while the select subject and select sky tools (which can create a mask for a subject or sky with a single click) use bitmaps.</p><p>As it figured out how to make those two kinds of selections work together, Adobe developed new features for ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic across desktops, mobile devices, tablets and the web. One such upgrade is mask groups, which will let you combine any mask tools. For instance, you&#39;ll be able to use a gradient vector-based tool in concert with an AI-powered feature such as select sky. It&#39;ll be possible to separate a mask from another masking tool as well. You&#39;ll be able to invert selections and there&#39;ll be more options for range masks, such as targeting the entire image.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6f8afcb0-2068-11ec-93f9-af436eca08ec" style="height:968;width:968;" alt="Mask features in Adobe Lightroom" data-uuid="f1a9591b-9672-36c2-bcb5-5f9658b7c2ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>A new masking panel should help you keep these masks organized. If you&#39;re using one of the desktop apps, you can move the panel around. In addition, you can name each mask to help keep track of what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;ll be able to preview masks in a variety of different ways with the help of overlay visualizations Adobe brought over from Photoshop.</p><p>Elsewhere, Adobe wanted to ensure the tools were available across apps and devices. It says the AI-powered tools work just as well on mobile devices as they do on desktop, while it&#39;s bringing range masks from ACR and Lightroom Classic to Lightroom&#39;s desktop and mobile apps. The company&#39;s also promising better in-app support to help you get the most out of all these tools, such as a step-by-step tutorial in Lightroom.</p><p>The feature parity means that no matter which device or app you prefer for image editing, you should have access to the same tools. These masking upgrades will be available in ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic starting on October 26th. Adobe says its Research and Design Research teams are working on more AI-powered tools and other improvements it plans to announce in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-camera-raw-lightroom-classic-mask-features-ai-160056644.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49b39819-5d37-41e1-8cc9-6cce127f788a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632840280</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T14:44:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bcedf10-2068-11ec-afd7-f6730c12cb32" width="1507" height="1004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bcedf10-2068-11ec-afd7-f6730c12cb32" width="1507" height="1004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mask features in Adobe Lightroom]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mask features in Adobe Lightroom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's 'New World' MMORPG is finally here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-mmo-delay-september-28-203855352.html">delays</a> spanning nearly a year and a half of missed release dates, <em>New World</em> is finally here.

The two have <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/sep/news-4075850.html">revealed</a> a prototype self-driving semi truck meant for &quot;long-haul&quot; trips in North America, not just quick hops as with past vehicles. The variant of Volvo&#39;s VNL looks familiar, but packs a wide array of sensors to detect the surrounding environment and navigate on its own using the virtual Aurora Driver.</p><p>The automaker was shy on technical details, but said the big rig expanded on existing VNL safety features like Volvo Dynamic Steering and automated transmission to create a &quot;redundant&quot; system. This truck might not run into much trouble on the highway, in other words. The companies previously said they hoped for Level 4 autonomy, or completely human-free driving in limited situations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Volvo has already put autonomous trucks into service in countries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-26-volvo-self-driving-truck-mine-hauling.html">like Norway</a> and its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-14-volvo-trucks-autonomous-truck-vera-sweden.html">Swedish homeland</a>. However, they&#39;ve generally been limited to short, narrowly defined routes. In theory, the new prototype could handle the longer distances and varied conditions necessary to shuttle payloads between North American cities.</p><p>Volvo didn&#39;t say when it expected the prototype to reach public roads, let alone when you might see a production truck. The company would also need regulations allowing commercial self-driving trucks, not just the testing you see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-new-york-joins-list-of-self-driving-autonomous-car-testbeds.html">in some states</a>.

Today, the Panasonic-owned brand is debuting the EAH-AZ60 and EAH-AZ40 with similar designs and spec sheets. The key difference being the pricier AZ60 offers active noise cancellation (ANC) while the AZ40 doesn&#39;t. Where the AZ70W was more audio focused, Technics says the two new options are designed for productivity and everyday life.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to ANC, the AZ60 also supports LDAC: Sony&#39;s wireless audio standard that offers higher quality sound over regular Bluetooth (AAC). Inside, the AZ60 has slightly larger drivers — 8mm vs. 6mm — which is likely part of the reason they&#39;re two grams heavier. Besides those items, Technics&#39; new models share a lot of similarities. The overall aesthetic is nearly identical, right down to the IPX4 construction. Both options employ JustMyVoice tech, which Technics says provides &quot;crystal clear&quot; calls by detecting your voice and reducing background noise. The company explains the AZ60 has four mics on each earbud to help with this, while the AZ40 has three on each side. Bluetooth multi-point connectivity means you can switch between your phone and your laptop with ease between calls.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/69f4d370-205e-11ec-bbdf-3d63dd88baa8" alt="Technics EAH-AZ40" data-uuid="df96146f-c4c9-3bd0-8643-f948f2f71794"><figcaption>Technics EAH-AZ40</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Technics</div></figure><p>The AZ60 and AZ40 are equipped with additional sound modes to suit different listening environments. The Natural Ambient mode allows you to listen to &quot;all surrounding noise&quot; while the Attention mode is configured to capture the frequency range of voices. In theory, this should primarily pick up a chatty co-worker or airport announcements, but without testing we can&#39;t say for certain how well this works.&nbsp;</p><p>Battery life varies a bit between the two models due to ANC and LDAC support on the AZ60. That set of earbuds will last up to four and half hours with noise cancelling and LDAC. Opt for lower-res streaming and you can increase battery life by 2.5 hours. Technics says disabling ANC in either scenario will give you an additional 30 minutes of listening time. When you factor in the case, the AZ60 can go for up to 25 hours with ANC and LDAC both disabled when you really need to stretch things. The AZ40, on the other hand, will last up to seven and a half hours with 25 total hours when you factor in the case. Those are the same figures as the AZ60 with noise cancellation and LDAC off. Both models have a quick-charge feature that will give you between 45 and 90 minutes of use in 15 minutes, depending on your sound settings.</p><p>The EAH-AZ60 and EAH-AZ40 will be available in October for $199.99 and $129.99 respectively. The AZ60 will only be available in black and silver, but the AZ40 will come in a rose gold option in addition to those two hues. Both models clock in less than the AZ70W, which was $250 when it debuted last year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 10:29AM ET: </strong>This post has been updated with additional information from Technics&#39; livestreamed press event.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-az60-and-eah-az40-true-wireless-earbuds-140003867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d02c5827-0c46-46e0-82ab-d333b0075699</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632839411</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T14:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b4cdbd0-2057-11ec-b3ff-38c52222d3c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b4cdbd0-2057-11ec-b3ff-38c52222d3c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Technics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Technics EAH-AZ60]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Technics EAH-AZ60]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yamaha's latest true wireless earbuds are its smallest yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yamaha may not be one of the first names that comes to mind when discussing earbuds or headphones. But the company has a number of models under its belt, ranging from affordable to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-anc-headphones-130036800.html">premium and pricey</a>. Following its <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3a/index.html">TW-E3A</a> true wireless earbuds, Yamaha has announced <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3b/index.html">the TW-E3B</a>: a set that it describes as its smallest and lightest option yet.&nbsp;</p><p>While that may be true, based on the product images, the TW-E3B still has considerable size compared to the truly tiny options like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Jabra&#39;s Elite 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Buds 2</a>. Nevertheless, they&#39;re 25 percent smaller than the TW-E3A, which is an improvement. Besides the size, debossed logos and charging indicator lights on the case, the overall look of the new model is quite similar to that of it&#39;s predecessor. There are more color options available on the E3B, but overall, Yamaha didn&#39;t opt for a complete redesign here.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0ea73150-200b-11ec-bbfa-d2d2f7455ba7" alt="Yamaha TW-E3B" data-uuid="d6dc6a62-9c3e-3925-9306-c0b5dae569b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yamaha</div></figure><p>Battery life is the same: six hours on the buds with three additional charges in the case for 24 hours total. The new version is still IPX5 rated for water and sweat resistance while on-board controls return to assist with audio playback, calls and activating your chosen voice assistant. Yamaha brought back Listening Care, a feature that the company says will still give you &quot;full-range sound&quot; at lower volumes to help preserve your hearing. Like the TW-E3A, the TW-E3B works with Yamaha&#39;s app for Android and iOS that gives you a degree of customization for certain settings.&nbsp;</p><p>The TW-E3B will be available in late October for $99.95 — $30 less than the TW-E3A&#39;s debut price. When it arrives, you&#39;ll be able to choose from black, grey, green, blue, pink and purple color options. The TW-E3A is still available at a discount, <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3a/index.html">going for $49.95</a>.

The furniture giant will sell the new model&#39;s lamp base and shade separately, allowing you to mix and match parts to ensure the final product fits the vibe of your home. You can choose between a black or a white lamp base, which the companies had designed to be slightly smaller than its predecessor. Stjepan Begic, product owner at IKEA of Sweden, said they decided to make make the base smaller after finding out that a lot of people use the Symfonisk lamp on their nightstand.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also choose between two types of shades: textile or glass. Both are available in black and white, as well. In addition, this model supports a wider range of bulbs thanks to its added E26/E27 socket, whereas the previous generation only fits E12 (E14 in the UK) bulbs. When it comes to the speaker itself, Sara Morris, Principal Product Manager at Sonos, said it provides a &quot;wider and more room-filling sound.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companies launched the first Symfonisk products back in 2019, giving you the chance to purchase  Sonos-level quality speakers without the Sonos-level price. These new lamps are priced similarly to the previously generation, which originally sold for $179. The base, which houses the WiFi-connected speaker itself, will set you back $152, confirming previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-sonos-speaker-lamp-swappable-shade-symfonisk-picture-frame-194040016.html">reports</a> about the then-unannounced product.

The main device is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:64GB, 2019 Fire HD 10" href="https://amzn.to/2WoMLQQ">64GB, 2019 Fire HD 10</a>, which is nearly half off at $96. That&#39;s even better than its Prime Day price of $100 that we saw back in June, and considering the 2021 version of the tablet isn&#39;t too different, this is a good way to get one of the most capable Fire tablets for less.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2WoMLQQ" id="7e3062dc414b4cdbac8d4b674161e91e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 2019 Fire HD 10 (64GB) at Amazon - $96</a><p>The 2019 model and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:latest Fire HD 10" href="https://amzn.to/2XOLD9n">latest Fire HD 10</a> have a lot in common: both have 10.1-inch 1080p touchscreens, although the new version&#39;s is 10 percent brighter, and both run on 2.0GHz octa-core processors. The max amount of built-in storage you can get on either is 64GB, but both can be expanded with a microSD card slot. The 2019 version can hold up to 512GB of storage while the new model has a 1TB capacity. Both also have a 12-hour estimated battery life and both charge via USB-C.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Arguably the biggest differences between the two are in design and RAM. The 2021 model has a slightly more refined design with thinner bezels, and it comes in new colors as well as configurations like the &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Productivity bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3kNalAb">Productivity bundle</a>,&quot; which includes one year of Microsoft 365 and a keyboard case. Also, the previous version had 2GB of RAM while the new model has 3GB.&nbsp;</p><p>The increased RAM will likely make the biggest difference in the overall experience of the new Fire HD 10 compared to its predecessor. But if you&#39;re willing to skip that extra gigabyte of memory and the other small upgrades, the 2019 Fire HD 10 remains a solid budget tablet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2019-fire-hd-10-tablet-daily-deal-closeout-sale-125310342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08c4a820-c70f-4b95-b267-efeec8c1d11d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:53:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632833593</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T12:53:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/928c5e30-0a56-11eb-8458-6931e194f994" width="1600" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/928c5e30-0a56-11eb-8458-6931e194f994" width="1600" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s 2019 Fire HD 10 tablet drops to a new low of $96]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox Series X/S consoles now support Dolby Vision for gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been quite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-dolby-atmos-vision-120027655.html"><ins>a long time coming</ins></a>, but Xbox Series X/S consoles now support Dolby Vision for gaming.

The company is well-known for its collection of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-skullcandy-indy-true-wireless-earbuds-announced.html">true wireless</a> and noise-cancelling gear that offers solid performance for much less than a lot of the competition. Today, Skullcandy is announcing two more sets of true wireless earbuds — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Grind Fuel" href="https://fave.co/3zQlEvz">Grind Fuel</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Push Active" href="https://amzn.to/3CTJb0x">Push Active</a> — both of which offer a compelling set of features starting at $80. The company is also debuting its own voice platform, Skull-IQ, that allows you to do much of what your phone&#39;s voice assistant can handle, but with more of an audio focus. Get ready to say &quot;Hey Skullcandy&quot; a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>With Skull-IQ, Skullcandy has built a voice platform specifically catered to controlling music and its earbuds — and presumably its future headphones. In addition to a new command, you&#39;ll have the ability to play/pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, answer/reject calls, activate Stay Aware mode (ambient sound) and summon your device&#39;s built-in assistant. The company says it has also cooked up something novel. Skullcandy explains that it&#39;s the first to offer access to Spotify via voice command. Plenty of other companies give you one-tap ability to launch the service (these do that as well), but Skullcandy says it&#39;s the first to allow you to do it by speaking. Lastly, the company promises more features are coming in the future via over-the-air updates through the Skullcandy app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2f31b1f0-1ff4-11ec-b3ba-35f32af269a5" alt="Skullcandy Push Active" data-uuid="e5564356-fe4c-3183-90ae-23e3ce5083e5"><figcaption>Skullcandy Push Active</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skullcandy</div></figure><p>In terms of the new earbuds, some specs are the same for both models. Obviously, there are design differences as the Grind Fuel is a more &quot;traditional&quot; true wireless earbud while the Push Active is an over-the-ear hook option for a more secure fit. However, both feature the new Skull-IQ voice setup as well as &quot;supreme sound,&quot; that Stay Aware mode and what Skullcandy describes as noise-reducing mics for calls. The two new models are both IP55 rated sweat and water resistant with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-packs-tiles-location-tech-into-its-latest-wireless-earbuds-135549248.html">Tile tracking tech</a> built-in. They are also both equipped with on-board controls and a quick-charge feature that will give you two hours of listening time after 10 minutes in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>The Grind Fuel offers a few things the Push Active doesn&#39;t. Wireless charging and personalized sound via an in-app audio test are the two main ones. The Grind Fuel also has 9 hours of battery life on the buds with another 31 hours in the case. The Push Active will last 10 hours on a charge, while the case packs 34 more hours. Battery life isn&#39;t quite the same for both, but it&#39;s pretty close.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Push Active" href="https://amzn.to/3CTJb0x">Push Active</a> will cost $79.99 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Grind Fuel" href="https://fave.co/3zQlEvz">Grind Fuel</a> is $99.99. Both are available now from the Skullcandy website and other retailers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-skull-iq-voice-platform-true-wireless-earbuds-120021910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a181e758-aee7-4163-a147-d78ee523e155</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632831150</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T12:12:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f6c89220-1fee-11ec-b9fe-816b6e6e4628" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f6c89220-1fee-11ec-b9fe-816b6e6e4628" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skullcandy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skullcandy Grind Fuel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skullcandy Grind Fuel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung recruits Vanilla Ice to fight climate change]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-copy-and-paste-brain-neuromorphic-chips-185359994.html">Samsung</a> wants you to increase your freezer&#39;s temperature to lower our collective carbon footprint, and it has enlisted Vanilla Ice&#39;s help to convince you. The rapper has re-released his 1990 hit song <em>Ice Ice Baby</em> as <em>Reduce Your Ice, Ice Baby</em>, both to call on everyone to adjust their freezer&#39;s temp and to promote its new Bespoke Refrigerator range. &quot;Turn down the freeze, and I&#39;ll glow. Jus&#39; one degree, I raise the temp like a vandal, climate friendly, wax a chump like a candle,&quot; Vanilla Ice raps in the song.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on a study the tech giant conducted using European Commission data, if every household in Europe alone increases its freezer&#39;s temperature by one degree Celsius, it could lower humanity&#39;s carbon emissions by over a million tons annually. The company says that&#39;s equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide emitting by over 217,000 passenger vehicles being driven for an entire year. That&#39;s also equivalent to the yearly energy usage of over 120,000 homes combined. While it&#39;s hoping to convince you to adjust your freezer&#39;s temperature a bit, it does have a recommended minimum setting of -17 degrees Celsius or 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for the fridge Samsung is promoting, the new Bespoke Refrigerator has a modular design with interchangeable panels in 14 different colors and a range of finishes. The company says it could help reduce waste, because you&#39;ll be able to upgrade the fridge in the future instead of replacing it completely.

If you thought <em>Game of Thrones</em> invented long-running plot lines, tireless internet speculation and a lengthy, novelistic series of plot arcs, think again.

One of the biggest story arcs the series ran was the takeover of the Earth government by a xenophobic and paranoid president who was aided by a shadowy foreign power. Escapism!

In one example, Kaspersky showed a screenshot of a seller with 65,600 logs broken down by region, available for $150. They can also be sold individually — accounts with plenty of games, add-ons and expensive items are particularly valuable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The trojan stood out to researchers for its clever construction, using anti-debugging tools that make it hard to reverse engineer. Information is sent as a ZIP archive to a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server, protected against DDoS and other types of web attacks.&nbsp;</p><p>Kaspersky noted that it&#39;s seeing the malware around the globe and provided tips to avoid falling victim. It recommends buying apps only from official sources (not torrents) to avoid malware. It also recommends protecting your account with a strong password and, preferably, two-factor authentication. At the bottom of the post, it also provides guides to maxing out each platform&#39;s security settings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bloodystealer-trojan-targets-gamers-steam-gog-and-epic-accounts-105027673.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7fa53c65-b0c4-4c28-88cb-9a43585a2b0d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 10:50:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632826230</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T10:50:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dfe16b80-2044-11ec-8f9d-daac7d22d015" width="1760" height="860" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dfe16b80-2044-11ec-8f9d-daac7d22d015" width="1760" height="860" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kaspersky]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BloodyStealer trojan targets gamers' Steam, GOG and Epic accounts]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BloodyStealer trojan targets gamers' Steam, GOG and Epic accounts]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VR experience creator The Void is reportedly planning a comeback]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Void, which created in-person VR experiences but was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-void-vr-event-doubt-161437702.html">shutter its business</a> last year during the pandemic, may be coming back.
