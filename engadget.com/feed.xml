It&#39;s a joy to watch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html"><ins>especially on the big screen</ins></a>. But there&#39;s also an undersung element that ties everything together: sound design. It practically breathes life to the film — so much so that it makes <em>Dune&#39;s</em> wing-flapping ornithopter ships seem surprisingly real. The key to that magic, according to sound designers Theo Green and Mark Mangini, was a focus on capturing and using organic sounds, rather than fantastical digital creations.</p><p>Working together with <em>Dune&#39;s</em> director, Denis Villeneuve, the pair aimed to make &quot;a real-sounding science-fiction film with things we&#39;ve clearly never seen and heard before,&quot; Mangini said in an interview with Engadget.&quot;[It was] almost as if you put out a microphone and captured sounds as if those things actually existed. Everything we did ... is an outgrowth of that overarching philosophy to design a soundtrack for two hours and forty minutes that felt organic, as if we were [making] a documentary film.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fc825c2c94fc4b22a81827f28b5fde58"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWV3Om6oHCM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>That philosophy was essential to crafting the Bene Gesserit voice, a seemingly supernatural ability that allows members of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> religious order to control others. Think of it like the Jedi mind trick (<em>Star Wars</em> owes an absolute ton to <em>Dune, </em>don&#39;t forget). But instead of a hypnotic wave of the hand, the sound of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> voice is like a simultaneous kick to the gut and punch to the face. If you were somehow dozing off while the film&#39;s hero, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), tests his budding Bene Gesserit powers, you&#39;d be easily jolted awake.</p><p>To make that otherworldly voice a reality, Green credits three elements. There&#39;s the voice actor Jean Gilpin, who he says is “brilliant” at crafting witchy and ancestral voices. The sound designers also recorded <em>Dune&#39;s</em> actors saying their lines several different ways, which they played back through a subwoofer and recorded the final output. That&#39;s an age-old technique known as &quot;worldizing,&quot; or the act of recording audio that&#39;s being played back through speakers in a physical space.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e0-335a-11ec-9ffd-282aebcb8788" style="height:838;width:2000;" alt="Dune" data-uuid="fdc40a1d-4113-360b-b387-2b5e053f6bbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>The final component of the voice is the simplest: whenever a character starts to use that technique, the other sounds in the world fade away. In that early scene with Paul Atreides, we go from hearing the sounds of birds in the morning and a far-off thunderstorm to silence. That&#39;s an innately eerie effect that draws us into the interior world of the Bene Gesserit&#39;s powers: As Frank Herbert described it, they&#39;re calling on their ancestors and using advanced psychological techniques to manipulate others.</p><p>Green and Mangini went similarly old-school when designing the sound of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> ornithopter ships. They&#39;re the equivalent of helicopters in the film&#39;s universe, but they sound more like gigantic insects. To achieve that, Mangini says they combined the sounds of a large purring cat, a tent-strap flapping in high-velocity wind, and the fluttering wings of a large beetle. They weren&#39;t working from pre-existing sound libraries, either. Green had to bring a beetle into a quiet room and somehow get a decent recording.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f97d7b70-3e57-11ec-95f7-32cdcac573c1" style="height:822;width:1500;" alt="Dune Ornithopters" data-uuid="47162f18-bdbe-3649-86a0-5f4bcebb1676"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>All of that was just for the sounds of the ornithopters’ wings. To craft their propulsion system, the duo took recordings of beehives and modulated them to sound like RPMs revving up in a car&#39;s engine. The shifting of the ship&#39;s wings also came from an unlikely source: Mangini&#39;s Chevy Volt.</p><p>Once their work on <em>Dune</em> was over, the sound designers counted 3,200 new sounds that they developed for the film. Only three or four of them started out as electronic or synthetic sounds, Mangini says. That hearkens back to the way Villeneuve has approached visual effects in <em>Dune</em> and his earlier genre films: Go real whenever possible. For the sound designers, that push for authenticity also led to some inventive techniques. The gaping maw of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> enormous sandworms, for example, started out as the sound of Mangini half-swallowing a microphone.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f97d2d50-3e57-11ec-adff-265907ac70be" style="height:844;width:1500;" alt="Dune Ornithopters" data-uuid="bb01536d-f37c-37cf-885c-2261f9145781"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>Green likens the use of organic sounds as a way to avoid the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; that plagues some visual effects. Our eyes know when certain things look fake, and that takes us out of the reality of the film. &quot;I think [the uncanny valley] is in sound,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s those tiny complexities and tiny nuances that you only get from an organically sourced thing that sells something as being real.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dune-sound-design-interview-170027771.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b2d2529-8281-4a13-af23-c81771cf637c</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636131100</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T16:51:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro with MagSafe drop to $190, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first week of November brought a deluge of early Black Friday sales, many of which included some of our favorite gadgets at all-time-low prices.

There are dozens of factors to consider before pressing that big GO LIVE button on YouTube or Twitch, such as lighting, audio quality, video output and software organization — and that’s just to get on-air. If you want to succeed as a streamer, it also takes practice, charisma, luck and, of course, the proper equipment.</p><p>While we can’t help with the patience, natural talent or <a href="https://twitter.com/blackgirlgamers/status/1445797197757521921">social factors</a> that determine who becomes a streaming star, we can recommend the tools to make a channel look as professional as possible from day one.

According to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"><em>9to5Google&#39;s</em></a> deep dive into the current Google Camera APK, the phone is codenamed Pipit. While there aren&#39;t many concrete details about what the foldable looks like or how it functions, the APK offered some insights into the Pipit&#39;s camera setup.</p><p>Seemingly, the main camera will have the 12.2MP sensor Google used in its devices between the Pixel 3 and Pixel 5. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html"><ins>new Pixel 6 lineup</ins></a>, meanwhile, uses a 50MP GN1 camera.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pipit (or Pixel Fold, or whatever it will actually be called) is said to use the same 12MP IMX386 ultrawide sensor as the current Pixels, as well as two front-facing 8MP IMX355 sensors. There&#39;s likely to be one of those on each side of the body so folks can take selfies whether the device is folded or unfolded.</p><p>It makes sense that the main camera might not be as powerful as the one in the Pixel 6 lineup. Those phones have<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html"><ins> a protruding bar on the rear</ins></a> to give the camera sensors enough room. Size is a bigger concern on a foldable than a slab-style smartphone, given it&#39;s twice as thick when its closed. So, camera sensors with a slimmer profile might be preferable for Google in this case.</p><p>Samsung has also used lesser cameras in its foldables than in the flagship S Series devices. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</ins></a>, for instance, doesn&#39;t have as powerful cameras as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html"><ins>Galaxy S21 lineup</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, the APK includes the term “isPixel2022Foldable.&quot; That&#39;s a decent indication that Google plans to release a foldable device next year, given how Google has used similar terminology to refer to previous Pixel models.</p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, Google recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html"><ins>a version of Android designed for tablets and foldables</ins></a>.

The Roomba 694 also works with Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can activate it without even opening the app — just ask your preferred voice assistant to get it to start cleaning. This model should run for about 90 minutes when cleaning hard floors before it automatically returns to its base for a recharge. The Roomba 694 was already a great choice for those on a budget who wanted an iRobot device to clean their homes, but now it&#39;s a steal at this early Black Friday price.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-694-robot-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-of-180-124023035.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">558bb4a6-425d-490c-8da3-62dfe806f184</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:40:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636116025</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T12:40:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Is Meta’s metaverse crazy, or genius?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, Devindra and Engadget’s Jessica Conditt dive into Facebook’s big metaverse moves.

launch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Konami dropped Pro Evolution Soccer in favor of the new free-to-play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html"><em>eFootball franchise</em></a> with the promise of decent gameplay on the cheap. Unfortunately, the launch was nothing short of <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/efootball-and-its-weirdass-faces-is-the-worst-reviewed-game-in-steams-history/">woeful</a>, with bad player models, numerous glitches and an uproar over a $40 DLC that couldn&#39;t even be redeemed until a big version 1.0 update originally scheduled for this month.</p><p>Now, Konami is saying that this update is being pushed way back to spring of 2022.  As such, it&#39;s refunding players who pulled the trigger on that DLC and forcing them to reinstall the game. &quot;If you have pre-ordered the Premium Player Pack and wish to continue to play <em>eFootball 2022</em>, you will need to re-download the core game after the pre-order has been cancelled. We apologize for the inconvenience,&quot; the company wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bf532040-3e29-11ec-ad6f-95a246ff5b42" style="height:608;width:1080;" alt="Konami is refunding players who bought pricey DLC after disastrous &#39;eFootball&#39; launch" data-uuid="89e36dfd-4fea-3e90-a660-22df96d25a02"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Konami</div></figure><p>To make the game more usable in the near term, Konami released an update (v0.9.1) &quot;to fix numerous bugs sequentially on each platform starting today (November 5th),&quot; it wrote. Left unsaid there is the severity of the glitches, which make for some pretty cringe reading. Choice ones include &quot;the referee may be shown as being trapped on the surface of the pitch,&quot; &quot;pitch grass is not shown three-dimensionally,&quot; and &quot;players may get caught up in the goal net when performing a goal celebration close to the goal.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s hard to be optimistic given the issues Konami has had with its football games, but the company did buy itself some more time. We now have to wait until spring 2022 to see if it can do anything to turn <em>eFootball</em> around.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/konami-forced-to-refund-e-football-players-who-bought-dlc-after-disastrous-launch-120555305.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee4672ab-5275-4b7b-ab74-d49f33945ac2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 12:05:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636111873</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T11:31:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed33ff50-3e26-11ec-a1df-a0e17863c362" width="1820" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ed33ff50-3e26-11ec-a1df-a0e17863c362" width="1820" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ Konami Digital Entertainment / Konami via Steam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami forced to refund 'eFootball' players who bought expensive DLC after disastrous launch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami forced to refund 'eFootball' players who bought expensive DLC after disastrous launch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The electric motorcycle with speed upgrades via in-app payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Zero Motorcycles’ new electric motorbike is taking a thoroughly 2020s approach to upgrades.

MIT&#39;s CSAIL computer science researchers are trying to fix that by teaching robots how to interact with other robots to to further their own goals, according to a <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/event/formalizing-teamwork-human-robot-interaction">new paper</a>. The research could lead to improved human-robot interactions in assisted living facilities, for instance, and even help psychologists better measure social interactions between humans.&nbsp;</p><p>To study these interactions, the researchers created a simulated 2D environment that allowed virtual robots to pursue both social and physical goals. For instance, a physical goal might be to navigate to a tree at a certain point on a grid, while a social goal is guessing what another robot is trying to do and then acting based on that, &quot;like helping another robot water the tree,&quot; according to CSAIL.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The robot is rewarded for actions that get it closer to its goals, with a matching reward for helping and an opposite reward for hindering it. The team created three types of robots: The first has only physical goals, the second has physical and social goals, but assumes all robots only have physical goals. The third one assumes the others all have social and physical goals, so it can take more advanced actions like joining with others to achieve a goal.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Even young infants seem to understand social interactions like helping and hindering, but we don’t yet have machines that can perform this reasoning at anything like human-level flexibility.</p></blockquote><p>The team created 98 different scenarios with all three types of robots. Twelve humans watched nearly 200 video clips of the robots interacting, and then had to estimate the physical and social goals. &quot;In most instance, their model agreed with what the humans thought about the social interactions that were occurring in each frame,&quot; the researchers said.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers hope that the results will act as a &quot;benchmark&quot; that allows others to work on similar social interactions. Next, they plan to create more complex environment with 3D agents that allows more types of interactions. The eventual aim is to not just teach robots how to interact better socially, but &quot;dig deeper into the human aspect of this,&quot; said senior author Andrei Barbu. &quot;Can we make an objective test for your ability to recognize social interactions? Maybe there is a way to teach people to recognize these social interactions and improve their abilities.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/researchers-are-working-on-giving-robots-social-skills-105557425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc1ff9a3-6091-4672-bb41-641fd92d1507</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 10:55:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636115298</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T12:28:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b7b4260-3e18-11ec-bde7-02789757ead0" width="900" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b7b4260-3e18-11ec-bde7-02789757ead0" width="900" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Researchers are working on giving robots social skills]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Researchers are working on giving robots social skills]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta is reportedly planning physical stores to showcase its products]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The company formerly known as Facebook has been discussing the possibility of opening retail stores way before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">rebranded</a> itself as Meta, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/05/technology/facebook-stores-meta-metaverse.html?referringSource=articleShare"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.

The stores could also showcase the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">augmented reality smart glasses</a> called Stories that Facebook developed with Ray-Ban. Based on the documents <em>The Times</em> saw, Meta&#39;s goal is to spark &quot;curiosity&quot; and &quot;closeness&quot; with its stores, as well as provide customers with a welcoming atmosphere where they can have a &quot;judgment free journey&quot; while experimenting with headsets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those same documents show that Meta envisions shops with a modern, minimalist aesthetic and subtle branding placement. The company considered a lot of possible names, such as Facebook Hub, Facebook Commons, Facebook Innovations, Facebook Reality Store and From Facebook. It eventually settled on Facebook Store, but that will mostly likely change now that the company has been renamed.</p><p>If Meta does push through with this plan, its first retail/experience store will be located in Burlingame, California, where there&#39;s a Reality Labs office. <em>The Times </em>says the project could eventually span the world, though, with locations in various countries and regions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-physical-stores-reality-labs-products-101802202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ec90835-170f-470f-976b-5b91052046d4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 10:18:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636107498</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T10:18:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/83da8ca0-3e1b-11ec-bbad-2de529329ff6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/83da8ca0-3e1b-11ec-bbad-2de529329ff6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meta Quest 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Meta Quest 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shure launches its first hook-free wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At least year&#39;s CES, Shure presented its first true wireless earbuds called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-shure-aonic-50-aonic-215-wireless.html">Aonic 215</a> — it even released the model&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shure-aonic-215-gen-2-earbuds-152055062.html">second-gen version</a> this September.

After unveiling the outrageous full-frame <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html">Ronin 4K</a> camera/gimbal last month, it has now <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:launched" href="https://amzn.to/3EMRcFz">launched</a> the $2,200 <a href="http://www.dji.com/mavic-3">Mavic 3 drone</a> with not just one, but two innovative camera systems.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-may-have-a-bigger-sensor-and-46-minute-flight-time-090542963.html">rumored</a>, there are two models in the Mavic 3 family, the Standard and Cine models, along with a &quot;Fly More&quot; combo that bundles more accessories. The main difference is that the Mavic 3 Cine has a built-in 1TB SSD and supports Apple ProRes 422 HQ video recording — highly desirable for professional film productions. The latter is also considerably more expensive, as I&#39;ll discuss shortly.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/aaa21760-3d6a-11ec-b779-d2d3cc798a96" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="d4c1b6de-f892-3d58-b7e3-ef7a648d2e22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3&#39;s main 24mm (35mm-equivalent) f/2.8 - f/11 Hasselblad-branded camera has a Four Thirds sensor that&#39;s considerably larger than the 1-inch sensor on the current Air 2S model. And yet, the camera module doesn&#39;t look much bigger and the Mavic 3 weighs slightly less than the Mavic 2 (895g compared to 907g).&nbsp;</p><p>Four Thirds is the same size as the Micro Four Thirds sensor on Panasonic&#39;s BGH1 box camera, for example, so it should allow for more cinematic video and photos. The variable aperture, along with optional ND filters, will make it easier to shoot in a variety of lighting conditions. It also comes with a new autofocus system called Vision Detection that supposedly optimizes focusing speeds.</p><p>With the main camera, it now shoots 5.1K video at 50fps, or 4K at 120 fps — up from 5.4K 30fps and 4K/60p video on the Air 2S. DJI claims a native dynamic range of 12.8 stops, thanks to the 10-bit D-Log color profile. As for still images, it can shoot 20-megapixel photos in 12-bit RAW.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="fd282bd4-fec5-4d9f-8499-6904baf71c54"/><p>If you need to get in much, much closer, DJI has squeezed in a second camera directly above the main camera. This one has a half-inch 12-megapixel sensor and 162mm tele lens (35mm equivalent), which is around a 4X zoom, or claimed 28X hybrid zoom. The aperture is fixed at f/4.4, and it offers strictly automatic, rather than manual exposure control. It can capture 4K video at up to 30 fps.&nbsp;</p><p>DJI has confirmed that the Mavic 3 will have up to 46 minutes of autonomy in ideal conditions (40 minutes of hover), as leaks had suggested. That&#39;s up pretty massively from the Mavic 2 Pro or Air 2S, both of which offer 31 minutes of flying time. It can also fly a bit faster too, at 47 MPH compared to 45 MPH. Those capabilities were enabled by a higher-capacity battery, more energy-efficient motors/propellers and a more streamlined shape on the Mavic 3&#39;s arms, body and gimbal. &quot;Wind tunnel testing shows Mavic 3 produces 35 percent less drag than previous generations,&quot; DJI wrote.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d30fab90-3d6a-11ec-bfff-97ac713093d1" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="616a3634-2c08-3f89-b97a-2ffaf2b7e4e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 also offers enhanced flight safety thanks to its updated APAS 5.0 system that uses inputs from six fish-eye vision sensor and two wide-angle sensors to detect and avoid obstacles. Meanwhile, the ActiveTrack 5.0 system has new options for tracking subjects no matter which way they&#39;re moving, and it can even continue to track a subject if it moves out of frame and pick it back up when it reappears. All of that allows &quot;more fluid and diverse drone and camera movement,&quot; DJI said.&nbsp;</p><p>It also comes with an improved RTH (Return to Home) system that works by automatically calculating the shortest, safest and most energy-efficient route to land back at its home point. It can take into account wind speed and power when calculating the path, giving users a bit more flying time before triggering the RTH action.  Another updated feature is O3+ signal loss prevention that allows for a maximum control range of 15 km. Mavic 3 is also DJI&#39;s first drone with a 1080p 60fps transmission speed on the live feed, meaning &quot;the camera view is displayed at a resolution close to what the camera actually records,&quot; DJI notes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff4d5a90-3d6a-11ec-bd19-948f9c2573ba" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="01149e62-4b21-357e-8018-d64f07ca3a61"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Along with the drone, DJI introduced a number of new accessories, including a new DJI RC Pro smart controller, a 65W Portable Charger that&#39;s compatible with notebooks and smartphones and allows for fast charging (around 96 minutes), a wide-angle lens and two sets of ND filters (ND4/8/16/32 and ND64/128/256/512) that allow for shooting in bright sunlight. It also introduced a carrying bag that converts into a backpack that can fit the drone, a laptop and other accessories.&nbsp;</p><p>Engadget received the drone just yesterday, so we haven&#39;t had a chance to fly it yet — stay tuned for a full review. However, I&#39;m impressed so far by the design and small details like the storage cover that protects the camera, gimbals and propeller (below). It&#39;s also clear that DJI has put a lot of thought into the new charging system and batteries that should make operation more practical. Even the carrying bag/backpack is well conceived, with pockets and sleeves for the batteries, ND filters and more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1f0eee70-3d6b-11ec-b2ac-b40dfee8cece" alt="DJI&#39;s Mavic 3 drone fits in a Four Thirds and 28x hybrid zoom camera" data-uuid="54174dc9-aaa0-346f-9477-3fec741d79f2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As you may have noticed, the drawback with the Mavic 3 is the relatively high price. Rather than $1,600 as was rumored, the Mavic 3 starts at $2,200 for the Standard model, which includes the Mavic 3 drone, storage cover, one battery and charger, the RC-N1 remote control &quot;and other essential items.&quot; The $3,000 Mavic 3 Fly More Combo adds two extra batteries (three total), a three-battery charging hub, the ND4/8/16/32 filter set and the fancy bag/backpack.</p><p>Finally, the $5,000 Mavic 3 Cine Premium Combo gives you all that plus the aforementioned 1TB SSD and Apple ProRes 422 HQ recording (arriving in January 2022). It adds a few more accessories to the Fly More Combo as well, including the RC Pro remote, ND64/128/256/512 filters and the DJI 10Gbps data cable. Five grand is obviously lot of money, but the Cine model is aimed more at professional film producers.

All told, they’re minor additions individually but should make Alexa more helpful to those who use the digital assistant every day.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-october-monthly-update-224116039.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04870891-e74e-42bd-b49d-52b260105855</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 22:41:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636065679</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T22:41:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/386ffa80-1a3e-11ec-ab3c-bd69902e087c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/386ffa80-1a3e-11ec-ab3c-bd69902e087c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A former Rivian executive sues the automaker for gender discrimination]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electric transport startup Rivian has been sued by one of its former employees. Per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-rivian-executive-sues-for-gender-discrimination-ahead-of-ipo-11636054512"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraschwab1/life-outside-the-boys-club-why-i-spoke-up-about-rivians-toxic-bro-culture-and-got-fired-15600b999ae7">Laura Schwab</a>, an executive who was a vice president of sales and marketing at the automaker until last month, filed a gender discrimination complaint with the California Superior Court in Orange County on Thursday. In the lawsuit, Schwab alleges she was fired by Rivian after she complained of a “toxic ‘bro culture’” that saw other executives exclude her from meetings and ignore her advice.</p><p>“The culture at Rivian was actually the worst I’ve experienced in over 20 years in the automotive industry,” Schwab told <em>The Journal</em>. A veteran of the automotive industry, Schwab held executive posts at Aston Martin Lagonda and Jaguar Land Rover before she joined Rivian in November 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the outlet, Schwab tried to push the company to address numerous concerns while she was there. In one instance, she allegedly tried to tell the other executives on Rivian’s leadership team that the company had underpriced its vehicles. In yet another situation, she tried to raise concerns about the quality of the automaker’s manufacturing process. In the former case, the company allegedly initially dismissed her advice only to later follow through on it after a male executive raised the same issue.</p><p>The suit comes ahead of Rivian’s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/01/electric-vehicle-maker-rivian-seeks-to-raise-8-4-billion-in-ipo/"><ins>planned IPO next week</ins></a> where the company will seek to raise as much as $9.6 billion in additional investment. It also recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html"><ins>started producing</ins></a> R1T trucks for customers. More broadly, the suit comes as several other companies in the tech space face scrutiny over their gender equality practices. Most notably, there’s Activision Blizzard, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sued by California’s fair employment regulator</ins></a> in July for fostering what it described as a sexist “frat boy” workplace culture. The fallout from that lawsuit has been far-reaching. Following months of pressure from employees, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html"><ins>ended its policy of forced arbitration</ins></a> in cases involving sexual harassment and discrimination and put in place a zero-tolerance stance toward harassment.</p><p>Citing the quiet period ahead of its IPO, Rivian declined to comment on the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">439c9edf-5f94-4ecb-8eb3-1eb8cdce8bf3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 21:38:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636062311</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T21:45:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f9fb9440-0d03-11ec-ab79-2b81c53451d0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f9fb9440-0d03-11ec-ab79-2b81c53451d0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rivian]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rivian]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rivian]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly lifting mask requirements at some US stores tomorrow]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple might loosen its mask requirements at some stores after months of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-covid-075205722.html">taking a cautious approach</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-04/apple-to-drop-mask-mandate-at-many-u-s-stores-on-falling-cases?sref=10lNAhZ9">claimed</a> to have an Apple memo outlining plans to lift mask requirements at more than 100 of the iPhone maker&#39;s roughly 270 US stores. The policy will reportedly apply to stores in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York before spreading to other states and shops. Apple has declined to comment.</p><p>The company is lifting the requirements due to declining COVID-19 case numbers and improving vaccination rates, according to the memo. The policy will apply regardless of a customer&#39;s vaccination status, although retail staff will still have to wear masks due to longer interactions and closer contact. Stores will still require masks for everyone in areas where the local government demands the safety measure, such as in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has frequently changed its retail policies as the pandemic has evolved. It has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-closes-stores-in-california-and-the-uk-as-covid-19-cases-soar-083013840.html">closed</a> and reopened stores based on case levels, for instance. It scrapped the mask requirement in many US stores in June only to bring them back a month later.</p><p>Provided the leak is accurate, it&#39;s far too soon to say whether or not this policy shift will stick. The pandemic hasn&#39;t been entirely predictable, to put it mildly. However, a change in mask requirements would certainly reflect Apple&#39;s hopes of returning to pre-pandemic conditions as soon as possible, both in stores and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html">in the office</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-lifts-mask-requirements-in-some-us-stores-205206291.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">91c475ee-daa4-48b5-8c47-a5706f5919e9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 20:52:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636059128</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:52:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/904900b0-3dae-11ec-ba8f-d51a04c36a8f" width="6576" height="4384" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/904900b0-3dae-11ec-ba8f-d51a04c36a8f" width="6576" height="4384" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Genaro Molina via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BEVERLY HILLS, CA - OCTOBER 08, 2020 - A customer service representative works with customers at the Apple store as shoppers return to indoor shopping after Los Angeles County eased restrictions at places like the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills on October 8, 2020.

It just might. Porsche is developing a &quot;digital twin&quot; (that is, a virtual copy) that helps predict service requirements based on driving styles. Algorithms can parse a combination of sensor data and &quot;big data&quot; to recommend service based on your driving style. You may need early work on your suspension if you take your car to the track, or the engine if you have a long highway commute.</p><p>The system can even anticipate faults before they happen. That will please mechanics, of course, but it could also keep you safe (and spare you additional repair costs) by scheduling maintenance long before there&#39;s a crisis.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Porsche doesn&#39;t officially launch its first digital twin until 2022, and then only using sensor data. Field testing is already underway however — about half of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> owners have volunteered for a pilot that anonymously monitors the EV&#39;s air suspension for body acceleration. If the car ventures past certain thresholds, the vehicle tells the driver they may need to visit a repair shop.</p><p>The twin system would let automakers ditch fixed maintenance schedules in favor of driver-specific recommendations. Porsche also envisions the algorithms helping even when your car is running flawlessly. You&#39;d have a digital record that could both suggest an accurate selling price for a used car as well as greater transparency for would-be buyers. Car brands could even pitch extended warranties based on the status of your car. So long as companies take privacy into account, though, this could save you more than a little stress (and moments of sheer panic) on the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-digital-twin-predicts-service-202153543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06e3ab42-72a7-4cdf-a928-611209e6f684</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 20:21:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636057792</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:30:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Square makes its Cash App available for teen use]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/square/">Square</a> is now <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/status/1455942956343611399"><ins>allowing all teenagers</ins></a> to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cash%20app/"><ins>Cash App</ins></a>, after restricting it to adults until now.

They’re both trying to address the problem of skyrocketing drug development costs. A recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054832"><ins>2020</ins></a> study found that it costs on average $1.3 billion to create a new pharmaceutical. A lot of that has to do with the process itself. As things stand today, researchers physically synthesize each and every promising compound and then test to see if it’s safe for human use. And as they have tried to develop treatments for more complicated diseases, fewer drugs are passing human trials.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-isomorphic-labs-announcement-193546886.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f4af1af-4430-477f-af02-d1fcd04a0a8b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 19:35:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636054550</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T19:36:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DeepMind]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot brings 'League of Legends,' Valorant' and other titles to Epic Games Store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Riot Games is taking its PC titles into new territory as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/league%20of%20legends/"><em><ins>League of Legends</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valorant/"><em><ins>Valorant</ins></em></a>, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> and <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> are all now available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Epic%20Games%20Store/"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>.

The motorcycle will ship with the company’s Cypher III+ operating system, which includes the Cypher Store. And if you plan to get the most out of the 2022 SR, you’ll need to spend money at the marketplace. Post-purchase “DLC” is something we’ve seen the automotive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-connected-drive-store-subscriptions-193746962.html">industry show increasing interest</a> in recent years.</p><p>At first, the Cypher Store will offer a mix of performance and comfort upgrades. It will later expand to sell purchases that enable features like a park mode, heated grips and faster charging. How much you’ll need to pay for those extras will depend on the model you own.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/089f2c70-3d9a-11ec-ab7d-192cba143aec" alt="Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR" data-uuid="c6f588ff-b136-3492-9bfd-899059db4875"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zero Motorcycles</div></figure><p>In the case of the 2022 SR, it comes standard with a 14.4 kWh battery. You can upgrade its capacity to 15.6 kWh and then 17.3 kWh. In 2022, Zero Motorcycles will start selling an optional tank accessory that further increases the amount of power the motorcycle’s ZF 75-10 electric motor can access. With every possible upgrade, battery capacity increases to 20.9 kWh. At that point, Zero claims you can expect approximately 227 miles of range when driving in a city and about 113 miles at a more consistent 70 miles per hour clip. For charging, the 2022 SR features a standard J1772 connection, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html">even Tesla sells now</a>.</p><p>By default, the 2022 SR’s motor outputs 122 lb-ft of torque and 74 horsepower. It can hit a top speed of 104 miles per hour. As you might have guessed, you can pay extra to unlock better performance from the motor. With a $1,795 in-app purchase, power output increases to 113 horsepower, allowing the 2022 SR to go as fast as 124 miles per hour.</p><p>The 2022 SR will start at $17,995 when it debuts at dealerships in the first quarter of 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-2022-sr-annoucement-181805528.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3091fdd-413c-4d31-a2f8-d8796c2bb6d0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:18:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636059719</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T21:02:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
