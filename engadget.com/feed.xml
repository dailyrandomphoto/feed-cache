Now, however, it has. The company just announced that you’ll be able to pre-order the Playdate for $179 on July 29th at 1pm ET.</p><p>Additionally, the Playdate Cover, a purple protective cover for the handheld, will also be available for pre-order for $29. If you’re going to get both, it makes more sense to just get the Playdate and Cover bundle, which is priced at $199. As for the recently announced Playdate Stereo Dock, however, that isn’t ready for pre-orders just yet as it’s still in development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a press release, Panic said that the first batch of Playdate units, which should be around 20,000, will start shipping by the end of this year. After selling this initial allotment, it will then ship subsequent orders in 2022. The company also wanted to assure customers that the Playdate will never “sell out;” you’ll just have to wait in line, as the production is adjusted based on demand.</p><p>Pre-orders will require payment upfront, but Panic says it can be cancelled at any time for a full refund. Orders are limited to two units per person. The Playdate will ship initially to the following countries — the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. It’s also looking into selling the devices in Malaysia, where the factory is located (if you’re in Malaysia, you can fill out <a href="https://panic-inc.typeform.com/to/dyaeItXv">this form</a> so Panic can keep you posted). International shipping costs will include any duties or taxes.</p><p>If you still can’t get enough Playdate, Panic also announced that it’s debuting a new Playdate-focused podcast next week that will give you a lot more background and information about the little handheld gaming console.

The company recently announced that the Playdate will be <a href="http://play.date/">available for pre-order</a> on July 29th for $179, with a ship date of later this year. I’ve been playing with a “press preview” version of the Playdate for the past couple of weeks, and while it’s not perfect, I still think it’s an incredibly charming handheld with a lot of potential. The question is whether there’ll be enough interest — from both developers and consumers — to keep it going for the long haul.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f2756935-7bec-48db-aff9-d8139c2d00e7"/><p>For the uninitiated, the Playdate is not just Panic’s first-ever gaming handheld; it’s also the company’s first piece of hardware, period. Panic made its name making Mac software like Transmit and Coda, and has recently ventured into publishing indie games such as <em>Firewatch</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game</em> and the yet-to-be-released <em>Nour: Play With Your Food</em>. From its inception, Panic wanted Playdate to be a different kind of handheld; instead of something mainstream like Nintendo’s Switch, it was supposed to be more like the Game &amp; Watch devices of yore, but with a modern twist. “We didn’t want it to be too cool, but we didn’t want it to be too goofy,” said Cabel Sasser, Panic’s co-founder.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thanks to a design collaboration with Teenage Engineering, known mostly for making quirky audio gear, the Playdate certainly fulfills that brief. The hardware is tiny; about the size of a stack of Post-It notes (76 x 74 x 9 mm), and has a black-and-white screen. But its most unique design feature is its fold-out crank, which acts as an additional game controller. It’s this combination of silly and adorable that adds to the Playdate’s charm, and I’ll fully admit that I fell for it the first time I tried a prototype back in 2019.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17733a20-eac0-11eb-bd7b-d2a821ab0f00" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="13493ee1-697d-35d0-8f05-2b4aff147182"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The aforementioned preview unit I have on-hand is the final hardware, though the software isn’t quite there yet. Everything is similar to how it was two years ago. The button placement is the same, with the D-pad and A and B buttons under the display, the menu button on the right, and the lock button sitting on the top (you activate the Playdate by pressing the lock button twice; pressing it again will enable standby mode). All the controls feel responsive enough, with a pleasant clickiness. On the side is the mono speaker, which is surprisingly loud and clear given its size. Underneath is a 3.5mm headphone jack plus a USB-C charging port.</p><p>Most important to me, however, was that crank, which is housed on the Playdate’s right side. To access it, simply flip it open to reveal a small rotating yellow handle, which you can then use to rotate the arm backwards or forwards. The whole contraption feels a lot more solid than I remember; the rotation feels silky smooth, but it isn’t so loose that it continues to spin when I let go. This is a good thing, as it allows for more precise control, which turns out to be quite important in certain games. Internally, the Playdate has a 180 MHz Cortex M7 CPU, 16MB of RAM, 4GB of Flash storage, Bluetooth, and 802.11 bgn 2.4GHz Wi-Fi.</p><p>The Playdate is molded from what Panic says is an extremely durable engineering thermoplastic, and the screen is laminated to a hardened glass face. That aforementioned crank is also pretty solid; it’s made out of stainless steel, and the handle is plastic with a stainless steel core. The Playdate will likely survive the occasional jostle in your pocket or bag. But if you want to keep it completely free of blemishes, Panic does offer a cover for $29 (You could also purchase the Playdate bundled with the cover for $199).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d7efed0-eac0-11eb-bbfd-b5d151f35301" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="53cdb6d1-7a94-31fd-bfff-edcd79eb95d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>While I do like the hardware for the most part, I have to admit I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the screen. One of the reasons Panic chose to go with a Sharp Memory LCD was because of its super-sharp pixels that use very little power (Pebble aficionados might recall that its eponymous smartwatch used Sharp Memory LCDs as well). I agree that the black and white images do look very crisp, especially in bright sunlight. However, the Playdate lacks any kind of backlight or front light, which means it’s terrible in dim environments. Maybe it’s because I live and work in a relatively dark room, but I found this rather annoying. At one point I had to position a book light underneath the Playdate just to play a game on the couch.</p><p>I should note that the Playdate does last a long time in between charges. I’ve left it unplugged for nearly two weeks now, and even though I’ve played a few hours every day, it still has over half of its battery life left.</p><p>I also noticed an “Upside Down” mode in the Settings menu, which turns the screen, well, upside down. When asked, Sasser said that this is an experimental mode for left-handed users who want to use the crank with their left hands. He did say, however, that this is feature is still subject to change.</p><p>As wonderful as the hardware is, the real value of the Playdate is the content. Though the device costs $179, it will now come with 24 different titles instead of the initial 12 (it’ll also ship with 4GB of storage instead of 2). My preview unit only came with four games however: <em>Crankin’s Time Travel Adventure</em>, <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, <em>Saturday Edition </em>and <em>Whitewater Wipeout</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4bd93a80-eac0-11eb-bfed-b43cad792d9e" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="851100a8-7ddc-3935-a581-cfc68142cdd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I had already played <em>Crankin</em>’ a couple of years ago when I tried the Playdate for the first time. Designed by Katamari Damacy’s Keita Takahashi, the only controller in this game is the crank, which you’ll use to hurry Crankin along his path to meet his girlfriend, Crankette. Spinning it forward will move him forward, while spinning it backward will get Crankin to do the same. The trick is that you have to navigate various obstacles like bees and birds, which exist outside the flow of time. So as you rush along, you have to position Crankin in such a way that he can avoid them. For example, you’ll want Crankin to bend down to smell the flowers exactly when the bees fly overhead.</p><p>That might seem like a relatively easy premise, but the obstacles get more complicated as the levels progress, forcing me to replay them several times before I can get them right. Currently, I’m stuck on level five despite multiple attempts. Guess I’m not going to see Crankette any time soon.</p><p>I much prefer <em>Lost Your Marbles</em>, which was designed by Sweet Baby Inc &amp; Friends. In this game, a girl named Prota is going to work for a cat scientist named Marbels (no that’s not a typo), but unwittingly brings her dog Minty along on her first day. Let’s just say that things don’t go well, and Minty eventually goes missing. Somehow, Prota also, uh, loses her “marbles” in the process. As Prota goes around town trying to find her dog, you answer questions by using the crank to roll a marble around an obstacle-filled construction, making sure that the marble hits the answer you want (It’s not explicitly said, but my guess is that the marble puzzle here represents Prota’s brain).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63dab4b0-eac0-11eb-bd9d-cdf334d8b531" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="eaa6c4e4-69ab-3756-9a65-ee24b76690f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I found it a little tricky to control the marble, so I ended up picking a lot of what I thought were incorrect answers. But I soon found out that there’s really no such thing as the wrong answer in this game. That’s because the weirder the answer, the more hilarious the story becomes. For example, when you’re picking the photo for Minty’s missing dog poster, one of the options is for her butt. I didn’t mean to select it, but I did so accidentally. I know this all sounds incredibly silly, and it is, but I also found the whole thing very amusing.</p><p><em>Saturday Edition</em>, on the other hand, is a lot more serious, at least on the surface. Developed by Chris Makris, this is a point-and-click style adventure game which doesn’t use the crank at all. Instead, all navigation is done via the D-pad and A and B buttons. In this game, you play the character of John Kornfield who’s had a long history with aliens, but is currently on Earth.</p><p>The game opens with him in his apartment, and the cops are knocking on the door. Using the controls, you’re able to interact with various elements in the apartment like listening to the answering machine or opening the microwave. The game suggested to me that it’s a lot wiser to exit the apartment via the fire escape instead, so I did. I’ll admit that I haven’t gotten very far in this game — I’ve so far only been to his office and the nearby shopping mall. I do find the story quite intriguing so far, but I’m going to have to sink in a few more hours before I uncover all the game’s secrets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98354360-eac0-11eb-bdf8-066e86715df8" alt="Playdate" data-uuid="4618d6d3-b649-3954-9e80-33235a5bfc54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Last but not least is <em>Whitewater Wipeout, </em>by Chuhai Labs. All you have to do here is surf for as long as possible, performing tricks along the way to earn points. Like <em>Crankin</em>, the only controller here is the crank, which you’ll use to move the surfboard. The highest score I’ve achieved so far is 35, which is not great at all. There will eventually be a global leaderboard which you can use to compare your skills to others.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, my favorite games are the ones with a heavy story element, such as <em>Lost Your Marbles</em> and <em>Saturday Edition</em>. I am not very good with hand-eye coordination, so <em>Crankin</em>’ and <em>Wipeout</em> are not really my thing. I’ll also add that after a week or so of playing the same four games over and over, I got bored pretty quickly.</p><p>Thankfully, however, the Playdate will definitely be getting more games. As part of its $179 price, the console actually comes bundled with a season’s worth of titles — 24 games in total. The first two games will start downloading the moment you activate your Playdate, and then you’ll get two games every Monday thereafter for 11 weeks.</p><p>That is, fundamentally, the sticking point with any console like this — as quirky and glorious as the hardware is, it’ll live and die in the amount of new games you can add to this on a regular basis. The indie gaming community has already embraced the Playdate wholeheartedly — tens of thousands of developers have already expressed interest in making games for it — and the company announced that they’ll be able to sell software and games that can be sideloaded to the device.</p><p>There’s no denying that the Playdate is a fairly niche device — it’s an indie handheld made for indie games — and that’s the very thing that is so appealing about it. But it’s unclear if interest in the Playdate will last beyond its initial release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/playdate-preview-170047433.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e1ecfbc-7157-4e42-93dd-f60cf005936c</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 17:00:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626972399</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T16:47:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7669710-eabf-11eb-babb-322abab2b70c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Playdate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Large chunks of the internet went down due a DNS issue]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you can&#39;t access online services like Sony&#39;s PlayStation Network and Steam, as well as websites like Airbnb, you&#39;re not the only one. Starting at approximately 11:20AM ET, <a href="https://downdetector.ca/status/playstation-network/">Downdetector</a> began logging a spike in outage reports across a variety of online services and websites. Outside of PSN and Steam, some of the more notable platforms people can&#39;t seem to connect to include LastPass, TikTok and UPS. Visiting the PlayStation Store and other affected websites, they come back with a DNS error.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/satyan/status/1418242897317535749">Based on Twitter reports</a>, the source of the problem is Akamai, one of the largest content delivery networks in the world. &quot;We are aware of an emerging issue with the Edge DNS service,&quot; the company said in an <a href="https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv">update</a> it posted on its website at 12:09PM ET. &quot;We are actively investigating the issue.&quot; As of the writing of this article, Akamai has not said what&#39;s causing the issue.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DNS outages aren&#39;t uncommon, but it&#39;s not often they make large parts of the internet inaccessible. In recent memory, one of the most disruptive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-21-some-of-the-biggest-sites-on-the-internet-were-shut-down-this-mo.html">occurred in 2016</a> when a teen used the infamous Mirai malware to build out a botnet and carry out a series of distributed denial of service attacks against Dyn, one of the largest DNS providers in the US. The attacks made it so that people in the US and parts of Europe couldn&#39;t access websites like Amazon, GitHub, PayPal and Reddit for almost an entire day. The individual behind the Dyn cyberattack eventually pleaded guilty for what they did, but not before a variety of groups like Anonymous and New World Hackers claimed responsibility.</p><p><strong>Update 12:54PM ET</strong>: Moments ago, Akamai said it <a href="https://edgedns.status.akamai.com/incidents/n5zl6dythvfv">implemented a fix</a> for the issue it was having with its Edge DNS service. Many of the websites that were affected by the outage are starting to come back online, including PSN. Downdetector is also tracking fewer outage reports.&nbsp;</p><div id="1b5d2319160d47cc9625689f97bf0daa"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have implemented a fix for this issue, and based on current observations, the service is resuming normal operations.

Now called Wear OS 3, the opt-in update (more on that in a moment) will be available in &quot;mid to second half&quot; 2022, and then only for a handful of watches.</p><p>You&#39;ll need one of Mobvoi&#39;s more recent TicWatch models (E3, Pro 3 Cellular/LTE or Pro 3 GPS) or one of the new Fossil watches arriving later in 2021. In other words, you&#39;ll be stuck if you bought a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-20-mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-2020-announcement.html">2020 TicWatch</a>, a Fossil Gen 5, the revived Moto 360 or any other Wear OS watch. Google is still promising current owners &quot;new app experiences&quot; like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-update-apps-103556477.html">Play Store update</a>, not to mention security updates for at least two years after release. Still, that leaves many devotees without a path to Wear OS 3 short of buying new wristwear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update will also be opt-in for a reason. The &quot;extent of changes&quot; in Wear OS 3 will require that you reset your watch to factory settings — not surprisingly, Google wants to ask nicely before wiping your device. While this reset won&#39;t be as huge a setback as it would be if it were your phone, you&#39;ll want to think carefully before moving forward.</p><p>The hardware cutoff isn&#39;t a complete shock. Many Wear OS watches on the market are using the three-year-old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-10-qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-3100.html">Snapdragon Wear 3100</a>, and even the much-improved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Wear 4100</a> has been around since 2020. Google might have needed to limit Wear OS 3&#39;s features to support aging processors. Whatever the rationale, this could result in a bumpy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-06-20-microsoft-unveils-windows-phone-7-8-for-legacy-devices.html">Windows Phone 8-style</a> transition where existing owners have to make difficult choices about when (or if) they replace their devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7914731-4bc9-4b73-8228-90eabee62952</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 16:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626960499</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:28:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/136ea530-eae9-11eb-bfbf-317473ab8457" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Wear OS 3 preview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introducing Engadget’s 2021 back-to-school gift guide!]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We know you may not be ready to go back to school just yet — but being prepared for the inevitable return can’t hurt.

Created by Nirav Patel, formerly of Oculus, the machine aims to demonstrate that there is a better, more sustainable way of doing things. It shouldn’t be that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-09-google-repair-ads.html">if your tech fails</a>, you either have to buy a new model, or let the manufacturer’s in-house <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/thenational/complete-control-apple-accused-of-overpricing-restricting-device-repairs-1.4859099">repair teams charge $700</a> for a job that should&#39;ve cost $50. After all, if we’re going to survive climate change, we need to treat our tech more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-08-apple-battery-iphone-warning.html">sustainably</a> and keep as much as possible out of the landfill.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c2-e940-11eb-b14d-4d0d00cc95f5" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="4d77e598-a634-3cd1-8388-c6ab0d093a67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It says so much about how consumer technology has changed over the last two decades that Framework even exists. The idea that a repairable, modular laptop is somehow a radical proposition is outrageous given what lurks inside. And some corners of the tech world may think that users will need to put up with agricultural performance and looks in exchange for longevity. That’s why the best word I can use to describe Framework’s first, eponymous, machine is <em>uncontroversial</em>. The only time you’ll need to understand that this machine is repairable, is if it breaks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e9c61-e940-11eb-9d3f-57263f2cba67" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b46a62c5-47e9-36ae-9f0d-1ef30a9337aa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that Framework hasn’t invented the repairable laptop, or even the idea of modular expansion ports. The latter was common in laptops through to the late ‘00s and, even today, many enterprise laptops from the likes of HP and Lenovo have clear, detailed repair guides and easy-to-access spare parts. Framework isn’t claiming credit that it doesn’t deserve, but it is here, much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-plus-hands-on-090004841.html">Fairphone</a>, to show everyone that we shouldn’t tolerate the default.</p><p>There’s nothing spectacular, eye-catching or otherwise attention-seeking about the design of the first Framework laptop. Walk past it in a hurry and you’d be forgiven for mistaking it for any other 13-inch notebook made in the last half a decade. The aluminum body (made with up to 50 percent post-consumer recycled aluminum) makes it look like an old-school MacBook. From the front, it’s unmistakably a Windows laptop, but again, there are no steampunk flexes here. It’s only when you’re looking at it off-angle that you can tell something’s different.</p><h3>I/O</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2731-e940-11eb-b3ef-de2f3923b996" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="cb038618-09d2-3ff9-a873-0ddaa896604d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Rather than having ports stacked tight at the top of the mainboard, each side of Framework’s deck has two wide voids. Peer inside and you’ll see a USB-C port just visible buried deep in the machine’s guts. These voids are designed to house four “expansion cards” which can be swapped in depending on your need (so long as you press the release button on the bottom).</p><p>Each card offers a single port, connecting to the laptop over USB-C, and is designed to eliminate the need for a dedicated dongle. In the standard setup, you’ll get a quartet of USB-C cards — and you’ll need at least one for charging — but there are a number of others available. That includes options for USB-A, DisplayPort, HDMI and a microSD Card reader. You can also order an expansion card with additional external storage, with 250GB costing $69, and 1TB setting you back $149. Framework says that users can lobby for different cards in future, so all of those folks grousing for a full-size SD-card reader can get cracking.</p><p>Nestled between the ports is a small, white LED which lets you know when the machine is connected to power. Oh, and there’s a dedicated 3.5mm audio jack.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c1-e940-11eb-baf3-f6841a03021f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="b3b6e59e-f180-3b0c-b419-2709465e1c36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>My one complaint about the look of this thing is that the sides of the deck artificially taper in to make it look thinner than it really is. Because the base flares out underneath almost immediately, it looks a bit like it’s cheating. It would have been nicer if Framework had embraced the pleasant squareness of its design, rather than trying to disguise it.</p><p>In terms of build quality, the only thing to add is that the machine has a lot more flex than its contemporaries. This is, broadly speaking, the one benefit of these all-in-one, glue-heavy machines which are difficult to repair. The Framework, by comparison, squeaks and creaks when you twist the case, and you can see the dividing line between the keyboard and the rest of the deck as you do so.</p><h3><strong>Display</strong></h3><p>The 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display is lovely, and I feel like these days displays are so hard to mess up that there’s little more you can say about them. The backlight will push up to 400 nits, which is certainly the standard you’d expect from laptops in this class. Given that this machine is designed for productivity work you’re not going to come away with bleeding eyes if you stare at this for hours each day.</p><h3>Keyboard and Trackpad</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d05ac0-e940-11eb-ad9b-d6d7a343aa3f" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="c2aac9ca-63ca-379f-833f-4d25aee5b17a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework, from the outset, made it clear that it wanted to nail the fundamentals of what makes a good laptop. Naturally, a good keyboard is key, especially given how much time people will be spending on this thing each day. Here we’ve got an old-fashioned, uncontroversial chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and a soft (ish) landing. This was the standard for a good keyboard a decade ago, and little has changed, although the landing here is a little bit<em> too</em> soft. Clearly, this is a machine that won’t irritate other people when you’re typing on the train, but the quiet key presses come at the expense of some sharpness.</p><p>The trackpad, meanwhile, is similarly standard-issue, it’s a good size, with a satisfying click when you push it down and it’s reactive when you tap it. It couldn’t be much bigger given the size of the laptop’s deck, nor is it obtrusively placed. This is a satisfying thing to use, and I found myself defaulting to it rather than to my mouse, which almost never happens.</p><h3>Webcam and Audio</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd3-e940-11eb-bf4f-94c96dc9c062" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="dbe24dd1-00df-3258-8bd5-2b334bdeb321"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Framework laptop is equipped with a 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view, and it’s one of the best built-in webcams I’ve seen. Founder Nirav Patel told me that he had always intended to use a high-quality webcam, and felt vindicated by the pandemic. And either side of the webcam are hardware privacy switches to disable both the webcam and the microphone. These are “soft” switches that cut power to those components rather than physically obscuring the lens, and putting them on the top bezel is a strong flex, but not one I’m opposed to.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d48c37f0-e940-11eb-9f5e-e706411fb739" alt="ISNT HE SMOULDERING " data-uuid="8400f32d-c48e-3355-ac63-fa417b3ef3e0"><figcaption>Isn&#39;t he smouldering?</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I have fewer nice things to say about the side-firing 2W speakers that are broadly, generically, sort-of okay. The sound coming out of them is tinny, weak and muddy, with bass so weak that Budweiser seems strong in comparison. If you’re going to be using this as the center of your audio/visual world, then invest in a decent pair of speakers or headphones.</p><h2><strong>Performance and Battery Life</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c696c3-e940-11eb-9f7b-ef8ec241bd38" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="4c3e443a-fff9-3208-ab03-8073a17669f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The model that I’m testing is the $1,399 “Performance” model, which is packing Intel’s Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. All of the models, no matter the price, come with Intel’s Iris Xe graphics with no option for adding a discrete GPU. And certainly, in the week I used it, I don’t think I saw any lag or stuttering, and it handles undemanding games well enough. Benchmarks don’t tell the whole story, but in PC Mark 10’s standard score the machine averaged at 4927, outperforming a machine like the Surface Laptop 4.</p><p>As for battery life, I certainly didn’t find myself dashing for the nearest outlet while using this machine. In our standard rundown test, with display brightness set to 65 percent and an HD video looping, the Framework lasted 7 hours 46 minutes on its 55Wh battery. That’s enough to get you through a working day, but I would have vastly preferred it to crawl past that eight hour mark. A lot of machines in the 13-inch category can now get closer to 10 hours, and Intel’s Evo program insists upon it if your laptop has an HD-only display. The higher res screen probably offers Framework enough of a pass, but it’s something to bear in mind.</p><p>In terms of real-world performance, I spent about a week using Framework as my primary machine. Knocking around with Spotify open, several Chrome tabs and Slack all at once and I didn’t feel things dragging too much. A title like <em>Fortnite</em>, runs buttery-smooth on Medium settings and feels about right for this sort of work-first machine. Certainly, if you’re looking for a machine that can do work and (light) play, this will stand shoulder-to-shoulder with many ultrabooks in its class.</p><h2><strong>DIY</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/029e2730-e940-11eb-a3fb-a6620b2122ff" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2310a383-67c9-39fa-8e8b-417809582170"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Like the modular, repairable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fairphone-3-3-plus-repair-camera-swap-153053319.html">Fairphone</a>, Framework ships with a Torx T5 screwdriver in the box, and every screw uses that same head. Five screws are all that connect the top of the laptop’s deck, containing the fingerprint sensor, keyboard and trackpad, to the rest of the base. Pull that off, and you can then gently pry off the display bezel, which is attached to the screen with a series of magnets.</p><p>Once inside, you’ll spot that every component is labeled, with a QR code which links to friendly, iFixit-style repair guides. Construction isn’t vastly different from any other laptop, the company hasn’t left big pockets of space to aid repairability. In many ways, this is the best thing that this machine can do: Show consumers (and manufacturers) that making laptops easy to repair is very easy… if you try.</p><p>Framework shipped with its default US keyboard but, in a separate package, the company sent over a UK-format keyboard and top deck. I didn’t need to change it, and ordinarily I wouldn’t start disassembling a review laptop, but Framework said people should feel free to “poke around in the guts of the project.” So, with a sense of giddy empowerment, I thought I might as well swap units to see how easy, and safe, it was to swap the keyboards.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02d00ca0-e940-11eb-bfe6-54df372db068" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="38c017d9-cab2-3aec-aacf-e0d6b443c625"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Armed with my screwdriver and the documentation, I was able to unscrew the mounting bolts which hold the top deck to the rest. Once lifted off, I had to unplug one clearly labeled ribbon cable, pop the replacement keyboard back on and screw everything back together. This process took me three minutes and 54 seconds, which would have been half the time had I realized sooner that the screws were captive, and so were designed to be held inside the laptop’s body.</p><p>I have never felt more confident that I could repair this machine, and that this should be the default for all consumer laptops. Imagine, for instance, when a very famous laptop maker decided to use a different keyboard technology for its most popular machines. A keyboard technology that was found to be notoriously unreliable despite a number of revisions. Now imagine how many machines wouldn’t need to be sent back for repair, and the countless hours of working time lost to them, if it was this easy to replace the keyboard at home.</p><p>More crucially, if your laptop does get too slow for you to use, you can (with patience) swap out the mainboard, which houses the CPU (and, by extension, the integrated graphics). The idea being that in several years’ time, if your speakers, display, keyboard and everything else are working fine, why replace them. Unfortunately, buying this machine does require you to trust that the company will be around long enough to make good on that promise.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Price and the Competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd1-e940-11eb-be7c-34478b8923f6" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="8b9b39ad-f5c6-387b-ad08-404f9d76825e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Framework is releasing four versions of this machine, a $749 DIY edition which lets you choose a wide number of specs yourself, or provide your own. In the ready-to-use category, however, you have a $999 base model with a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. Then there’s the Performance model, which for $1,399 gets you a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD. Topping the chart is the $1,999 Professional edition, which has the same chip as this unit, but 32GB RAM and a 1TB SSD.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd0-e940-11eb-b3fd-d97cb4ee49b5" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="2328f502-2fcd-38df-a506-9e8f140345d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Given what Framework is offering here, it doesn’t make sense to just compare this machine to others at those $999, $1,399 and $1,999 price tiers. Instead, I checked <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/laptop-repairability">iFixit’s</a> chart of laptops which scored well on the repairability charts. One of the best performers was HP’s EliteBook 840 G7, which scored 9/10, and has a common screw format and easy to replace components. The 2021 version of that machine, the <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/hp-elitebook-840-g8-notebook-pc-p-360w8ut-aba-1">G8</a>, will set you back $1,879 for a 14-inch FHD display with a Core i7-1165G7, 16GB RAM and a 512GB SSD (or it would, but it’s out of stock).</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02c6bdd4-e940-11eb-bbff-160533111ae9" alt="Images of Framework&#39;s Modular Laptop" data-uuid="d81d5d36-000e-39b4-8892-c935a668967b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One problem with reviewing this machine is the desire not to bang on too much about The Context. We need to be able to judge this thing on its merits and, in that regard, it’s a pretty good laptop, certainly at this price and with this performance. What will motivate you to buy one, at least right now however, is the idea that you may be able to run this thing for years. If a component breaks that isn’t on the mainboard, you should be able to find a replacement. And you should be able to swap it in without any soldering or other such expertise. Many of the other parts are standard and easily removed, so when you need more RAM, a bigger SSD or faster WiFi, that should be an easy job. And, really, that’s what you’re paying for: The hope that you can use this device without complaint not just for the next few years, <a href="https://frame.work/">but maybe the next decade</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47d17f5b-e2ac-4042-8ad0-858394371dda</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 15:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626948920</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T10:15:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Framework Laptop Hero Image]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Framework Laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus Nord 2 5G makes another good argument for ignoring expensive smartphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="b3adeb64f17d4640816a5a2b08b58e90"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsUPH6G0nho" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>OnePlus has an unusual problem. It’s making very good flagship smartphones these days — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a> is an incredibly good phone — but at the same time, it’s still chasing its status as flagship phone killer.</p><p>The company’s Nord series was aimed at undercutting the expensive devices offered by the likes of Samsung, its Chinese rivals — or even Apple. Last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-nord-review-080107531.html">Nord</a> was the beginning of a new family of devices that attempted to still claim ‘flagship killer’ status, but at increasingly cheaper prices, including the debut Nord and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-143031687.html">$240 N200, which wasn’t all that great</a>. It was $240, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nord 2 5G costs more than that and is pretty similar to the original Nord in a lot of ways — including the fact that it’s not destined for the US. I’ve been testing the Nord 2 for a couple of days, and if you liked the proposition of the original Nord, you’ll probably like its sequel. The £399 (roughly $458 before tax) Nord 2 has a slightly more premium style that’s more similar to expensive relatives like the $729 OnePlus 9. While it might look the part, is it as good?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2a020-eae0-11eb-bfbf-8ae609d82c6f" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on" data-uuid="e8904c24-3a80-3e8e-ad41-12b764446b00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>I loved the vivid eye-catching sky blue of last year’s Nord, but its successor has a more restrained palette. OnePlus sent me the metallic blue option, which looks a lot like a OnePlus 9, augmented by the giant camera unit — even if it’s missing the Hasselblad label.</p><p>If you don’t like the restrained tones (there’s also a green and a gray option available depending on your region), OnePlus is also selling an aggressively wacky faux transparent case covered in white graffiti or a season-appropriate neon sunset case that’s already become my favorite.</p><p>When it comes to the cameras, there aren’t many upgrades. The rear module is now three cameras, not four, with a primary 50-megapixel (up from 48MP) sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS) responsible for the heavy lifting. While a two-megapixel difference might not seem like, well, anything worth noting, the new primary sensor has a bigger pixel size (1μm), up from the 0.8μm pixels on the original Nord, but still falling short of the 1.12μm pixels of the OP9 Pro.</p><p>There’s also an 8-megapixel 119.7-degree wide-angle lens and a mono sensor for focus assistance. When it comes to zoom, the Nord 2 5G offers up to 2x optical zoom, but thanks to the size of the main sensor, it’s pretty serviceable up to 5x. According to the spec sheet, you can crank it up to 10x digital zoom, but you know you probably shouldn’t.</p><p>From my brief shooting experience — and without the original Nord to hand — there doesn’t seem to be any major performance improvements. Perhaps predictably, the low-light shooting is what benefits most from the new sensor, given those bigger pixels. Otherwise, like the Nord, the Nord 2 5G can take some very pretty photos, capturing lots of detail. The AI mode, again, is a little heavy-handed at times, so I turned it off most of the time. Occasionally the phone would struggle with wide dynamic ranges, but this was while comparing the phone to the OnePlus 9 Pro and the iPhone 12 Pro — thousand-dollar smartphones.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/763e8360-eae9-11eb-9bfe-3eb123d9033e" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G camera sample" data-uuid="2638e73e-88ca-3252-9bc1-b30a6593e8d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>Video-wise, the Nord 2 can handle up to 4K at 30 fps, up to 60 fps at 1080p. It uses electronic image stabilization to amp up how much wobble it can handle, and video was pleasantly smooth — if the lighting was good enough. Video in low light suffered from a weird pulsing effect, that might be due to electronic image stabilization. Sadly, the footage was barely usable.</p><p>The biggest change when it comes to imaging might be the front-facing camera. While it’s OnePlus’ highest specification front sensor, capable of taking 32-megapixel pictures, it’s just a single camera sensor, compared to the dual-array on the original Nord. OnePlus has, however, added a built-in Group Shots 2.0 feature that can detect up to five faces, imagining a world of hanging out beyond COVID-19.</p><p>OnePlus also added a dual view video mode to shoot from both the rear and front-facing cameras at once, and there’s a NightScape Ultra mode for low-light shooting too, but nothing too thrilling.</p><p>The Nord 2’s 6.47-inch AMOLED screen has a 90Hz refresh rate which feels appropriately slick, while there are color and resolution boosting AI features that can be enabled during video playback in certain apps, including YouTube, VLC, Instagram (resolution boost only) and more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6db2080-eae0-11eb-99f9-9ef9e770803e" alt="OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on" data-uuid="53847af2-a3ca-38af-8f20-afd80b12b6ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith, Engadget</div></figure><p>The Nord 2 5G also marks a shift from Snapdragon processors from Qualcomm to Mediatek, with a chip apparently made especially for OnePlus. It’s called the MediaTek Dimensity 1200-AI, which, unsurprisingly, offers a degree of AI-centric muscle to processes like photo manipulation and the aforementioned video playback boosts. Compared to the original Nord, OnePlus claims this processor is 65% faster, while the GPU offers a 125% improvement on the original.</p><p>With limited time to test out the phone, so far, the processor feels, well, fine. I swiped and tapped through a handful of games including Alto’s Odyssey and Genshin Impact, the latter of which is a gorgeous game that can test even the most expensive flagships. It’s not the silkiest gaming experience, but Genshin Impact is an incredibly resource-intensive game that makes most phones sweat.</p><p>Performance-wise, does it beat a flagship phone, double (or triple) the price? God, no. But can it handle resource-intensive apps and tasks? Yes. I experienced some stutters on a few games that the Nord 2 shouldn’t really have struggled with, but no apps suddenly shut down. I’ve had a checkered past with phones powered by Mediatek chips, but I didn’t come across any performance issues here.</p><p>US readers might be frustrated that the Nord 2 5G won’t be coming to the US. Especially when OnePlus’ even cheaper phones  — which have hit US shores — have been too mediocre to recommend But there could be hope for future devices that land somewhere between basic smartphones eventually making it to the US</p><p>The Nord 2 is the first phone to be revealed since OnePlus announced it would be folding under Oppo in the future. For now, at least, this hasn’t resulted in any major changes for OnePlus phones. In fact, a OnePlus spokesperson told Engadget that the company was “keen to keep expanding in the US, and [the Oppo deal] gives us more resources to do it.”</p><p>The Nord 2 is a strong, if not quite perfect, mid-range phone. If OnePlus decides to make a Nord 3, perhaps it’ll nail the formula — or at least give it a chance to break America.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-2-5-g-impressions-release-date-price-144511154.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e64503a-4fdd-4714-88ff-d73656e59363</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:45:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626965480</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T14:51:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2c730-eae0-11eb-bfe3-c73cce194ce4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6f2c730-eae0-11eb-bfe3-c73cce194ce4" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith, Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus Nord 2 5G hands-on]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best study-from-home essentials for students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Engadget recommends a variety of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html">laptops</a> every year as part of our annual back-to-school guide. But that’s not quite enough if you want a productive study environment. Whether you’re a student staying home this year or you’re returning to campus, you’ll benefit from a few additional essentials. A laptop stand is useful for preventing neck and arm pain, while a lumbar pillow supports the lower back. A pair of noise-cancelling headphones does wonders for blocking out distractions and a LED lamp helps ease eye fatigue. From an external keyboard to a USB dock, we think all our suggestions below will lead to much-improved setup for those long study sessions.</p><h2>Soundance Laptop Stand</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3dd98f00-eaf4-11eb-a8ff-a52bfb06573b" alt="Soundance Laptop Stand

That’s why we strongly recommend getting a laptop stand. You can position your machine so that the screen is at the appropriate height. In general, you want your eye level to be one to two inches below the top of the display.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of our team’s favorites is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this one from Soundance" href="https://amzn.to/2U5uyWQ">this one from Soundance</a>, which can support laptops with 10- to 15-inch screens. It’s made from a sturdy aluminum alloy and the surface that holds the laptop is rubberized, which prevents it from sliding around. And, thanks to a series of detachable components, it’s also one of a few stands that’s easily portable. You can take it apart and put it together in minutes, making it great not just for your desk at home, but also for using it in the library.</p><p>The Soundance raises your laptop six inches above the desk, which should work well for most people. Also, the elevated design both facilitates better posture and helps ventilate your laptop. There’s even enough space underneath for you to store your keyboard and mouse when they’re not in use. If you want one with adjustable height, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rain Design iLevel 2" href="https://amzn.to/3gY4juy">Rain Design iLevel 2</a>. It’s not quite as portable and it’s more expensive than the Soundance, but it’s a good option if you need a stand with more flexibility.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Soundance laptop stand at Amazon - $24" href="https://amzn.to/2U5uyWQ">Buy Soundance laptop stand at Amazon - $24</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Rain Design iLevel 2 at Amazon - $47" href="https://amzn.to/3gY4juy">Buy Rain Design iLevel 2 at Amazon - $47</a></p><h2>Logitech K780 multi-device wireless keyboard</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7c57a2d0-eaf4-11eb-a3ff-08a5fcb85d0c" alt="Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard

(It’s not going to be comfortable typing on your laptop while it’s docked in the stand.) We recommend a wireless model so you don’t have to worry about cords cluttering up your desk. Logitech’s line of Bluetooth keyboards is an Engadget favorite, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:K780" href="https://amzn.to/3x2IGie">K780</a> is one of the brand’s most versatile models. It’s a full-size keyboard complete with a numpad, but it still feels slim and compact. The keys are responsive and comfortable as well, and you can pair it with up to three devices. There’s even an integrated cradle if you wish to use it with a smartphone or iPad.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Logitech K780 at Amazon - $59" href="https://amzn.to/3x2IGie">Buy Logitech K780 at Amazon - $59</a></p><h2>Logitech M525 wireless mouse</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9e3c16b0-eaf4-11eb-965d-c3720b5877b3" alt="Logitech M525 Wireless Mouse

It’s small enough that it won’t take up much space on your desk and It has an ambidextrous design that’ll fit both right and left-handed users. Its precision scroll wheel has a tilt function that allows for side-to-side scrolling as well. We should note, however, that this isn’t a Bluetooth mouse; you connect it to your computer via a USB receiver.</p><p>If you’d rather have the convenience of Bluetooth, consider the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MX Anywhere 3" href="https://amzn.to/3jkLe7p">MX Anywhere 3</a>. It has a 4,000-dpi Track Anywhere sensor that works on most surfaces, even glass.

You could get a chair with better back support, but those can be expensive. Plus, if you’re living in a dorm, you probably don’t have much choice in furniture anyway. The next best option is to get a lumbar support pillow. I personally recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Purple Back Cushion" href="https://amzn.to/35TPjYi">Purple Back Cushion</a> because it has a cushy grid that’s malleable enough to mold to the contour of my spine. One of the features that sets it apart from other cushions is that it has hundreds of air channels, which means you won’t get a sweaty back after sitting in a stuffy dorm room all day long. It comes with a washable cushion cover and an integrated strap that helps you attach it to most chairs.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Purple Back Cushion at Amazon - $39" href="https://amzn.to/35TPjYi">Buy Purple Back Cushion at Amazon - $39</a></p><h2>Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cb5d20d0-eaf4-11eb-9ed5-d267e8071c8f" alt="Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38" data-uuid="7065cf1e-0592-3bdc-98db-374f867e3a3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / Taotronics</div></figure><p>Another desk must-have is a lamp for those late-night study sessions. And if you’re going to spend money on one, it’s a good idea to get a lamp that can charge your devices at the same time. We’ve commended the Taotronics desk lamps in previous buying guides due to their multi-functionality, which is why we feel so confident recommending the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38" href="https://fave.co/3dhYCp1">Taotronics LED Desk Lamp 38</a> for most students.</p><p>The lamp has a built-in Qi-enabled wireless charger on its base that works with fast-charge compatible iPhone and Samsung devices up to 7.5W and 10W, respectively. Additionally, it has a USB port for charging other devices that aren’t Qi compatible. A multipurpose lamp is perfect for students who have a limited space and budget, plus the quick-charging base means you can quickly top up your battery in between classes. Of course, not having to deal with a charging cable while you’re studying is also a bonus.</p><p>The LED Desk Lamp 38 is also just a really excellent lamp, with five lighting modes and five brightness levels. You can use it on your nightstand too: It has a “night light” and a timer mode that automatically shuts off after an hour, which is helpful for those of us who like to read before bed.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Desk Lamp 38 at Taotronics - $56" href="https://fave.co/3dhYCp1">Buy Desk Lamp 38 at Taotronics - $56</a></p><h2>Sony WH-CH710N noise cancelling headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ec6b0ad0-eaf4-11eb-9dff-d3634feae27f" alt="Sony WH-CH710N Noise Cancelling Headphones" data-uuid="8f3e7bb7-575d-3e74-92ee-7e0acbcc50be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>A pair of noise-cancelling headphones is great for blocking out unwanted noise during study sessions, be it from annoying siblings or a raucous roommate.

Commerce Editor Valentina Palladino likes it because it has 10 ports, including USB-A, USB-C, Gigabit Ethernet and DisplayPort (or HDMI, depending on the model you choose), and it supports up to two 4K monitors with a single cable.</p><p>Our favorite part, though, is that it works with both Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C laptops, so if you’re not sure which you have, you don’t have to worry about it. You can also use it with the latest iPads, such as iPad Pros and the 4th-gen Air. Unlike smaller dongles, it’s not the most portable solution, but the Pro Dock makes up for that by giving you many more ports than your traditional adapter has — and it provides up to 94W of power to charge your device while it’s connected.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy USB-C Pro Dock at Amazon - $239" href="https://amzn.to/3dp9DVt">Buy USB-C Pro Dock at Amazon - $239</a></p><h2>24-inch ViewSonic VA2456-MHD monitor</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/296dc940-eaf5-11eb-bf6f-835ef5c21fe8" alt="24-inch ViewSonic VA2456-MHD monitor" data-uuid="f91a0052-1d27-325c-9a60-d2815789b7d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / ViewSonic</div></figure><p>Sometimes a laptop screen just isn’t big enough, and an external monitor is needed for you to do your best work.

Though we haven’t reviewed it, it’s highly-rated on Amazon and we’ve liked ViewSonic’s other monitors in the past so we know the company has a solid track record for quality. The VA2456-MHD has HDMI, DisplayPort and VGA connections, which makes it pretty versatile for a budget monitor. It also has 1080p resolution and an IPS panel for wide-angle viewing. Its three-sided frameless design is sleek too, an important quality for such a relatively large object. Lastly, it has a blue light filter to help minimize eye strain.</p><p>We should note however, that those looking for a color-accurate monitor might want to invest in something more powerful, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Dell&#x002019;s UltraSharp U2720Q" href="https://bit.ly/3igtEPR">Dell’s UltraSharp U2720Q</a>, but it is also considerably more expensive at nearly $700.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy 24-inch Viewsonic monitor at Amazon - $180" href="https://amzn.to/3jlPy6h">Buy 24-inch ViewSonic monitor at Amazon - $180</a></p><h2>Ironflask 24 oz Classic tumbler</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/58d3e160-eaf5-11eb-a7f6-bd7d8978925c" alt="Ironflask 24 oz Classic Tumbler" data-uuid="104a37d6-0573-3cce-b6ea-22ccdd41d327"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s important to stay hydrated even when you’re at your desk, which is why we like having a dedicated water vessel nearby.

Its double-walled, vacuum insulated construction can keep drinks cold for up to 16 hours and hot for up to four hours. That means you can use it for water as well as coffee or tea when you need a pick-me-up. It comes in a variety of colors, and it ships with two stainless straws, two plastic straws and straw cleaning brushes — so not only is the cup itself easy to clean, but you’re getting the tools to clean the straws, too. It also fits standard-size cup holders, which is great when you want to grab a drink on the go.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Ironflask Classic tumbler at Amazon - $23" href="https://amzn.to/3A2k3UV">Buy Ironflask Classic tumbler at Amazon - $23</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Nomad tumbler at Ironflask - $24" href="https://fave.co/3wT0zyZ">Buy Nomad tumbler at Ironflask - $24</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-study-from-home-essentials-120030014.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8681bcd-c545-30da-a9f3-6d06748525a0</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 14:30:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626964226</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T14:30:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[lovehome]]></category><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[anker]]></category><category><![CDATA[raindesign]]></category><category><![CDATA[pomofocus.io]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[standstand]]></category><category><![CDATA[amazonbasics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Logitech]]></category><category><![CDATA[TaoTronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Amazon]]></category><category><![CDATA[bts2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[clockworktomato]]></category><category><![CDATA[fully]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0ecdf2f0-eaf4-11eb-b27e-19fca4f363e0" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0ecdf2f0-eaf4-11eb-b27e-19fca4f363e0" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A collection of products from the Engadget 2021 Back to School gift guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Back to School - Study from home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify and Giphy are 'enhancing' GIFs with music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever seen a musician&#39;s GIF and heard the song in your head?

A new analysis of the security expenses racked up by Silicon Valley giants shows they collectively spent $46 million to safeguard their top brass last year. Of that figure, $23.4 million alone was spent on Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s personal security, up from $20.4 million in 2019, according to the report by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/ceo-security-pandemic"><em>Protocol</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company attributed the increase to new COVID-19 protocols and additional protection during the election. Included in the figure was a pre-tax allowance of $10 million and an additional $13.4 million for the Facebook founder&#39;s personal security. As a result, Zuckerberg far eclipsed others on the list including the world&#39;s richest person, Jeff Bezos, who paid $1.6 million in personal security costs. Signalling just how cautious Facebook is, the company&#39;s COO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/SherylSandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> was in second place with security worth $7.6 million in 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The results reflect the growing stature of the tech elite, who have grown more recognizable alongside the ballooning market caps of their companies, which provide globally popular services. Fame has inevitably brought with it unwarranted attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook, which has been accused of everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html">polarizing</a> public discourse to enabling the spread of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">vaccine misinformation</a>, has a right to be defensive. The company has previously noted in SEC filings that Zuckerberg is &quot;synonymous&quot; with the &quot;negative sentiment&quot; around it. In April, Facebook noted that its yearly assessments “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg.&quot; Other tech leaders have also borne the brunt of their notoriety. In 2020, it was revealed that Bezos&#39; phone had been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-guardian-jeff-bezos-whatsapp-hack-saudi-arabia-mbs.html">hacked</a> via WhatsApp two years prior, potentially by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>The security expenses list includes 11 individuals in total. In third place is Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai ($5.4 million in protection costs), followed by Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer ($2.06 million), Oracle&#39;s Larry Ellison ($1.71 million), Snap&#39;s Evan Spiegel ($1.67 million), Bezos, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff ($1.31 million), Uber&#39;s Dara Khosrowshahi ($849,000), Lyft CEO Logan Green ($599,000) and Apple&#39;s Tim Cook ($470,000).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-mark-zuckerberg-130242571.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1201b9f0-98b1-44f6-bab0-6c6c3d94368e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 13:02:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626958964</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:02:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eduardo Munoz / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Inc.

The pot itself has 11 built-in cooking programs, including sauté, pressure cook, steam, bake, broil and dehydrate. The bundle includes most things you&#39;ll need to try out all of those cooking modes, too, like a broil and dehydrate tray, multi-level air fry rack and more. Only the six-quart model is on sale (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:eight-quart" href="https://amzn.to/3BxqkbA">eight-quart</a> will set you back $200), but it&#39;s arguably the best size for most people as it can hold enough food for up to eight people.</p><p>The Duo Crisp is, admittedly, a more &quot;advanced&quot; Instant Pot than most.

It can take a kid from simple blinking lights to complex motion-controlled games. The snap-together baseboard can lie flat on a table like a regular breadboard, but it can also be folded into a cube or the pieces can be attached at a 90-degree angle. This gives kids an extra element to play with when they graduate to designing their own circuits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The kit itself only has a few pieces, but they’re quite flexible. And they’re all housed in large colorful plastic that should be easy for a kid to handle. There’s the usual electronics kid fare, like LEDs, a speaker, a potentiometer and two buttons. But there’s also a tilt switch, a light sensor and a microprocessor capable of handling some relatively robust tasks. The kit comes with instructions for 50 projects, but with the parts available a creative child could build quite a few more.</p><p>My one critique is that the jumper wires can be tough to insert and might require a bit of patience — something we know not every eight-year-old has an abundance of.<em>&nbsp;</em>—<em> Terrence O’Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50" href="https://amzn.to/3jhXCVH">Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50</a></p><h2>Playskool Shape Sorter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818b8ff0-df5a-11eb-9dbf-4a1e53e822fe" alt="Playskool Shape Sorter for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="194a562b-b7df-3fda-90b6-b61a11a059a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playskool </div></figure><p>A shape sorter is an awesome toy for younger kids because it encourages hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, problem-solving and even vocabulary (by identifying the names of shapes and colors).

The lid latches, which means they can’t just dump the shapes out easily; they have to learn how to work the mechanics of the lid as well. Also, the multi-colored shapes have tactile patterns on them that match the area of the box they’re supposed to fit into, and that gives me another teaching opportunity. The whole thing is durable, too — my son likes to chew on the shapes and my daughter likes to stand on the box, but despite that abuse, there’s not so much as a dent or a scratch on it. And because it’s only $9, it makes a great gift if you’re buying for someone else’s kiddo. —<em> Amber Bouman, Associate Editor, Parenting</em></p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Shape Sorter at Amazon - $10" href="https://amzn.to/3zSe2dh">Buy Shape Sorter at Amazon - $10</a></p><h2>Yoto Player</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818d8bc1-df5a-11eb-8edf-d3af5be54aaa" alt="Yoto Player for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="37456e4f-e217-37bd-b034-bcdf329d0d74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Yoto Player" href="https://amzn.to/3hNfCES">Yoto Player</a> is the perfect toy for a young child who wants to play their own tunes and stories, but who isn’t ready for an iPad or smart speaker of their own.

What’s not clear, right now, is how much of the game will be free, and how much will be paywalled behind DLC. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html"><strong>Continue Reading</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chromebook-chrome-os-login-issue-typo-142357563.html">Chromebook users were locked out of their laptops by a single typo.</a></h2><h3>It’s fixed now.</h3><p>Google had to pull a Chrome OS update that broke logins for Chromebook users, apparently due to a simple typo.

But, unlike its regular counterpart, deals on the cellular model have been few and far between. That all changed this month. The price of the untethered Apple Watch is currently at an all-time low for both sizes. Right now, you can purchase a 40mm cellular version in navy blue for $370 at Amazon, $129 below its normal price and at least $20 lower than the previous best deal.

That means you don&#39;t need a phone nearby, or a WiFi connection, to make or take calls, reply to messages, receive notifications, download apps and stream music.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, Apple has made a bunch of improvements to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">Series 6</a> over its predecessor. The latest Apple Watch features an S6 processor that the company claims is 20 percent faster than the Series 5&#39;s chipset. It also has a display that’s 2.5 times brighter, without any impact to battery life, which Apple says is actually longer. What&#39;s more, the charging speed has also been bolstered.</p><p>Alas, the fact that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">new</a> Apple Watch is likely just months away may influence your decision.

But, even in the face of criticism from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">White House</a>, a new report claims Facebook is still failing to delete even the most incendiary misinformation. As recently as last week, posts containing the hashtag #VaccinesKill were still active on the social network, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/08/tech/instagram-vaccine-misinformation/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only until the news publication warned the company of the lapse that it blocked the posts behind a message that read Facebook is &quot;keeping our community safe.&quot; To make matters worse, the same hashtag was banned by Facebook-owned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-instagram-blocking-anti-vaccine-hashtags.html">Instagram</a> almost two years prior. That action followed Facebook&#39;s pledge to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-facebook-instagram-anti-vaccine-content.html">crack down</a> on vaccine falsehoods, including bogus claims that they cause autism and other diseases, in the midst of a measles outbreak in New York.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This time round, the threat is even greater. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases of the Delta virus rising in the US, Facebook&#39;s latest slip-up will only draw more concern from policymakers. Just days ago, President Biden lambasted the company and other social networks by suggesting their failures were debilitating the vaccination drive. “They’re killing people,” Biden said.</p><p>In its defense, Facebook has previously noted that it&#39;s taking down more erroneous anti-vaccine information than ever before. In October, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-ads-discouraging-vaccines-165502226.html">banned ads</a> encouraging people to avoid getting vaccinated, following that with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html">wider clamp down</a> on anti-vaccine claims.&nbsp;</p><p>The company told <em>CNN </em>that it did not take action against the #VaccinesKill hashtag in the past as it did not meet its threshold. Facebook explained that it determines whether a hashtag violates its policies by looking at numerous factors, including the type and spread of content it is appearing in. &quot;Now, the #vaccineskill hashtag on Facebook violates our policies against misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines and we&#39;ve blocked it from search,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>At the same time, users are finding new ways to bypass the social network&#39;s misinformation rules. In May, some people began weaponizing Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">custom profile frames</a> to display false vaccine claims, forcing it to take them down.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-blocks-vaccines-kill-hashtag-094031580.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92297cb8-90d5-4062-87ea-ae6dda0138b4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:40:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626947123</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:45:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Emily Elconin / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nurses wait for people to come by to receive their coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at a mobile pop-up vaccination clinic hosted by the Detroit Health Department with the Detroit Public Schools Community District at East English Village Preparatory Academy in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 21, 2021.

As first reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a>, the DFEH sued the gaming giant after a two-year investigation wherein it came to the conclusion that the company discriminated against female employees. In addition to receiving smaller salaries than their male counterparts, female employees were also allegedly subjected to constant sexual harassment.</p><p>The DFEH enumerated several findings from its investigation in its <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/YJw">complaint</a> (PDF). Activision Blizzard&#39;s workforce is only about 20 percent women, and very few of them reach top roles in the company, the court document reads. Further, those who do reach higher roles earn less salary and total compensation than their male peers. Other female employees in non-executive roles are also paid less, promoted more slowly and terminated more quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DFEH also said that the defendant&#39;s &quot;frat boy&quot; culture is a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.&quot; Female employees constantly have to fend off unwanted sexual comments, the agency wrote. They have to endure being groped during &quot;cube crawls,&quot; in which male employees would drink alcohol as they make their way around various cubicles, as well. The document mentioned one particularly egregious case, in which a female employee took her own life during a business trip with a male supervisor who brought sex toys with him on the trip. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, that employee was severely harassed prior to her death, with her nude photos passed around during a company holiday party.</p><p>Activision Blizzard&#39;s HR department received a lot of harassment, discrimination and retaliation complaints, the DFEH said. However, the defendant allegedly failed to take &quot;effective remedial measures in response&quot; to them. Also, people were apparently discouraged from making complaints, since human resource personnel were known to be close to the alleged harassers.</p><p>The state agency has filed the lawsuit to force the video game titan to comply with California&#39;s workplace protections. It&#39;s also seeking unpaid wages and pay adjustments for female employees.</p><p>Activision Blizzard, however, denies DEFH&#39;s allegations. In a statement, the company said that the agency&#39;s lawsuit &quot;includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard&#39;s past.&quot; It called the DFEH&#39;s complaint &quot;inaccurate&quot; and described the lawsuit as the &quot;type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#39;s best businesses out of California.&quot;</p><p>The whole statement, courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-widespread-1847339746"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind. We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today. Over the past several years and continuing since the initial investigation started, we’ve made significant changes to address company culture and reflect more diversity within our leadership teams. We’ve updated our Code of Conduct to emphasize a strict non-retaliation focus, amplified internal programs and channels for employees to report violations, including the “ASK List” with a confidential integrity hotline, and introduced an Employee Relations team dedicated to investigating employee concerns. We have strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and combined our Employee Networks at a global level, to provide additional support. Employees must also undergo regular anti-harassment training and have done so for many years.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We put tremendous effort in creating fair and rewarding compensation packages and policies that reflect our culture and business, and we strive to pay all employees fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by non-discriminatory factors. For example, we reward and compensate employees based on their performance, and we conduct extensive anti-discrimination trainings including for those who are part of the compensation process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are confident in our ability to demonstrate our practices as an equal opportunity employer that fosters a supportive, diverse, and inclusive workplace for our people, and we are committed to continuing this effort in the years to come. It is a shame that the DFEH did not want to engage with us on what they thought they were seeing in their investigation.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34303078-143e-449d-a383-e2e9465cb573</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:03:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626944697</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:05:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/18: In this photo illustration, Activision Blizzard logo of a video game company is seen on a smartphone screen in front of Blizzard Entertainment logo.

That&#39;s part of the social network&#39;s latest experimental feature designed to give it more insight on what kind of replies users find relevant in a conversation. According to Twitter Support&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417957446367252493">announcement</a>, the goal is to be able to gather enough data, so the platform can work on ways to surface more relevant responses. In long threads, for instance, the best replies don&#39;t always show up immediately and might be buried underneath tons of other people&#39;s tweets.</p><p>The random testers who get the feature might see different versions of it. Some may see upvote and downvote buttons, while others might only see a downvote button right next to Twitter&#39;s heart/like option. A third version will show testers thumbs up and down buttons instead. The number of downvotes a reply gets will not be visible to the public, and users&#39; downvotes will be visible to them alone. Meanwhile, upvotes will show up as likes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3ce4a8609cc1458f9320a8ef458cca17"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some key notes about this experiment:<br><br>1.

As Twitter User Researcher Cody Elam explains in a series of tweets, the experiment&#39;s purpose isn&#39;t to shame users, but to give &quot;people the power to privately voice their opinion on the quality of replies&quot; and to give the company a &quot;more nuanced feedback.&quot; He added: &quot;We’re hoping to learn more about the quality of replies that people vote on and if voting is a feature that people find valuable.&quot;</p><div id="0a5336a805db4a6faeea3380fb0c2677"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In past research, we’ve learned which types of replies are considered best when reading conversations:<br><br>•Informative<br>•Supportive<br>•Positive<br>•Funny</p>— Cody Elam (@codyelam) <a href="https://twitter.com/codyelam/status/1417923996473905155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Twitter started testing the Reddit-like feature.
