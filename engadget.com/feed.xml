Instead, it’s programmed to work with concepts and has a set of “values” it turns to for guidance. It’s possible to shape the images it creates by providing it with additional instructions. Limit it to 30 or fewer brushstrokes and it will paint a more abstract piece. Conversely, with some 300 brushstrokes at its disposal, it will create something more realistic.</p><p>In its current iteration, the robot can work with both watercolors and acrylics and can mix paints with water.

It&#39;s IP67-rated, protecting it from dust and from being submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. Inside are two Class-H amplifiers, one mid-woofer and one tweeter, and the Roam supports adjustable EQ using the companion app. You&#39;ll be able to pair two Roam speakers together for stereo sound and connect the new speaker to existing Sonos devices you may have around your home.</p><p>But similarly to the Move, the Roam can play music via Bluetooth or WiFi and it supports a plethora of streaming apps including Spotify, Apple Music and others. You&#39;re also able to use Apple AirPlay 2 with it and control the device using either Amazon&#39;s Alexa or the Google Assistant. The Roam uses Sonos&#39; Automatic Trueplay tuning to adapt sound to your environment, and it&#39;ll be able to use the company&#39;s new Sound Swap feature. This lets you press and hold the play/pause button to swap the music to the closest Sonos speaker to you, making it easier to move sound with you from room to room.</p><p>When it comes to power, the Roam charges via USB-C or via any Qi-compatible wireless charging pad. The speaker comes with a charging cable, but Sonos will also sell a separate, wireless dock for $49.

It’s a follow-up of sorts to the Move, the company’s first portable speaker which debuted in 2019. That speaker may have Bluetooth and a battery, but its relatively large size and heavy weight meant it wasn’t exactly a grab-and-go device. The Roam, on the other hand, is made with portability first in mind, putting it in competition with speakers like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3rJ4Of3" target="_self">UE Boom 3</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbx2ko" target="_self">JBL Flip 5</a>.</p><p>My first impression of the Roam is that it’s a portable speaker first that can also be used at home. The Move, on the other hand, is a larger speaker built for the home that you can also take with you. It’s a subtle but important difference in how the Roam was conceived. <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html" target="_self">The $169 Roam</a> is a full-fledged Sonos device, which means when you’re home and connected to WiFi, it works just like any other Sonos speaker. You can group it with other Sonos devices; stream audio from dozens of services; take two Roams and pair them in stereo; use Google Assistant or Alexa for voice control; and stream from Apple devices using AirPlay 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8325e120-80f6-11eb-86bf-36e3e363721f" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="218e7d04-1210-3600-b2bc-a98c1202f5d0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>But like the Move, the Roam also has Bluetooth on board, which means you can pair a device and stream music to it when you’re away from a WiFi network. Its built-in battery is rated for 10 hours of playback, and it automatically goes into a low-power sleep mode when it’s not in use. It should last about 10 days in sleep mode.</p><p>Obviously, being able to link the Roam into a system of Sonos products is a plus for people already in the Sonos ecosystem, but it also has a lot of clever features that further separate it from other portables. For example, the Roam can automatically switch between Bluetooth and WiFi. Once you’ve paired it with your phone, it’ll remember that pairing and be set to go when you take it out of the home. Likewise, when you return it’ll rejoin your WiFi network without prompting. This is an improvement over the Move, which required manual switching between Bluetooth and WiFi.</p><section data-eng-breakout="beae9b3d00af40d498cae1071b28bfe2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/9d6c1b30-80f6-11eb-b9fb-a0ddd48d59e4" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="0839bc68-ac90-36fa-98cb-63f356b61730"></section><p>This speaks to the philosophy Sonos has for the Roam, which is making it simple to use both at and away from home. The Bluetooth-only speaker market is already pretty crowded,” Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, the company’s senior VP of hardware development,” said in an interview ahead of the company’s launch event. “For us, going into this specific market, we had to do more than just put Bluetooth and great sound into these products. We thought really hard about how to bring the Sonos experience from in the home to outside the home.”</p><p>That’s the inspiration behind things like the new “Sound Swap” feature. If you’re playing music on the Roam and want to bounce it to another Sonos speaker, pressing and holding the play button will search for the nearest speaker and send the music to it. The idea is to keep the music flowing from away from home into the home.</p><p>Sound Swap makes use of some intriguing technology. “Pressing and holding play/pause signals the other players to emit an ultra high frequency sound that only Roam can hear,&quot; Hadley Simmons, a product marketing manager at Sonos, explained to Engadget. “Roam can pick up those chirps with its microphones and detect the nearest speaker. It’s basically an easier way to move music throughout your home without having to go back to the Sonos app and sort through your different rooms.” In the same vein, if the Roam is playing music via Bluetooth, you can hold the play button and it’ll automatically stream that music to other Sonos speakers — effectively turning the Roam into a Bluetooth line-in to the rest of your system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/1538bf10-80f7-11eb-affd-772df6bfe86e" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="b64e72bb-d8a1-38da-b2b0-15fcc2f96dea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The technology for Sound Swap came out of the Sonos advanced technology group, a team that came together in the last few years. “In the past, we’d try and innovate in the product development process, but that’s the worst place to try and do it when you have a specific schedule and deadlines in front of you,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “So I created a special, standalone group that works on things for two, three, four years down the road.”</p><p>All these features are meaningless if people don’t want to take the Roam with them, which means its physical design is probably more important here than with standard home speakers. Based on what we’ve seen so far, the Roam looks compact and easy to move. It weighs less than a pound, and Sonos described it as about the same size as a water bottle. The idea is for it to be small and light enough that you don’t need to think about taking it with you; it just becomes a habit. I haven’t used it yet, but I could definitely imagine it being the kind of thing I’d toss in a bag when I leave the house, whether for a quick trip or a cross-country flight (when that’s doable, anyway).</p><p>As usual, there are some smart Sonos flourishes here. The speaker can be used in vertical or horizontal orientation. It detects which way it’s positioned and adjusts the sound accordingly. It’s compatible with all Qi wireless chargers, or you can simply use the included USB-C cable. Sonos is making its own magnetic wireless charger, but unfortunately it’s a $50 extra rather than something included in the box.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cfbb4980-80f6-11eb-bff9-ab189a68b42d" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="d4c92a9a-b41e-32e4-8354-dff56cdf7ee3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The Roam is also rated IP67 for dust and water resistance. In fact, it can be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and still work. The Move has superior resistance to temperature fluctuations, but it can’t be dunked in water. Given other companies have speakers that can even float in a pool, the fact that the Roam can survive a trip underwater is crucial.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Roam needs to sound good — no small feat, given its diminutive size. I haven’t listened to it, but. Simmons said users should expect sound quality comparable to the larger Sonos One speaker, albeit without the same max volume. But the bass presence is said to be much larger than you’d expect out of a speaker that small. Of course, we’ll need to wait to hear it for ourselves, but given what companies like Amazon, Google and Apple have done with their own relatively small speakers, I’m hopefully Sonos has worked its magic on the tiny Roam.</p><p>As usual for Sonos, the Roam features a number of custom internal components, like the so-called “racetrack” mid-woofer. Since a traditional circular design wouldn’t work in the slim, tall Roam, Sonos went with this oval shape to maximize its size. It also has a dedicated tweeter and two class-H amplifiers. Fitting both a tweeter and mid-woofer into the Roam rather than using one all-purpose driver should make a significant difference in audio quality.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d65cde60-80f7-11eb-b7f5-34f88a25170b" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="770d0e5a-280a-34ed-8ae7-6874cfa78ddb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>Sonos also included the “Auto Trueplay” speaker-tuning technology it first built into the Move. This means the speaker will use its built-in microphone array to listen to its output and optimize the sound for wherever it’s placed. Trueplay has been available for Sonos speakers since 2015, but they require an iOS device to use to manually tune the device. Not so for the Move and the Roam, and the Roam takes things a step further this time. It’ll be able to tune itself even when you’re not on WiFi, using profiles built directly into the speaker hardware itself.</p><p>The Roam is entering a crowded market, but it’s priced competitively, even if it’s still more expensive than many Bluetooth-only devices. It does offer a load of features if you’re already a Sonos user — but its low price also makes it a gateway drug to the Sonos ecosystem if you’ve never tried their products. We’ll need to take a listen before we can judge if Sonos hit the mark, but from what we know so far it’s looking like a compelling option in the ultraportable speaker category. Pre-orders for the Roam are open now on the Sonos website, and the speaker will be available on April 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-portable-bluetooth-wifi-speaker-specs-price-release-date-210042690.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">148da868-4e1a-4a10-ad25-910e70211e64</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615324672</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T21:18:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sonos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman lays on a blanket in the park, with a phone in one hand and the Sonos Roam speaker in the other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Roam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile will start automatically enrolling customers in an ad targeting program]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a T-Mobile subscriber, you’ll soon be automatically enrolled in a program that will see your online and device usage data sold to advertisers.

The new policy will include everyone who came over to T-Mobile through the carrier’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html" target="_self">2020 merger with Sprint</a>. That’s notable because Sprint previously allowed its customers to opt into sharing their data with advertisers.</p><p>T-Mobile’s decision to enroll as many of its customers as possible in a program that sells their data to advertisers runs counter to what we’ve seen from tech giants like Google and Apple recently. It was only earlier this month the former said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ads-user-data-tracking-cookies-144445173.html" target="_self">stop selling ads</a> that rely on a person’s browsing history, and not build any cross app tracking tools in the future.

It’s even a step beyond the data collection AT&amp;T and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) currently run. While both carriers automatically enroll their subscribers in programs that pool them into shared interest groups, as an AT&amp;T or Verizon customer, you don’t have to go out of your way to prevent your wireless provider from sharing more detailed information on you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can opt out of the advertising program by opening the T-Mobile app on your phone, tapping the “More” tab and then going into the “Advertising &amp; Analytics” section.

Players regularly compare the feeling to the first time they played <em>Minecraft</em>, marveling at the game’s scope, depth and atmosphere, and questioning how a team of just five developers managed to pack such an engrossing experience into a 1GB download. <em>Valheim</em> sets players loose in an original realm of Viking purgatory, a vast, procedurally generated world filled with mythical Norse beasts, high seas, hunting and crafting. It’s dense yet forgiving; action-packed yet peaceful.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To date, Iron Gate has sold more than 5.7 million copies of <em>Valheim</em>.

I will try to write a quick summary of this year’s happenings related to me and <em>Valheim</em>. It’s been an eventful year for sure. Crazy eventful to be honest. I have probably aged like 10 years this year. So here we go =). ...We quickly registered a new limited liability company and in the last minute I came up with the name Iron Gate! I like the idea that our logo is a gateway to other worlds. What lies beyond the iron gate?</p></blockquote><p>Truly, Svensson and Tornqvist had no idea.</p><p>“We did feel modestly confident in that we had a game that would see some success and provide the means for us to continue development through the Early Access-period, but nothing on the scale of the success we’ve actually had,” Tornqvist said. “It is a bit crazy actually, a once-in-a-lifetime hit, I think.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e569f1b0-8104-11eb-87f2-1501775fc25e" alt="Valheim" data-uuid="0507262c-72da-36f8-9ce6-c808e6407c87"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Iron Gate</div></figure><p>Tornqvist said he’s particularly enjoying all of the community-created content that’s spawned out of <em>Valheim</em>, including the memes, which he called “delicious.” Svensson and Tornqvist are hurrying to hire some more hands, and Iron Gate developers are focused on squashing bugs and continuing to support <em>Valheim</em> through Early Access, promising plenty of new content in 2021.</p><p>“Not to sound too corny, but we’re just very happy that so many people are enjoying the game really,” Tornqvist said. “So a big thank you to all the people who have taken the game to heart.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valheim-five-weeks-interview-steam-early-access-indie-184539795.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2d991d9-21aa-41c3-b7e8-d5b900f812d1</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:45:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615315543</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T01:59:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8c8327b0-8104-11eb-967d-d153066430d0" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8c8327b0-8104-11eb-967d-d153066430d0" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Iron Gate]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valheim]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valheim]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verzuz music battles are moving to Triller]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/triller-user-metrics-023248106.html" target="_self"><ins>Triller</ins></a> is beefing up its music credentials.

The company has made <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/soundsport-wireless.html#v=soundsport_wireless_citron" target="_self">a number</a> of them over the years, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/bose/soundsport-free/" target="_self">multiple</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-bose-sport-earbuds-announced-price-specs-134749642.html" target="_self">pairs</a> of true wireless buds. However, for its most recent option, Bose is taking a different approach. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-officially-unveils-its-wireless-sport-open-earbuds-144019656.html" target="_self">The Sport Open Earbuds</a> (<a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/sport-open-earbuds.html#v=sport_open_earbuds_black" target="_self">$199.95</a>) are indeed true wireless, but they don’t have the typical ear tip that goes inside your ear canal.</p><p>Instead, as the name suggests, they have an “open” design that sits outside of your ear. Not only does this increase comfort, but it also allows you to hear what’s going on around you at all times — a key safety feature for runners. Add a sporty over-the-ear hook design and water resistance and you’ve got earbuds prepped for the gym or trail. The only question is whether you’re willing to make some sacrifices for the sake of staying in tune with your surroundings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="7f1714f6-6862-4abb-a361-2f9c53977832"/><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>Like a lot of sports buds, both wired and wireless, the Bose Sport Open Earbuds have a hook that goes over the top of your ear and down behind it. This, of course, keeps them in place while you’re moving around on a run or in the gym. And that’s even more essential with these since there’s nothing going inside your ear that would otherwise keep them from falling out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/435f47c0-80f6-11eb-bf39-03dd7d3bcd9b" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds. The company keeps your ears open to your environment while you exercise, which can increase safety for runners and other workout situations. At home, you won&#x002019;t seem like a jerk for not answering your partner while listening to a podcast. However, the design that makes the Sport Open Earbuds compelling for workouts limits performance elsewhere, so you have to accept sacrifices that could be deal breakers. " data-uuid="14f74d16-3090-3246-b782-6908de1d1eeb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The hook design keeps things stationary, but they’re made of hard plastic. They don’t offer as much comfort as a soft-touch or flexible material would. Plus, they don’t bend to adjust to the contours of your ears. You’re stuck with the exact shape Bose’s designers selected, which isn’t uncomfortable per se, but it also isn’t as comfy as it could be.</p><p>Due to the Sport Open Earbuds design, the actual “earbud” component sits at the top of your ear rather than just outside of your canal. This allows for the “open” design that keeps your ears free to hear what’s going on around you while you listen to music or podcasts. Bose has created what it calls OpenAudio technology that beams “rich, full-range sound” into your ears while reducing what others nearby might pick up. It’s a similar concept to the Bose Frames, though these earbuds position the sound source much closer to your ear. So instead of using bone conduction, the Sport Open Earbuds employ specifically placed acoustic ports that channel music to its intended destination, powered by two 16mm drivers. It sounds good on paper, but in practice, my family could easily hear noise from these even at medium volumes.</p><p>Samsung’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html" target="_self">Galaxy Buds Live</a>, also offers an “open” type design. But with those, Samsung puts the speaker directly over your ear canal. So while there’s no ear tip inside your ear, the buds are much closer, which helps with noise isolation and overall sound quality.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/be4bd3d0-80f7-11eb-bf5f-63edb0525c40" alt="Bose Sport Open Earbuds" data-uuid="7055d0ca-4533-3c3e-996f-cdb7eeff72b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>Lastly, Bose didn’t totally nix on-board controls for the Sport Open Earbuds. There are two tiny physical buttons — one on each side — that offer a few options. On the right, a single press will play/pause, a double press will skip to the next track and a triple press will return to the previous track. That same button is used to power on the earbuds and answer/end calls. The control on the left earbud activates your voice assistant of choice when you hold it down, and you can set it to announce the battery level with a single press. Thanks to a post-launch update, you can adjust volume with a tap on the outside of the earbuds. Use the right to increase volume and the left to turn it down. Bose also gives you the ability to disable volume control entirely inside of its app (it’s disabled by default).</p><p>It’s interesting that Bose employs both a physical button and touch gestures for the on-board controls on these earbuds. The tap is the less invasive action, so it would be great if the company could make some of button-pressing items touch enabled. At any rate, it’s clear Bose plans to improve the experience over time, since it’s already doing so shortly after launching the product.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/435adaf1-80f6-11eb-a6f2-375d80f64d11" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds. The company keeps your ears open to your environment while you exercise, which can increase safety for runners and other workout situations. At home, you won&#x002019;t seem like a jerk for not answering your partner while listening to a podcast. However, the design that makes the Sport Open Earbuds compelling for workouts limits performance elsewhere, so you have to accept sacrifices that could be deal breakers. " data-uuid="13680e39-1325-33ca-8244-a4adc7406492"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Going into this review, I had flashbacks to testing the Galaxy Buds Live. Samsung’s design choices were pretty unique and those earbuds accomplished a lot of what it set out to do. However, the audio quality just wasn’t there. Plus, the company included active noise cancellation (ANC) on a product that didn’t seal off your ears, which kind of defeated the purpose. My first experience with a set of “open” design earbuds showed me having your ears always tuned into what’s going on around you meant big sacrifices in audio quality.</p><p>That’s the case again with the Bose Sport Open Earbuds. Bose has achieved a lot of what it intended: primarily, keeping your ears unobstructed when you’re exercising. There’s no denying this has massive implications for safety, especially for runners. But, I could overhear plenty at home while testing these. And, if your gym is anything like the one I went to pre-pandemic, it blasts a variety of pop music at an unreasonable volume. The main reason I wore headphones was to block that out, and these Bose earbuds won’t help you much there. You also have to be aware that these aren’t going to give you the audio quality you’ll likely be looking for in a set of $200 earbuds. That’s especially true when it comes to low-end.</p><p>While the Sport Open Earbuds have decent clarity, the lack of bassy thump sucks a lot of energy out of songs that are otherwise big and boomy. And if you’re like me, you rely on an ample amount of low-end to keep you motivated during a workout. With these earbuds, you get plenty of treble and some mid-range but that’s about it. This means they’re great for podcasts but just okay for most genres of music.</p><section data-eng-breakout="25c5cc377031406397aac944d9afa7a3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/6133d150-80f9-11eb-bf6f-98130e92cea6" alt="Bose Sport Open earbuds" data-uuid="27b79b4e-779c-34a3-a239-40e921674947"></section><p>For example, the drum machines and percussion on Com Truise’s synth-heavy instrumentals retain detail, but the songs just don’t have the depth and droning bass lines that make them so atmospheric. The discrepancy is even more noticeable with hip-hop tracks like Lil Baby’s “Heatin Up.” The beat that’s the backbone of the track fades into the background.</p><p>The open design also has a benefit for calls: you can chat without feeling like you have to yell to hear yourself. Like podcasts, call audio comes through the earbuds crisp and clear. However, the person on the other side noted I sounded only slightly better than a speakerphone and background noise was an issue. They also said that they could hear themselves coming through — likely because the earbud mics were picking up sound from the open speakers.</p><h2><strong>Software features</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/43597b61-80f6-11eb-85c1-a8fbe3de5839" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="0749f65a-1e33-310c-8193-5bf8c1cdbbc7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>A lot of headphone companies offer the ability to use audio presets, manually tweak the EQ or customize on-board controls with an app. That’s not an option Bose gives you with the Sport Open Earbuds. Instead, the app primarily handles software updates and monitors battery levels. There is one handy item in relation to charging: the app knows when the earbuds are on the base and displays progress.</p><p>Like most earbud and headphone apps, it also reminds you what the controls do, but that’s really it. It’s clear Bose wanted to keep things simple here, but that comes at the expense of literally any degree of customization.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Bose claims up to eight hours of battery life on the Sport Open Earbuds. During my tests, I actually managed slightly better, stretching them about 30 minutes longer than the stated figure. This listening time is slightly above average for true wireless earbuds these days, but there’s a catch: these buds don’t come with a charging case. You don’t have a place to constantly top off the battery in your pocket when you’re taking a break from tunes. It also means there are separate accessories for charging and for storage.</p><p>Bose includes a magnetic charging base with a USB cable that connects to either your computer or a plug you likely already have. The Sport Open Earbuds fully charge in two hours, and 30 minutes will give you three hours of playback. Lights on the outside of the earbuds pulse white during charging and remain solid when done. The company also put a hard shell carrying case in the box. It’s not the fanciest thing, but it gets the job done. And a magnetic closure should keep them from falling out if the case gets jostled around in your bag.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><section data-eng-breakout="a39844ab1ff045dd8fa61703666e526d" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/664fdf00-80f7-11eb-bbfe-2623c5b8e2fd" alt="Bose Frames" data-uuid="ae369f4e-d894-3f53-885a-3bfa13b337be"></section><p>Bose actually offers some solid competition for the Sport Open Earbuds within its own product lines. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-bose-sport-earbuds-announced-price-specs-134749642.html" target="_self">The Bose Sport Earbuds</a> are a more traditional true wireless product, with ear tips and fit wings to keep things in place and block out noise. They lack the company’s powerful ANC and they’re quite big, but the sound quality is solid and they’re cheaper at $179.95.</p><p>As I mentioned, if you’re a fan of the “open” wear style, Bose also offers it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html" target="_self">with sunglasses</a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-three-new-frames-131152809.html" target="_self">The Bose Frames Tempo</a> are specially designed for exercise and sports, though the company does have options for “regular” use. The sport model offers eight hours of battery life and better water resistance, but they’re also one of the priciest options at $249.95 (some models are $50 cheaper). All of the audio sunglasses have swappable lenses, some are even prescription friendly, and they keep your ears tuned in to what’s going on around you.</p><p>For non-Bose alternatives, I’d actually suggest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html" target="_self">the Galaxy Buds Live</a> from Samsung. Like the Sport Open Earbuds, these don’t have an ear tip and sit outside of your ear canal. However, they’re positioned <em>just </em>at the outside of the opening, rather than above it. This ensures better sound quality while still keeping things comfy and allowing ambient noise through. I’m not a big fan of them overall, but if a set of “open” earbuds are what you’re after, they’re worth a look. As of this writing, they’re $130 on Amazon (regularly $170).</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4359f091-80f6-11eb-bfbe-53a078ec1319" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds.

The company may be mostly known for its noise-cancelling chops, but overall audio quality has also been respectable. With the Sport Open Earbuds, Bose decided allowing you to be hyper aware of everything around you was paramount. This means you gain the comfort of not having something crammed in your ears, but you have to accept sacrifices to sound quality.</p><p>I can appreciate these earbuds have a very specific purpose, and they could be a solid compliment to a set of over-ear noise-cancelling headphones that allow you to tune in and tune out the world. Of course, that’s the wrinkle: Do you want to invest in two sets of headphones or earbuds? There are plenty of all-around options that are well-suited for both casual listening and exercise. You’ll just have to decide if keeping your ears open is more important than great sound quality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bose-sport-open-earbuds-review-180058380.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a727045-80ba-42bb-9d27-bf42bfaebcda</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615313251</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T18:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d8aac600-80f7-11eb-b37e-4cd2d54b4a5f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d8aac600-80f7-11eb-b37e-4cd2d54b4a5f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bose Sport Open Earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bose Sport Open Earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome OS is getting a big redesign for its 10th birthday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the 10th birthday of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html" target="_self">Chrome OS</a>, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-turns-10-new-features" target="_self">announcing a revamp today</a> and a new set of tools to make the platform much more useful. Of note, it&#39;s adding a new clipboard that remembers the last five things you copied, a Phone Hub to make accessing your Android device easier and support for Nearby Share.</p><p>Phone Hub is a little dashboard that lets you access your phone&#39;s controls and see its status for things like battery life and data connectivity. Not only can you use your Chromebook to ring your Android device when you&#39;ve misplaced it, you can also enable tethering with one click as well as see recent Chrome tabs on your phone. You&#39;ll continue to be able to send and receive texts from the laptop (which you could already do before with the Messages app).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Two new features make life a bit easier for those who have Android and Chrome OS devices. First, WiFi sync will let you automatically connect to trusted networks that you&#39;ve used on your phone or other Chromebooks without having to re-enter passwords. And in the coming months, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-nearby-share-specs-availability-160054637.html" target="_self">Nearby Share</a> is coming to enable file sharing between your Chromebook and other Chrome OS or Android devices without an internet connection (over Bluetooth or local WiFi).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/2ae373d0-80fe-11eb-a7fd-56046061091e" style="height:1024;width:1344;" alt="Chrome OS 10th birthday update images Phone Hub" data-uuid="22741cdf-ffb5-3f67-9c95-2f4a1ccc5bdd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google is also boosting the screen capture tool in Chrome OS, making it easier to access from the Quick Settings panel. You can now outline exactly what you want to copy on your display, and create screen recording videos, which will all be saved to your clipboard. Speaking of, the clipboard can now store up to five things you&#39;ve copied, and you can access them from the new Tote feature. This is a holding zone for all the files you and Google think you&#39;ll need, in addition to the screen captures. You can pin files to Totes for easy access, which should come in handy for things your frequently send like checklists or reference sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the redesign, Google is integrating media controls directly into the Quick Settings panel for easier access and refreshing the icons for built-in apps. Sharing files, images and links between apps and your browser is becoming slightly easier — now when you click Share on supported websites, you&#39;ll see a list of apps you can send your content to directly.

Paxton was using the &quot;full weight&quot; of his position as retaliation over editorial choices he didn&#39;t like, Twitter&#39;s attorneys said.</p><p>Paxton himself had claimed Twitter&#39;s ban &quot;chills free speech&quot; and accused multiple tech giants of a &quot;seemingly coordinated deplatforming&quot; of Trump following the Capitol riot. He echoed frequent conservative beliefs that Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html" target="_self">Facebook</a>, Google and others are breaking the spirit of the First Amendment with an alleged bias against right-wing views. These sites should be treated as public spaces and forced to carry any otherwise legal content, according to these beliefs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter may have a solid case, however. As a private company, Twitter is within its rights to determine what it does and doesn&#39;t publish. It might also point to a long history of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-twitter-trump-suspensions-173002449.html" target="_self">refusing to ban Trump</a> despite repeated violations of its policies, instead <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-twitter-label-tweets-breaking-rules-politicians-public-interest.html" target="_self">relying on labels</a> or limitations on specific tweets. This wasn&#39;t a company that rushed to ban a dissenting view, in other words.</p><p>Paxton&#39;s office hadn&#39;t formally commented as we wrote this, but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if he fought hard to protect the investigation. It could rally political supporters at a time when Paxton himself is facing scandals, such as <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-sues-texas-ag-ken-paxton-claiming-he-retaliated-after-it-banned-trump/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=112970055" target="_self">accusations</a> of bribery and abuse of office. A successful probe could also lead to punitive actions against Twitter, such as fines or an order to reinstate Trump&#39;s account.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-sues-texas-attorney-general-163927907.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">223524fe-1b72-47e3-b791-ae7d0ee96dfe</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 16:39:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615307976</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T16:39:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e872b1c0-80ec-11eb-bbd7-09aeaf454f19" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e872b1c0-80ec-11eb-bbd7-09aeaf454f19" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Raedle via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ORLANDO, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 27:  Ken Paxton, Texas Attorney General, speaks during a panel discussion about the Devaluing of American Citizenship during the Conservative Political Action Conference held in the Hyatt Regency on February 27, 2021 in Orlando, Florida.

The initial result of that massive investment has now hit the streets in the form of a compact crossover SUV. Say hello to the 2021 ID.4, VW’s first EV for the people.</p><p>The ID.4’s on-paper stats aren’t particularly striking, especially when compared to some of its higher-priced, luxury alternatives. With a 77.0-kWh lithium-ion battery pack putting out 201 HP and 229 pound-feet of torque, the ID.4’s specs are very much in line with its gas model equivalents like the Honda CRV or similarly specced EVs like the Hyundai Kona or Kia Niro EV (though each of those only have 64 kwH batteries).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ID.4 tips scales at 4,600-plus pounds. Yeah, that’s stout, even for an electric and it’s roughly 800 pounds heavier than the biggest 2021 Kona EV. As such, you shouldn’t be surprised that the EV crossover takes its sweet time getting up to 60 mph in around seven and a half seconds, which is pretty pokey for an EV. Even when overtaking other vehicles at freeway speeds, the ID.4 can feel downright lackadaisical. Combined with a governed top speed of 100 MPH, the ID.4 is very much a people mover, not a sports car in disguise.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/5d3899c0-80f7-11eb-827b-cc98bd33e4c9" alt="A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships." data-uuid="b2c95689-5c3d-33a9-85a9-b787c2d80c09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>Its EPA estimated 250-mile range feels generous and seems very much geared towards urban errands and freeway commutes with ready access to charging stations. Even when using the electron-sipping Economy mode to cruise along a nearly empty Highway 280 outside San Francisco, the power gauge shrank far more quickly than I was comfortable with. This was the first EV I’ve test driven where I’ve felt a bit of palpable range anxiety. Thankfully, the ID.4’s 400V electrical architecture supports both level 2 and DC fast charging protocols which enable it to imbibe an 80 percent charge in, respectively, around 9.5 hours and just under 40 minutes (per VW’s estimates).</p><p>Style-wise, I find myself smitten with the ID.4. The crossover’s exterior is less windswept than last year’s Honda HRV but not as rigidly straight-edged as Volvo’s upcoming C40 Recharge. And unlike what we saw on the Mach-E, e-tron GT or even the XC40 Recharge, the ID.4 appears to use surprisingly muted head and tail lights — you won’t find any Thor’s Hammers bedazzling the hood or distended brakelights climbing the trunk lid like LED ivy. Kind of a shame, really.</p><p>The interior is sparse. But, I guess, no more sparse than any of the other last few EVs I’ve recently been in? Honestly, They all feel sterile and minimalist to me, if only to varying degrees. In this case, the dashboard of the ID.4 comprises two LED displays, a smattering of steering column stalks and some AC vents.</p><p>The gear shift is located on the steering column as well and it’s weird  — basically a wide paddle mounted on the column and capped with a parking brake button. You twist it back and forth to change between forward and reverse gears. I mean, I wasn’t initially a fan of the Mach-E’s cylindrical iDrive-style shifter but at least it didn’t take me 5 minutes just to identify the damn thing the first time I got into the car. Same with the Start button. I haven&#39;t thought to look for a start button on the steering column itself since the days of physical ignition cylinders. Touche, Volkswagen.</p><p>Despite the confusing nature of various sticks, stalks and buttons, the cabin itself is really quite comfortable. It’s roomy enough for five grown adults to fit in without having to slouch in the back seat, plus the perceived headroom and vertical space is accentuated by an all-glass roof. Unlike the Mach-E, the ID.4’s roof is much less opaque and is instead concealed from external prying eyes by a rollaway cloth headliner which slides out of the way at the swipe of an overhead touch control. The trunk space is equally well appointed with 30 cubic feet of space that more than doubles if you lower the rear seat backs.</p><p>The infotainment system, however, is like if 2020 were digital cabin controls. I’ve yet to encounter such a system with a steeper initial learning curve. The menu system feels like it was designed via dare. Upon taking delivery of the vehicle I was auditorily assaulted with adult contemporary music for an unconscionable span of time while I tried in vain to locate a power button, a pause button — hell, even the volume controls — in what proved to be VW’s byzantine infotainment menu system. And for that I will never forgive you, Michael Bolton. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID, MICHAEL.</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFood_bTOX4?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Thank goodness for a robust voice control system combined with integration for both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to enable more seamless control of the cabin environment. But note that these aren’t fully integrated like what you’d see on the XC40 Recharge or the Polestar 2 with Android Auto — those operate directly through the infotainment system head unit.</p><p>The ID.4 does bear a passing resemblance to the Tesla Model Y, and I like that, it’s just tall enough to provide a clear view of the traffic around me without feeling top-heavy — the thousand pounds of battery pack under my seat certainly helps with that. The suspension is strung tightly enough to keep the ID.4 from body-rolling through turns while remaining soft enough that driving over potholes wouldn’t jar my spine out of alignment.</p><p>Oddly, I could seem to find a one-pedal driving option. One-pedal driving is a system found in EVs that uses the accelerator pedal to modulate both the vehicle’s drive and braking — press down on the pedal to go faster, ease off it to automatically engage the regenerative brakes and recoup precious charge. I personally am not a fan of the method but its absence from a vehicle so clearly designed as a practical family commuter is both noticeable and notable.</p><p>The ID.4’s ADAS system, IQ.DRIVE, works generally as you’d expect it would. It offers the standard mix of forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, rear traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control. In my limited experience with it, I found the lane keeping feature demanded an iron will to engage as the vehicle kept seeming to delay recentering itself within the lane until it was already riding the side marker. It’s certainly no hands-free steering like what GM’s SuperCruise feature offers, but this is helpful when you&#39;re in traffic and trying to fight through infotainment menus.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/5d44cec0-80f7-11eb-ac8a-b7d9ba2977c6" alt="A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships." data-uuid="9ed885c6-f9a5-3cda-a4ee-9dc42dc43806"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>The ID.4 starts at around $40,000 and comes available in three trim packages, the Pro, the Pro S and the 1st edition. All three are currently only available as RWD though the Pro and Pro S will begin offering an AWD version later this year as a $4,000 option. Specifically, the 1st Edition, which I drove, starts at $43,995, the Pro will put you back $40-44,000 depending on drive type and the Pro S (the S stands for Statement) will start at $44-48K with the option to upgrade to 19-inch rims and a 12-inch infotainment display for an added $1,500.</p><p>Overall, the ID.4 is a solid first attempt at an EV. Sure Volkswagen included a few… ahem, unusual design decisions, it’s range and power consumption were twitchy enough to keep my eyes glued to the battery gauge during my drive, and the whole vehicle in general felt just a touch under-powered. But this is the first of what we expect will be many more EV models from the automaker. I’d personally wait a model year or two for everything to fully shakedown and for VW to work all the bugs out but if you’re in the market for a sensible mass-market EV that can shuttle your family around town, carry home a full load of groceries, and perform all those other innocuous errands that used to fill our days before the pandemic hit, the 2021 ID.4 is well worth your consideration.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83a896ad-d8c1-4506-8100-78d8f1e528cc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 16:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615308859</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T16:54:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/ed759bb0-80f6-11eb-9ded-9ae2b6117e22" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/ed759bb0-80f6-11eb-9ded-9ae2b6117e22" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Volkswagen ID.4 EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Alexa-enabled smart ring light from GE is on sale for 55 percent off]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As impressive as Amazon’s Alexa technology is, the best way to utilize it isn’t always clear.

Through March 13, you can get 35 percent off <a href="https://amzn.to/2Oz48di" target="_self"><em>Super Mario Party</em></a><em>,  </em><a href="https://amzn.to/3eoTXD0" target="_self"><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion 3</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://amzn.to/2OjF6Pv" target="_self"><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em></a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/2OFGLyD" target="_self"><em>Mario Tennis Aces</em></a> at <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/sales-and-deals/" target="_self">Nintendo&#39;s eShop</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/3bsy43F" target="_self">Amazon</a>. That discount brings all of those titles down to just under $39, which is an all-time low for some of them. Those are the games Nintendo&#39;s highlighting for Mar10 Day, but a number of other Mario games are on sale at Amazon including <a href="https://amzn.to/30uQn1O" target="_self"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a> for $39, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ryyKKx" target="_self"><em>Super Mario Bros.

Nintendo&#39;s pulling the collection from physical and digital shelves on March 31. We doubt it&#39;ll see a huge price drop before the cut-off date, so if you want it, you have only a few more weeks to get it.</p><p>Those are the best deals happening for Mar10 Day this year, but Nintendo&#39;s also celebrating with special in-game extras throughout the month.

The on-screen controls worked surprisingly well and all of the complexity that the MOBA is known for is still there. Currently, there are 50 playable champions to master, each with their own selection of skills, and item builds are still a major part of the experience. All of that can make the game overwhelming if you&#39;ve never played LoL before, but thankfully <em>Wild Rift </em>comes with a handful of tutorials that explain all the basics.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/league-of-legends-wild-rift-north-america-march-29-150017585.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">59e4daa1-b642-4531-b47d-9cde8948e003</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 15:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615244240</ingested><modified>2021-03-08T22:57:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cd0be790-805f-11eb-bf9b-8d9334c05ab4" width="1800" height="1158" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cd0be790-805f-11eb-bf9b-8d9334c05ab4" width="1800" height="1158" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[League of Legends: Wild Rift]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[League of Legends: Wild Rift]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's 980 NVMe SSD boasts high performance with a tradeoff]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/all-memory-storage/?key_category_features=NVMe" target="_self">Samsung</a> has finally introduced a 980 SSD that isn&#39;t part of the high-priced Pro line, and it&#39;s mostly good news for performance-minded PC users — with a caveat. The company&#39;s new base level 980 NVMe drive is billed as a significant upgrade over the long-serving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-24-samsung-970-evo-and-pro-ssds.html" target="_self">970 Evo</a> with similar sequential read speeds (up to 3,500MB/s), but faster writes (up to 3,000MB/s versus 2,500MB/s), and more sustained performance through a larger buffer. It even promises 36 percent lower power consumption, 54 percent greater power efficiency and improved cooling that should prevent overheating. It may be a better fit for laptops as a result.</p><p>However, Samsung is also ditching built-in DRAM on the plain 980, joining the ranks of lower-cost SSDs. It&#39;s promising speeds &quot;identical&quot; to faster DRAM-equipped drives in part by using Host Memory Buffer technology to directly access system RAM, but it&#39;s clear this is a tradeoff to keep prices down and compete with lower-end SSDs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those prices are low, thankfully. Samsung is selling the 980 starting at $50 for a 250GB model, $70 for 500GB and $130 for 1TB (there&#39;s no 2TB edition, at least not yet). That compares favorably to Samsung&#39;s current prices for the 970 Evo line, where a 500GB model normally costs $80 and a 1TB drive will cost you $160. It&#39;s certainly lower than the 970 Evo&#39;s launch-era prices, when even the 250GB drive started at $120. The 980 may be worthwhile for the price, then, even if it&#39;s not the uniform upgrade you might have hoped for.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-980-nvme-ssd-150012298.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41cc12ed-0690-47bc-b091-924517600eb2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 15:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1614609434</ingested><modified>2021-03-01T14:37:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/b13410e0-7a94-11eb-ad7e-7803c951c607" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/b13410e0-7a94-11eb-ad7e-7803c951c607" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung 980 NVMe SSD]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung 980 NVMe SSD]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
