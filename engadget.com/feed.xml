Devindra Hardawar reviewed AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 and determined that its lackluster performance and features made the GPU hard to praise, particularly when chip shortages have forced skyrocketing prices. Nicole Lee carried the Facebook Portal Go around her house and found its features don’t entirely outweigh the flaws. I tracked my twin’s daily habits with the Talli one-touch tracker and liked it more than I thought I would, plus Cherlynn Low found that she wasn’t totally sold on Microsoft’s latest Surface Duo 2 folding smartphone.</p><h2>Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html">still struggling</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ba6d8380-3204-11ec-bd5b-227f37b87019" style="height:1182;width:2100;" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 stands almost closed, with the logo on its back facing the camera." data-uuid="92ca33ff-74e3-31a2-a40e-2b54f2a4b8f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low admits right away that the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/2ZfQS2Y">Surface Duo 2</a> is a frustrating device, despite upgrades to the cameras, software and performance. At $1,500, it remains a pricey and niche foldable phone. The newest version offers a combined 8.3-inch screen and it runs Android 11. Cherlynn says the hardware is attractive with an impressively thin profile and a sleek silhouette. The unique 1,892 x 1,344 resolution produced some odd aspect ratios, but overall, apps expanded to cover the whole screen when the automatic-span setting was enabled.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Cherlynn liked the 90Hz refresh rate, the lovely AMOLED panels and the video quality, she was disappointed that the Duo 2 didn’t have any functionality when closed since, unlike competing smartphones, it doesn’t have an external screen. She also experienced occasional software issues: the system periodically required repeated taps to register, and the UI was finicky with swipe-based navigation. But she was most let down by the camera, which disables the rear shooters depending on the position of the phone. In the end, she could only recommend the device to those who really need a dual-screen phone and have $1,500 to spare.</p><h2>AMD’s Radeon RX 6600 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6600-review-gpu-120013965.html">shouldn’t be your first pick</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/becc4a80-3298-11ec-b5bf-4f19b4004bb0" alt="AMD Radeon RX 6600 " data-uuid="54e83c91-a234-3d6f-92fc-b9b5ed7f2ecd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>In his review of the <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6600">Radeon RX 6600</a>, Devindra Hardawar wonders who this GPU is for. Although the card has speedy 1080p load performance, its ray tracing was lackluster at best, its upscaling abilities are limited and it has fewer features than competing cards from NVIDIA. This makes it difficult to recommend, particularly because there’s no way to estimate how much the card will cost due to the global chip shortage and ballooning prices.</p><p>During testing, Devindra found the RX 6600 to be a capable gaming card. It reached 120FPS in <em>Destiny 2 </em>with maxed out graphics, but stumbled when he pushed the game to 1440p. Similarly, during the <em>Hitman 3 </em>benchmark, the GPU reached a respectable 138fps in 1080p, but again faltered once Devindra pushed it to 1440p. He says the RX 6600 could be an upgrade for some because of its Smart Access Memory, which allows your CPU to directly address your video card&#39;s RAM. Otherwise, he says the GPU can only compete if the market stabilizes and the price drops below $300.</p><h2>The Portal Go brings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html">Facebook video chat all over your house</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/230814c0-3299-11ec-b9b9-74ac8ff36e6b" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="1c3beb45-536b-32e0-8a62-632fa00590a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicole Lee/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nicole Lee approves of the design updates made to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Facebook&#x002019;s Portal Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Facebook’s Portal Go</a>, which now features a grey fabric enclosure and rounded corners. The improvements make the Go easy to prop up on a lap or hold while you walk around the house. Part tablet and part smart display, the Go touts smart camera tracking via the 12-megapixel wide-angle lens that uses AI-powered technology to automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame. This makes it easier to get several people in the picture on a call, and it works in third-party apps as well.</p><p>Nicole says she was impressed by the video capabilities of the 10.1-inch display, which has the same 1,280 x 800 resolution as previous Portal devices. She was particularly pleased by the adaptive lighting features like Night Mode, which reduces the amount of blue light in the evening. It also provides decent audio thanks to its two full-range speakers and subwoofer, so it can double as a portable speaker in a pinch. Nicole also managed to squeeze a little over six hours out of the battery — more than the company’s claims of five. Despite this, she says the Go is your best choice only if Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp are your primary video call services.</p><h2>Talli’s one-touch tracker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-talli-baby-tracker-is-a-one-touch-system-for-logging-kids-activities-130022927.html">makes it easy to log kids habits</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/49a94d60-3299-11ec-bff8-f2fcd3e50846" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="4c81d24c-6b38-302b-8d2a-53518a583371"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Talli Baby</div></figure><p>Although I like the app I use to track my twins&#39; daily habits, I was curious about <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Talli&#x002019;s dedicated hardware" href="https://fave.co/3AXz8pW">Talli’s dedicated hardware</a>. A sleek box with eight buttons , the Talli is intended to help busy parents track their kids&#39; stats with a single button press. I have to admit: I found it a lot more useful than I thought I would. Being able to push a button to log a medication or a bottle without having to open my phone, launch an app and enter in details was a welcome relief.</p><p>The Talli tracker also pairs with an app that records and graphs your child’s daily activities. The app is standalone, meaning you don&#39;t have to buy the physical tracker to use it, and there&#39;s no subscription required in order to access features or data. If you get the device, it runs on AA batteries and can be left freestanding or be wall mounted. I’ll admit I had a challenging time trying to find the exact right location for the Talli. Grabbing it often resulted in an accidental button press, but that didn’t diminish its usefulness. It can also work alongside an Alexa skill enabling parents to log events by saying “Alexa, tell Talli Baby that Sam had a bottle.” At $99, it’s a bit pricey for a single-function device, but if you’re looking to establish a routine of recording your baby’s habits, it can make things more convenient.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-microsofts-surface-duo-2-still-needs-some-work-160035942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69b43ea5-761a-458d-b6d5-abca6eeb9632</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 16:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634842914</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T19:02:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page.

Available from Basic Books, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>The first archaeological evidence that people were dairying dates to around 8,500 years ago — 2,000 years after cattle domestication. In Anatolia (present-day eastern Turkey), which is pretty far from the original center of cattle domestication, archaeologists recovered milk fat residues from ceramic pots, indicating that people were processing milk by heating it up. Similar analyses of milk fat proteins in ceramics record the spread of dairying into Europe, which appears to have happened simultaneously with the spread of domestic cattle.</p><p>It’s not surprising that people began dairying soon after cattle domestication. Milk is the primary source of sugar, fat, vitamins, and protein for newborn mammals, and as such is evolved expressly to be nutritious. It would not have taken much imagination for a cattle herder to deduce that a cow’s milk would be just as good for him and his family as it was for her calf. The only challenge would have been digesting it—without the lactase persistence mutation, that is.</p><p>Because lactase persistence allows people to take advantage of calories from lactose, it also makes sense that the spread of the lactase persistence mutation and the spread of dairying would be tightly linked. If the mutation arose near the start of dairying or was already present in a population that acquired dairying technology, the mutation would have given those who had it an advantage over those who did not. Those with the mutation would, with access to additional resources from milk, more efficiently convert animal protein into more people, and the mutation would increase in frequency.</p><p>Curiously, though, ancient DNA has not found the lactase persistence mutation in the genomes of early dairy farmers, and the mutation is at its lowest European frequency today in the precise part of the world where dairying began. The first dairy farmers were not, it seems, drinking milk. Instead, they were processing milk by cooking or fermenting it, making cheeses and sour yogurts to remove the offending indigestible sugars.</p><p>If people can consume dairy products without the lactase persistence mutation, there must be some other explanation as to why the mutation is so prevalent today. And lactase persistence is remarkably prevalent. Nearly a third of us have lactase persistence, and at least five different mutations have evolved—all on the same stretch of intron 13 of the MCM6 gene—that make people lactase persistent. In each case, these mutations have gone to high frequency in the populations in which they evolved, indicating that they provide an enormous evolutionary advantage. Is being able to drink milk (in addition to eating cheese and yogurt) sufficient to explain why these mutations have been so important?</p><p>The most straightforward hypothesis is that, yes, the benefit of lactase persistence is tied to lactose, the sugar that represents about 30 percent of the calories in milk. Only those who can digest lactose have access to these calories, which may have been crucial calories during famines, droughts, and disease. Milk may also have provided an important source of clean water, which also may have been limited during periods of hardship.</p><p>Another hypothesis is that milk drinking provided access to calcium and vitamin D in addition to lactose, the complement of which aids calcium absorption. This might benefit particular populations with limited access to sunlight, as ultraviolet radiation from sun exposure is necessary to stimulate the body’s production of vitamin D. However, while this might explain the high frequency of lactase persistence in places like northern Europe, it cannot explain why populations in relatively sunny climates, such as parts of Africa and the Middle East, also have high frequencies of lactase persistence.</p><p>Neither this hypothesis nor the more straightforward hypothesis linked to lactase can explain why lactase persistence is at such low frequency in parts of Central Asia and Mongolia where herding, pastoralism, and dairying have been practiced for millennia. For now, the jury is still out as to why lactase persistence has reached such high frequencies in so many different parts of the world, and why it remains at low frequencies in some regions where dairying is economically and culturally important.</p><p>Ancient DNA has shed some light on when and where the lactase persistence mutation arose and spread in Europe. None of the remains from pre-Neolithic archaeological sites—economies that relied on hunting and gathering—have the lactase persistence mutation. None of the ancient Europeans from early farming populations in southern and central Europe (people believed to be descended from farmers spreading into Europe from Anatolia) had the lactase persistence mutation. Instead, the oldest evidence of the lactase persistence mutation in Europe is from a 4,350-year-old individual from central Europe. Around that same time, the mutation is found in a single individual from what is now Sweden and at two sites in northern Spain. While these data are sparse, the timing is coincident with another major cultural upheaval in Europe: the arrival of Asian pastoralists of the Yamnaya culture. Perhaps the Yamnaya brought with them not only horses, wheels, and a new language, but an improved ability to digest milk.</p><p>The mystery of lactase persistence in humans highlights the complicated interaction among genes, environment, and culture. The initial increase in frequency of a lactase persistence mutation, regardless of in whom it first arose, may have happened by chance. When the Yamnaya arrived in Europe, for example, they brought disease—specifically plague—that devastated native European populations. When populations are small, genes can drift quickly to higher frequency regardless of what benefit they might provide. If the lactase persistence mutation was already present when plague appeared and populations crashed, the mutation’s initial increase may have happened surreptitiously. When populations recovered, dairying was already widespread and the benefit to those with the mutation would have been immediate. By domesticating cattle and developing dairying technologies, our ancestors created an environment that changed the course of our own evolution.</p><p>We continue to live and evolve in this human-constructed niche. In 2018, our global community produced 830 million metric tons (more than 21 billion US gallons) of milk, 82 percent of which was from cattle. The rest comes from a long list of other species that people domesticated within the last 10,000 years. Sheep and goats, which together make up around 3 percent of global milk production, were first farmed for their milk in Europe around the same time as cattle dairying began. Buffaloes were domesticated in the Indus Valley 4,500 years ago and are today the second largest producer of milk next to cattle, producing around 14 percent of the global supply. Camels, which were domesticated in Central Asia 5,000 years ago, produce around 0.3 percent of the world’s milk supply. People also consume milk from horses, which were first milked by people of the Botai culture 5,500 years ago; yaks, which were domesticated in Tibet 4,500 years ago; donkeys, which were domesticated in Arabia or East Africa 6,000 years ago; and reindeer, which are still in the process of being domesticated. But those are just the most common dairy products. Dairy products from more exotic species—moose, elk, red deer, alpacas, llamas—can be purchased and consumed today, and rumor has it that Top Chef ’s Edward Lee is working out how to make pig milk ricotta, should one want to try such a thing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-life-as-we-made-it-beth-shapiro-hachette-book-group-153038211.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08d4fbf9-7de4-46fc-bb69-b013d42f0403</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 15:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634247186</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:33:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nutrition]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/608d4e50-0298-11eb-9efb-7e07d29328eb" width="6508" height="4337" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/608d4e50-0298-11eb-9efb-7e07d29328eb" width="6508" height="4337" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clara Bastian via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cows together gathering in the pasture, funny and joyful and a blue cloudy sky.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Group of cows together gathering in a field, happy and joyful and a blue cloudy sky.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile postpones Sprint 3G shutdown to March 31st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile will wait a while longer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-fcc-letter-t-mobile-212911598.html">shut down Sprint&#39;s 3G network</a>. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22741762/tmobile-delays-shutdown-sprint-3g-network-dish-boost">reports</a> T-Mobile has <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/update-on-our-cdma-network-transition-plans">delayed</a> the CDMA network shutdown from January 1st, 2022 to March 31st of that year. The carrier pinned the delay on &quot;partners&quot; who hadn&#39;t &quot;followed through&quot; on helping their customers transition to newer network technology.</p><p>This would supposedly give partners &quot;every opportunity&quot; to fulfill their obligations. &quot;There should be no more room for excuses,&quot; T-Mobile said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The explanation appears to be a not-so-subtle attempt to pin the blame on Dish. The satellite TV provider <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-acquires-boost-mobile-wireless-carrier-171217646.html">bought Boost Mobile</a> from T-Mobile in July 2020 and planned to use Sprint&#39;s legacy network until it could move Boost customers to its 5G service. Dish argued this didn&#39;t give it enough time to migrate its customers, and accused T-Mobile of anti-competitive behavior meant to push Boost exiles to T-Mobile.</p><p>This may be a response to both Dish&#39;s original accusation and the ensuing fallout. The Justice Department told Dish and T-Mobile <a href="https://dish.gcs-web.com/static-files/d0097e8d-56b9-486a-bc0a-1190e7141481">in July</a> that it had serious concerns about the Sprint network shutdown, asking the two companies to do whatever was necessary to lessen the blow. The delay might address those worries and reduce the chances of more serious government scrutiny.</p><p>A delayed shutdown still isn&#39;t ideal. T-Mobile expects to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-lte-101022638.html">shutter Sprint&#39;s LTE network</a> on June 30th, 2022. This leaves a three-month window where Boost customers might have LTE access, but nothing else. While you&#39;ll probably have made a decision by the March cutoff if you&#39;re a customer, this won&#39;t be a very gradual shift for some users — they&#39;ll have just a short period of limited Boost service before they have to embrace 5G.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-3g-cdma-shutdown-delay-151546831.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5411914b-eac7-4b05-bbda-47ed06ce7d89</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 15:15:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635002148</ingested><modified>2021-10-23T15:15:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65f06cf0-340c-11ec-9f87-cbaf90294e22" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65f06cf0-340c-11ec-9f87-cbaf90294e22" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, UNITED STATES - 2020/01/23: American telecommunications company Sprint logo seen at one of their stores.

Sure, OS X was intriguing, and the titanium PowerBook was definitely a cool computer, But when most people thought of Apple, it was probably the bulbous, colorful iMac G3 that popped into people’s heads. The company was starting to build its reputation for truly desirable products, but it wasn’t solidified just yet.</p><p>That all changed <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2001/10/23Apple-Presents-iPod/">on October 23, 2001</a>, when Steve Jobs pulled the first iPod out of his pocket. For a generation of music fans, it became the quintessentially cool item that was more than just a fad. It’s not a stretch to say it reinvented the music industry while simultaneously paving a path for Apple to become the world’s biggest company. It was the ultimate gateway drug to getting people who had never bought an Apple product before to see what all the fuss was about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d5715c51f47d47d883d9a890df5b6c71"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mc_FiHTITHE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>At this point, the somewhat skeptical reception to the iPod is part of tech industry lore – particularly Slashdot’s <a href="https://slashdot.org/story/01/10/23/1816257/apple-releases-ipod">dismissal of the product</a> as “lame” compared to a Nomad MP3 player. (Raise your hand if you ever used a Nomad. That’s what I thought.) And it’s not like the product was an instant hit – the first iPod cost $400 and only worked with the Mac, two factors that limited its appeal.</p><div id="91fb110a046c42679f9d5019e9e9f30e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mE_bDNaYAr8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Those limitations helped it achieve some serious&nbsp;cachet, though. Seeing an iPod in the wild was a rarity, and my Mac-owning friends who were early adopters had to deal with my incessant questions and requests to hold it and spin its distinctive wheel. It didn’t help that my college suite-mate (who had a titanium PowerBook and iPod) and graphic designer friend (with a PowerMac G4 and iPod) were constantly going off about how great their hardware was. I was primed to become one of those switchers Apple liked to talk about in the early 2000s.</p><p>The iPod may have started out as a Mac-only product, but less than a year later, Apple opened it up to the other 98 percent of computer users by introducing a Windows-compatible model in the summer of 2002. Less than a year after that, Apple completely redesigned the iPod and released a new version of iTunes for Windows. At the same time, Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265172/itunes-store-at-10-how-apple-built-a-digital-media-juggernaut">launched the iTunes Music Store</a>, making it a lot easier to get legal music onto an iPod. With that, the iPod moved fully into the mainstream.</p><p>There’s no good way to quantify how many people bought an iPod for Windows and then eventually switched to a Mac. But, <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/222361/apple-by-the-numbers-mac-not-dead-yet-2.html">Mac sales increased</a> from about 3 million in 2003 to more than 7 million by 2007. Apple’s move to more powerful Intel processors in 2005 likely helped adoption, but the iPod “halo effect” was often cited in the mid-2000s as a driver of the Mac’s increasing popularity.</p><p>Growing Mac sales and the most popular consumer electronics device of the decade truly paved the way for the iPhone to be the monumental success that it was almost. Sure, the iPhone eventually killed the iPod, but <a href="https://gigaom.com/2007/09/05/419-steve-jobs-on-iphone-cannibals-nbc/">as Steve Jobs said</a>, he’d rather cannibalize Apple&#39;s sales with another Apple product than let some other company do it — this was how he justified the existence of the iPod touch, which was basically an iPhone without a phone.</p><div id="a9215a553b4e4f019aa2634876ed3d82"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OvHz2aIZozA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>I might be overselling the iPod to Mac to iPhone evolution, because I lived it. After getting a second-generation iPod in 2002 (embarrassing admission time: I also bought four more full-size iPods between then and 2009), I got my first Mac in 2003 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-07-03-iphone-review-part-1-hardware-interface-keyboard.html">the first iPhone</a> in late 2007. I remember being more excited about my first iPhone than my first iPod, mostly because it was light years better than the Moto RAZR I was using at the time. But my first iPod was similarly a huge step forward from the MP3 players I owned before. And in my early 20s, there was nothing more important to me than music.</p><p>That may not make me unique, but it’s still true. Before the iPod was everywhere, someone else who had one was someone you could trust. They took music as seriously as you did; they knew how liberating it was to have your 100 favorite albums with you, on demand, any time you needed them. In a world where Apple Music offers access to 90 million songs anywhere you are for 10 bucks a month, that might seem quaint. But 20 years ago, it was a revelation.</p><p>I still have the last iPod I ever purchased, a 2008 iPod classic with 120GB of storage – about the same space as I have in my iPhone 12 Pro. It’s still stuffed to the gills with music, some 11,000-plus songs, most of which come from albums  I carefully selected over time. Most of them are still in my Apple Music library, which has now ballooned to more than double that size, with over 25,000 songs.</p><p>I’m still a firm believer in the art of making a good album, but I’ve also collected thousands of singles, or a handful of songs from artists who catch my ear on one of the many curated playlists out there. The music industry has changed, and so have I. Whether or not that’s a good thing is a debate for another time, but there’s no doubt that both the music and technology industries changed completely because of the iPod – something its humble introduction 20 years ago only barely hinted at.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipod-20th-anniversary-140004112.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7c38fb85-ad45-44b6-9c77-0bde93a3c3bf</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 23 Oct 2021 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634935103</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T20:38:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4cc948a0-3376-11ec-bd7f-99ba52d26aa6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4cc948a0-3376-11ec-bd7f-99ba52d26aa6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's iPod Classic music player (2008 model).]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPod Classic]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe gives all US employees until December 8th to get COVID-19 vaccine]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More and more tech companies are issuing COVID-19 vaccine mandates to comply with the government&#39;s directives.

More recently, she helped Team USA secure the bronze medal at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tokyo-olympics-parade-of-nations-video-game-music-125715215.html">2021 Summer Olympics in Tokyo</a> with a pair of goals in a match that ended with a four-three score. While Tuesday will mark Lloyd’s final game with Team USA, she’ll play out the remainder of the NSWL season with Gotham FC before finally hanging up her jersey.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/carli-lloyd-iso-cam-fox-sports-222353028.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f462a3db-be72-4de4-b8fd-65e894eb702e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 22:23:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634939291</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T21:48:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3a0804f0-337f-11ec-bfff-0f1074a125bd" width="2444" height="1375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3a0804f0-337f-11ec-bfff-0f1074a125bd" width="2444" height="1375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Henry Romero / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Soccer Football - Women - Bronze medal match - Australia v United States - Ibaraki Kashima Stadium, Ibaraki, Japan - August 5, 2021.

The latest complaint, which was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/facebook-new-whistleblower-complaint/"><ins>first reported</ins></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>, alleges Facebook misled its investors about “dangerous and criminal behavior on its platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.”</p><p>In the complaint, the former employee described a conversation with one of Facebook’s top communication executives who, following disclosures about Russia’s use of the platform to meddle in the 2016 election, said the scandal would be a “flash in the pan” and that “we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">Frances Haugen</a>, the latest whistleblower is also a former member of Facebook’s integrity team, which was tasked with fighting misinformation, voting interference and other major problems facing the company. And, like Haugen, the former Facebook staffer said that the company has “routinely undermined efforts to fight misinformation, hate speech and other problematic content out of fear of angering then-President Trump and his political allies, or out of concern about potentially dampening the user growth.”</p><p>The SEC filing also describes illegal activity in secret Facebook Groups, and Facebook’s policy of allowing politicians and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-oversight-board-said-the-company-failed-to-provide-relevant-information-132603146.html">high-profile users</a> to skirt its rules. It names Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg as being aware of the problems and not reporting them to investors, according to <em>The Post</em>.</p><p>While many of the details sound similar to other complaints from former company insiders, news of another complaint adds to the pressure on Facebook, which has spent much of the last month trying to discredit Haugen and downplay the significance of its own research. Meanwhile, lawmakers have called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-blumenthal-says-zuckerberg-needs-to-testify-about-instagram-and-kids-194805814.html">on Zuckerberg</a> to answer questions from Congress, and Haugen is expected to brief European officials as well.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Zuckerberg is expected to announce plans to rebrand the company with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">a new name</a> next week.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/another-former-facebook-employee-has-become-a-whistleblower-195851118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea941dd5-6037-4692-9c8c-8195e3037b26</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 19:58:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634932890</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T20:01:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41752c60-336e-11ec-bcd5-b70ec5b4eeb2" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41752c60-336e-11ec-bcd5-b70ec5b4eeb2" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 23: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/">says</a> The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) violated a licensing agreement when it recently launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-social-network-defaced-124507041.html"><ins>test version of TRUTH Social</ins></a>. The website ran on a modified version of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/"><ins>Mastodon</ins></a>, a free and open-source platform for operating Twitter-like social media networks. Anyone can use Mastodon provided they comply with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a>, the software license that governs its code.</p><p>One of the central provisions of AGPLv3 is that licensees must share their source code with all users. In the short time a test version of TRUTH Social was up earlier today, it did not do that. Now, the Software Freedom Conservancy, an organization that enforces open source software licenses, says TMTG has 30 days to comply with AGPLv3 or face the consequences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The license purposefully treats everyone equally (even people we don’t like or agree with), but they must operate under the same rules of the copyleft licenses that apply to everyone else,” SFC said in a blog post.</p><p>It says the company must “immediately” make TRUTH Social’s source code available to everyone who accessed the site earlier in the day. If TMTG fails to do so in 30 days, it will permanently lose access to the software it used to build its platform. “That’s how AGPLv3’s cure provision works — no exceptions — even if you’re a real estate mogul, reality television star, or even a former POTUS,” the SFC said. If TMTG doesn’t comply with the request, it could face a lawsuit. “We will be following this issue very closely and demanding that Trump’s Group give the corresponding source to all who use the site,” SFC said.</p><p>In closing, SFC shared details about how TRUTH Social was defaced earlier in the day.

There weren&#39;t any enormous spaceships ready to rocket off to planets in distant galaxies. No Brutalist palaces amid endless desert vistas. No building-sized sandworms roaming about, eager to devour anyone who disturbed them. Just me and traffic on Atlanta&#39;s I-285.</p><p>This latest <em>Dune </em>adaptation isn&#39;t perfect — it&#39;s at times emotionally empty, and it&#39;s basically set up for a second movie we may never see — but it successfully transported me to the universe Frank Herbert created over half a century ago. The film focuses on half of the novel, telling the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a sheltered baron&#39;s son who moves to the desert planet of Arrakis. It&#39;s an important post, since it&#39;s the only world that produces the melange, or spice, which powers interstellar travel. But as Paul quickly learns, it&#39;s also a dangerous place for his elite family, and it&#39;s where he learns he may also be a potential messiah. You know, typical teen boy stuff.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e0-335a-11ec-9ffd-282aebcb8788" alt="Dune" data-uuid="fdc40a1d-4113-360b-b387-2b5e053f6bbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>After being wowed by <em>Dune</em> in the theater, I plan to rewatch it at home on HBO Max, where it&#39;s also being released today. But I&#39;m certain the experience won&#39;t be the same, even on my 120-inch projector screen. This <em>Dune</em> demands to be seen on something even bigger—a place where your very sense of being can be dwarfed. <em>Dune</em> made me feel like Paul Atreides standing in front of a skyscraper-sized sandworm, waiting to be consumed. And I welcomed it.</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s no simple thing to trek out to the cinema these days, not with coronavirus still raging and fellow theatergoers refusing to take basic safety precautions. (The vaccines are safe. Masks work. Please protect yourself and others.) But if you can manage to safely see it in theaters — perhaps by renting out a private screen with friends — you&#39;ll be reminded of what makes that experience so special. I watched it in the second row of a fairly typical multiplex theater, and it still floored me. I can only imagine what it would be like on a full-sized IMAX screen, which can reach up to 98 feet tall.</p><div id="e3552a2868264a6b8244b7d5cca0e857"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0HgHet0sxg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Dune</em> is at its best when Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser let you soak in the vistas, the regal-yet-alien costumes and the wealth of background details. It&#39;s pure visual world-building. At one point, a character&#39;s eyes briefly flash white when he&#39;s asked to compute the cost of an imperial envoy&#39;s trek through the stars. It&#39;s never explained, but <em>you get it</em>. This style of slow burn sci-fi isn&#39;t for everyone, but if you enjoyed <em>Arrival</em> or <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, Villeneuve&#39;s previous genre forays, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re primed for this brand of storytelling.</p><p>Even before I saw anything on the screen, though, I felt <em>Dune</em> in my gut. As I waited for my screening to begin, an alien voice began speaking out of nowhere, sounding like it came entirely from the theater&#39;s subwoofers. It posed a question about the power of dreams, but really, it was as if the movie was saying, &quot;Sit up, pay attention, you&#39;re not on Earth anymore.&quot;</p><section data-eng-breakout="4341db2ce314418cab560b07cc9b1bf0" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" alt="Dune"></section><p>The film&#39;s inventive sound design doesn&#39;t stop there. Everything you hear — from the roar of spaceships as they take off, the buzz of dragonfly-like vehicles as they flap their wings, or the sphincter-clenching roar of the sandworms — is meticulously crafted to make you believe it&#39;s all real. Hans Zimmer&#39;s score doesn&#39;t tread too far from his <em>Gladiator </em>vibe, but does a fine job of making everything sound epic. (And yes, I was blasting it down the highway as I sped back home.)</p><p>Don&#39;t take my praise for this movie as disrespect towards David Lynch&#39;s 1984 <em>Dune. </em>That was a troubled production that&#39;s since attained cult status, but it was hampered by meddling producers and a script that tried to cram in the entire novel. Villenueve&#39;s approach is more confident and, as you&#39;d expect, is backed by far more capable visual effects technology. Even though it runs for two hours and 35 minutes, I could have easily given up another three hours to watch the rest of the story.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a001-335a-11ec-bd6b-51bf9f6ffe98" alt="Dune" data-uuid="a60b1100-ad0e-372e-b895-6c623594a3a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s a chance we won&#39;t see that conclusion. Warner Bros. originally agreed to let Villeneuve tell the story in two parts (this movie&#39;s title card says &quot;<em>Dune Part 1&quot;), but </em>the follow-up still hasn&#39;t been officially greenlit. The <a href="https://variety.com/video/dune-denis-villeneuve-part-two-rebecca-ferguson/#recipient_hashed=ca6bf125ba1d9e0643825bb798806510a6792220ab8ce995c97069e04442b39b">director told <em>Variety</em></a> that his plan to shoot both parts at once was denied—he expects to hear more from the studio once we see how <em>Dune </em>performs in theaters and on HBO Max. Plans for a prequel TV series, <em>Dune: The Sisterhood</em>, are still in the works with Villeneuve attached to produce.</p><p>As epic as <em>Dune</em> is, it&#39;s a shame that its scope couldn&#39;t fit in actors from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), cultures that Herbert was clearly inspired by. The film almost goes out of its way to diminish any Islamic influence from its story (instead of Jihad, there are references to a crusade). That&#39;s particularly egregious when we see the locals of Arrakis, the blue-eyed sand dwellers known as the Fremen, who are often portrayed as noble savages. At least the film begins with the Fremen perspective: Chani, played by Zendaya, wonders aloud who their next oppressors will be.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you can make it to the theater to see <em>Dune</em>, you should. You can still capture some of its immensity by watching it up close: Pull a chair right up to your TV, or veg out with a laptop as close to your eyeballs as possible. But <em>Dune</em> is a story that hinges on the power of dreams, so it’s almost fitting that it’s best experienced when it overwhelms your reality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40303099-0a6e-4fa6-8279-231edaefe317</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634927503</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T18:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a000-335a-11ec-8e3f-9b2de6217e27" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a000-335a-11ec-8e3f-9b2de6217e27" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter adds one-click Revue newsletter signup buttons to tweets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> is <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/the_week_in_newsletters/issues/subscribe-from-tweets-a-new-feature-for-revue-writers-820690">rolling out</a> a way for people to sign up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/revue/"><ins>Revue</ins></a> newsletters directly from tweets.

The tweet reads (in true viral bait style)  “Please don’t use a Calculator, use your BRAIN: 50+50 - 25 x 0 + 2 + 2 = ??”.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7db513ae3a964de0b43eb0aca9195e4f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please don’t use a Calculator, use your BRAIN:<br><br>50 + 50 - 25 x 0 + 2 + 2 = ??</p>— Sonia 💙 (@Sonia_ar7) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sonia_ar7/status/1444007420863385637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Now, the equation is sufficiently ambiguous in its design that, depending on how you tackle it, it produces a number of different answers. In this instance, users concluded that the answer was definitely 0, 4, 79 or 104. The subsequent chat often breaks out into some discussion about how Order of Operations work and how stupid the other people are. Between argument, counter-argument, and people smugly retweeting about how other people didn’t pay attention to high school math, the original poster has succeeded in getting their engagement.</p><p>But there is a solution, and a neat way of arriving at the correct answer both for this problem and for any others you see online. And I’ve enlisted the help of a mathematician to help explain it so that this sort of viral bait never trips you up ever again. Especially if you don’t recall your PEMDAS (or BODMAS, if you were raised on the other side of the pond) from high school math.</p><p>Dr. Helen Crowley is lecturer in mathematics at the <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/">University of East Anglia</a>, and took issue with how I’d described the equation. “The problem shared [above] is not actually ambiguous at all,” she said, “maths is a very well-behaved subject and there are fixed rules that all problems like this follow.” Dr. Crowley is, of course, referring to the Order of Operations, which explains how a multi-part equation like the one above is meant to be broken down and worked out.</p><p>In the US and UK, Order of Operations is expressed under the acronyms PEMDAS (US) or BODMAS (UK). The terms may differ, but the order in which you calculate each component part of the equation remains the same. You start with anything in Parentheses / Brackets, and then move on to anything using Exponents / Orders, which are figures including square-roots and powers. The equation above, uses neither.</p><p>Third in the list is Multiplication and Division, which is the first function that we actually need to do. “For this problem, we [first] do 25 x 0 = 0,” said Dr. Crowley. That 0 then inserts itself into the sum, which now looks like 50 + 50 - 0 + 2 + 2. “The last two operations to consider are Addition and Subtraction,” said Dr. Crowley, making the final sum 50 + 50 - 0 + 2 + 2 = 104. “This is exactly what your calculator does, as it is programmed to ‘know’ the order,” said Dr. Crowley, “the above problem certainly isn’t ambiguous, we are just forgetting the rules.”</p><p>Now, you may be wondering who was in charge of establishing this order, and when that may have happened. According to the UEA’s Dr. Mark Cooker, the current Order of Operations was probably first laid down in their current form in the middle of the 16th century. Before that point, “manuscripts were wholly wordy, and free from operational symbols, except abbreviations,” said Dr. Cooker. But from the mid-16th century onwards, math texts “were first printed in large numbers for education.”</p><p>Cooker then believes that it was the wide-ranging influence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London</a> that “set new high standards to reduce ambiguity in handling powers, brackets and multiplications or additions, in the correct order.” He said that the journal, as it would now be described, “spread higher standards of maths typography as far afield as St. Petersburg, where Leonard Euler was working.” Euler was one of the most pioneering mathematicians of the 18th century, who “published so many papers and influential textbooks,” along with “clear explanations of BODMAS rules in his elementary texts must have made everyone agree on the current order of operations.”</p><p>Now that you know how to solve those crappy equations people post on social media, don’t forget to share a link to this story to serve as a bulwark against folks cynically trying to juice their engagement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/equation-social-media-scams-numberwang-153015485.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3df02fe6-e745-4780-994a-cf63de448715</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634912071</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T14:14:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22245600-324d-11ec-bf3f-de1a49e34dba" width="4992" height="3328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22245600-324d-11ec-bf3f-de1a49e34dba" width="4992" height="3328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[C.

The app is now testing affiliate shops, a feature it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html"><ins>first previewed</ins></a> at its Creator Week event in June, and a dedicated “partnerships” inbox.</p><p>Affiliate shops are an extension of Facebook’s existing shopping features, which are already widely available. But the latest version of the storefronts allow creators to link to products that are already part of their <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-week-2021-new-ways-for-creators-to-make-a-living"><ins>affiliate arrangements</ins></a>. Creators will earn commission fees when their followers buy products from these shops (though the exact terms of these arrangements haven’t been detailed). The company says that for now the shopping feature will only be available to creators who are part of that affiliate program.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instagram is also testing new inbox features it says will make it easier for brands to connect with creators for sponsorships. Instagram DMs will get a dedicated “partnerships” section just for messages from brands. The company says this will give those messages “priority placement” and will allow them to skip the “requests” section where incoming messages are often lost.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6e5f16a0-32ce-11ec-bebb-c24a545ad5d3" style="height:1026;width:1330;" alt="Instagram is testing a new inbox for messages from potential partners." data-uuid="de090c7d-daa8-39ea-b048-dc4e6331a531"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Instagram</div></figure><p>Separately, the app is working on tools to match brands with creators looking for sponsorships. With the tools, creators can identify brands they are interested in working with directly from the app. While brands would be able to browse creators who fit their needs based on factors like age, gender and follower count.</p><p>The tools are still in an early stage, with only a handful of companies and creators participating for now. But the company has previously signaled such features could expand significantly. Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that Instagram is planning a “branded content marketplace” to help enable a bigger “creator middle class.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-testing-affiliate-shops-and-partnerships-inbox-150021537.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea9224fe-f47c-4623-b240-ae5f191bcdbc</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634862857</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T00:34:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36918140-32ce-11ec-9aff-5ca5d054d2d6" width="1944" height="1120" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36918140-32ce-11ec-9aff-5ca5d054d2d6" width="1944" height="1120" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram is testing its new affiliate shopping tools.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IG affiliate shops]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlayStation's next State of Play is set for October 27th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has announced when its next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/state%20of%20play/"><ins>State of Play</ins></a> stream will take place. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/22/state-of-play-returns-next-wednesday/">You can watch it</a> on October 27th at 5PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2Y8dQb0S6DtpxNgAKoJKA"><ins>YouTube</ins></a>.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a short broadcast, clocking in at 20 minutes or so, but as we saw with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-event-september-2021-sony-recap-video-214354767.html"><ins>Sony&#39;s blockbuster showcase in September</ins></a>, it can pack a lot into these events.

It&#39;s worth noting that the remastered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-gta-san-andreas-xbox-one-backwards-compatibility.html"><em><ins>GTA: San Andreas</ins></em></a> hits Xbox Game Pass on November 11th and the upgraded <em>GTA III</em> will arrive on PlayStation Now on December 7th.</p><p>The most obvious changes to the games are upgraded, richer visuals. Rockstar has added higher resolution textures, enhanced the weather effects, improved character and vehicle models, overhauled the lighting system and increased draw distances — all while trying to hang onto each game&#39;s original aesthetic.<em> Vice City, </em>for one thing, looks far more vibrant than the original, but it&#39;s clearly still <em>Vice City</em>.</p><p>There are some platform-specific enhancements. PS5 and Xbox Series X players will be able to run the games in 4K at up to 60 frames per second. On PC, there&#39;s support for NVIDIA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dlss"><ins>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)</ins></a> upscaling tech. Switch players, meanwhile, will have gyro controls and can use the touchscreen to to navigate menus and to zoom and pan the camera.</p><p>Rockstar has tweaked the gameplay in other ways. The controller layout now matches that of <em>GTA V, </em>and there are changes to gunplay and targeting, the weapon and radio station selection wheels and minimaps (such as the ability to set waypoints). You&#39;ll also be able to immediately restart a mission after failing too, which is a great quality of life update.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-remastered-trilogy-release-date-140952983.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee78e0bc-bd64-497d-87b5-aa83d8097426</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 14:09:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634911795</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T14:10:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96bf04e0-333f-11ec-bfab-6b81acd6de4f" width="1530" height="845" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96bf04e0-333f-11ec-bfab-6b81acd6de4f" width="1530" height="845" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rockstar Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the cityscpace from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric Barone, aka &quot;ConcernedApe,&quot; has made a surprise unveiling of his next game, <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>. It has the same pixelated SNES look as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-1-5-update-214401409.html"><em>Stardew</em></a><em>,</em> with characters, set-pieces and themes that are similarly cute and quirky.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In this game, you will play as a chocolatier living in a haunted castle. In order to thrive in your new role, you will have to gather rare ingredients, make delicious chocolates, and sell them in a chocolate shop,&quot; according to Barone&#39;s <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/">blog</a> on the new website. The video shows characters heading out into into a town, the castle, a mountain and other scenarios to seek ingredients and fend off creatures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0ca5263b0e7a41508fdb8173cce999ff"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJy7LF789lo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It&#39;s Barone&#39;s first game since <em>Stardew Valley</em> launched in 2016, but so far it&#39;s not a lot more than a demo. Barone has yet to finalize the gameplay systems, and said he doesn&#39;t even want to be &quot;tied down to any particular concept of what the game is&quot; ahead of launch.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> does sound and look a lot like <em>Stardew</em> at first take. However, in a FAQ, Barone said there will be some substantial differences, particularly when it comes to gameplay.</p><blockquote><p>Like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> is another &quot;town game,&quot; where you move to a new town and try your hand at a new way of living. You’ll get to know the townspeople, achieve your goals and make progress in many ways. All of that is similar to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. However, the core gameplay and theming are quite a bit different. <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> is more of an action-RPG compared to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And instead of a farm being the focal point of your endeavors, it’s a chocolate shop.</p></blockquote><p>Barone wouldn&#39;t reveal other details, like whether the new title is set in the same world as <em>Stardew</em>, nor a release date or even a general timeframe. He did say that it would be single-player only, with no plans for multiplayer. The game will &quot;100 percent&quot; come to PC, though he has &quot;every intention of bringing it to the other major platforms as well.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-creators-next-game-is-haunted-chocolatier-133102155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">722f07f5-38a7-4f18-87bd-e3a8dbb3de93</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 13:31:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634909562</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T13:32:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a274e370-3337-11ec-bfff-f4f39e50f7ad" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a274e370-3337-11ec-bfff-f4f39e50f7ad" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eric Barone]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones fall to $248, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week brought our first official <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-deals-best-buy-early-black-friday-sale-october-2021-121526669.html">early Black Friday sale</a>, courtesy of Best Buy.

According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, someone signed up for an account on the test website, took the username &quot;donaldjtrump&quot; and posted a photo of a defecating pig.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump and his team recently announced that they&#39;re launching TRUTH Social in early 2022 and that beta tests will begin in November. In its announcement, the team said that the platform is part of its efforts to fight against &quot;the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The test website has already been pulled down, but not before one of the publication&#39;s reporters was able to sign up under the name &quot;mikepence&quot; without encountering any safeguards that would prevent them from doing so. Based on the mock photos on its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/truth-social/id1586018825">App Store listing</a>, TRUTH Social looks like a Twitter clone, where users can post &quot;Truths&quot; similar to tweets and repost &quot;Re-Truths,&quot; which are basically retweets. It has a news feed called the Truth Feed and a notification system, as well.</p><p>The website&#39;s code shows that it runs on a mostly unmodified version of open source software Mastodon, <em>The Post </em>says. Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump"><em>Vice</em></a> that the platform might be violating its licensing rules, since it requires developers to share any modification with the public and to give credit by linking to the original source code. The test website didn&#39;t just reveal TRUTH Social&#39;s code, though, but also its <a href="https://truthsocial.com/terms-of-service/">terms of service</a>.
