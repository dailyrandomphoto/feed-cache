The shooter sees the series&#39; iconic heroes back to fight an alien enemy as part of a new side-scrolling adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>The mobile entry also features new storylines and over 200 total levels, along with updated graphics. New and returning characters include grizzled commandos Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, Sheena from <em>Contra 4</em>, Lucia from <em>Contra: Shattered Soldier</em>, a bear and a werewolf named Brad Fang.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To give you a taster of the mayhem that awaits, Konami has released a live-action trailer that&#39;s equal parts apocalyptic destruction, sweaty machismo and gun fetishism. There&#39;s also plenty of camo and slo-mo strutting thrown in for good measure. Basically, all the ingredients you&#39;d expect from a fan-made <em>Contra</em> movie. At the end of the clip, there&#39;s a snippet of the frenetic, industrial shooter gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Contra Returns</em> originally launched in China back in 2017. Its success led to a Taiwanese release and an English-language version for Southeast Asia. TiMi, which recently struck a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-timi-xbox-game-studios-partnership-122240386.html">gaming partnership</a> with Xbox, previously <a href="https://twitter.com/timistudios/status/1285773580941197312?s=20">tweeted</a> that it was planning a wider rollout for the game. Since the mobile title&#39;s initial launch, there have been a couple of Contra games for PCs and consoles including 2019&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-28-contra-anniversary-collection-lineup.html"><em>Contra Anniversary Collection</em></a> and the run-and-gun shooter <em>Contra: Rogue Corps.</em></p><p>You can currently pre-register for the new mobile game on<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/contra-returns/id1543657739"> iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.proximabeta.game.contra">Android</a> to gain special awards when it drops.&nbsp;</p><div id="660a1992ef214e8e8d91b64e188a30d9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hS03sVdOB4w?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/contra-returns-mobile-us-release-124049426.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f387219f-7734-464a-89bc-1dde90b4f9ae</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 12:40:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624970125</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:35:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f386aa00-d8d3-11eb-afdd-f6e00353844c" width="1200" height="628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f386aa00-d8d3-11eb-afdd-f6e00353844c" width="1200" height="628" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Contra Returns]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Contra Returns]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Contra Returns]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon gives Music Unlimited subscribers up to six months of free Disney+]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is giving you <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-music-unlimited-customers-get-up-to-six-months-of-disney-access">free access to Disney+</a> if you pay for its music streaming service, perhaps in hopes of luring you away from Spotify and Apple Music.

Alongside the FAA&#39;s dedicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-faas-new-b4ufly-app-makes-it-easier-to-know-where-drones-are-al.html">B4UFLY</a> app, Alphabet&#39;s Wing also boasts a dedicated drone safety and navigation app that&#39;s now available in the US following its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-wing-open-sky-drone-air-traffic-control-app.html">debut in Australia</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Once downloaded, you can fire it up to check airspace restrictions that will dictate where you can and can&#39;t fly. No-go areas include stadiums and sporting events; airports; security sensitive locations such as military airbases, national landmarks and critical infrastructure like nuclear power plants; and even temporarily restricted sites that may be out of bounds because of an emergency (such as a wildfire). Having an app in your pocket that gives you that info in real-time is obviously an important resource.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With a green light from the FAA, Wing says you can also use OpenSky to quickly request authorization to fly in controlled airspace, including areas surrounding US airports. This is otherwise known as a Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability and is typically used by emergency response crews, commercial surveyors, or filmmakers and photographers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/31bae260-d8ba-11eb-bbfd-1afa8e730ff9" style="height:1270;width:760;" alt="OpenSky" data-uuid="b0a11560-2549-30da-8eaf-180cb0bfe5b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OpenSky</div></figure><p>Wing says the reason it&#39;s expanding the app is to enable people to fly more safely and boost compliance to ensure greater adoption of drones. Of course, the service collects plenty of data — including info about your device and its location and a connected drone&#39;s serial number, model details and flight plan — which should help Wing to build out its navigational systems and maybe even feed into its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-18-alphabet-wing-drone-deliveries-us-virginia.html">UAV deliveries</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past Alphabet has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-wing-on-faa-drone-rule-privacy-181133084.html">campaigned</a> against the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-remote-id-night-time-flight-235350517.html">FAA&#39;s remote drone ID license plate rules</a> over privacy concerns, but now finds itself in a position where it&#39;s also collecting location data.

Now, LG has <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/06/gaming-on-lg-premium-tvs-reach-new-heights-with-latest-dolby-vision-update/">announced</a> that it&#39;s rolling out a firmware update that unlocks Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on its latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:2021 C1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Jrq7Be">2021 C1</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:G1" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjD7E6">G1</a> series OLED models.&nbsp;</p><p>We knew that LG&#39;s high-end G1 and mainstream C1 series should be capable of 120 Hz 4K gaming with Dolby Vision, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdqCY9PEmKk">HDTV Test&#39;s Vincent Teoh</a> pointed out recently. However, Xbox Series X owners have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/mxt38a/dolby_vision_gaming_at_4k_120hz/">reporting</a> that those models weren&#39;t working, with an error message that &quot;your TV setup doesn&#39;t support Dolby Vision at 4K 120 Hz.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG told Teoh at the time that it was testing the functionality and working to bring it to market, and now it has done so with the firmware version 03.15.27. That makes the C1 and G1 series OLED TV models &quot;the first in the world capable of supporting Dolby Vision HDR at 4K 120Hz on compatible platforms,&quot; the company said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/36f71d10-d8ca-11eb-86df-e5acac4e3a20" alt="LG&#39;s latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming" data-uuid="88c530f2-247a-39d4-bb97-ecbaebe1e2e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>In addition, it&#39;s testing the feature on other 2021 models including the OLED Z1 series, QNED Mini LED QNED99 series and NanoCell NANO99 series, all slated to receive the update in July. &quot;Additional 2021 and 2020 TV models are also being tested for Dolby Vision gaming in either 60Hz or 120Hz,&quot; the company added. There&#39;s no word on whether its 2019 OLED models, some of which also support both 4K 120Hz and Dolby Vision, will be updated.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if you have an Xbox Series X or S console and 2021 LG G1 or S1 series TV, you&#39;ll be able to make the error message go away. However, you still won&#39;t be able to play any 4K 120Hz Dolby Vision games, because none exist at the moment. When they do eventually arrive, you should see not only more fluid playback, but brighter images, improved contrast and more vibrant, saturated colors — much as you do on Dolby Vision-encoded films and TV series.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with that feature, the new firmware also introduces the Game Dashboard (shown above), a floating menu that helps LG owners optimize settings. It works on any any 2021 LG TV with Game Optimizer, letting users switch between genres (standard, FPS, RPG or RTS). You&#39;ll also be able to see the status of modes like black stabilizer, low latency and variable refresh rate. The new update is now rolling out, so if you own a supported set, you should gain access to all of those features soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-tvs-120-hz-dolby-vision-gaming-114549499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23007136-5514-4a09-821a-d30da0093388</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 11:45:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969324</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:22:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/055aabb0-d8c4-11eb-baef-795443263274" width="1280" height="814" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG's latest OLED TVs are ready for 120Hz Dolby Vision gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon launches a vinyl of the month club]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>How can Samsung make its smartwatches as successful as the Apple Watch?

That said, if you act quickly, you can get a price deal on 4K Plus — YouTube is offering a one-month free trial to new users, after which you can sign up for $9.99 per month, a pretty good deal over the standard price.<a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html"><strong> Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html">&#39;Dune&#39; release gets pushed back again</a></h2><h3>Warner Bros. plans to release it simultaneously on HBO Max and theaters.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-release-further-delay-october-22-080305763.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0b043a11-d8c7-11eb-bbf7-41345ab912d9" style="height:404;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="56b600e0-e088-39a2-ba59-8833ec4968ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure></a><p>If you&#39;ve been waiting impatiently to see Denis Villeneuve&#39;s much-anticipated take on<em> Dune</em>, you&#39;ll have to keep on waiting.

Sony said that the studio&#39;s day-to-day operations will continue to be run by its current management team with input from PlayStation Studios personnel.</p><p>“Housemarque has flexed its creative palette on a wide range of PlayStation games over the years that have continually showcased the power of our hardware,” said Jim Ryan, president and CEO, Sony Interactive Entertainment. “The addition of Housemarque to PlayStation Studios reiterates our commitment to elevating the best development teams in the industry and delivering new experiences that can only be found on the PlayStation platform.”</p><p>“After more than 15 years of successfully collaborating, we’re excited to amplify our potential even further and join PlayStation Studios,” said Ilari Kuittinen, co-founder and managing director, Housemarque. “<em>Returnal </em>is a testament to our strong relationship with PlayStation Studios and the organization believing in us to take a risk and give us the freedom to explore our creativity and develop something unique. We can’t wait to bring PlayStation fans more fresh, new experiences.”</p><p>The deal also makes sense based on Sony&#39;s long-standing collaborative relationship with Housemarque. Several of the studio&#39;s biggest games were PlayStation console exclusives, including <em>Resogun</em>, <em>Alienation</em>, <em>Nex Machina</em> and <em>Matterfall</em>. It will now be tasked with repeating that success under the PlayStation Studios banner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3bdefe4b-6e6a-4327-831c-28d93a55c929</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:41:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624964977</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T11:09:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/eb6abd10-d8c5-11eb-bcfd-a3792f9172ee" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Housemarque]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's new support website will help you locate local US food banks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has launched a new website called <a href="https://findfoodsupport.withgoogle.com/">Find Food Support</a>, which puts important resources on how to locate free and affordable food in the US in one place. Perhaps the most useful feature the website can offer is a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-is-rolling-out-maps-improvements-to-the-benefit-of-drivers-and-pedestrians-alike-183243714.html">Google Maps</a> tool that can point you to the nearest food bank, food pantry or school lunch program pickup site.&nbsp;</p><p>As the tech giant explains, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated hunger for people around the world. According to <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/sites/default/files/2021-03/National%20Projections%20Brief_3.9.2021_0.pdf">Feeding America</a> (PDF), 45 million people in the US alone had no reliable access to affordable food last year, including children who lost access to school lunches. That&#39;s a 30 percent increase from 2019. The non-profit has a slightly better forecast for 2021, but it still believes 42 million people in the country — 13 million of which are children, and 1 in 5 of which are Black individuals — may experience food insecurity this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google worked with No Kid Hungry, FoodFinder and the US Department of Agriculture to add 90,000 places with free food support across 50 states on Maps. The company said it will add more locations in the future. To use the tool, you only have to go to the website, whether on a PC or on mobile, and type in your location. It will then show you the nearest food banks and pantries with their addresses, phone numbers, and the days and hours they&#39;re operational.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/83b06a80-d8b1-11eb-bbff-ddda03c058a4" style="height:942;width:733;" alt="Google" data-uuid="be40e211-db15-3f4f-b44f-c3070fda7281"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Find Food Support also houses YouTube videos showing how food insecurity affects people from all walks of life. The hope is to destigmatize food insecurity, since the stigma associated with getting help prevents people from seeking groups and organizations that can assist them in their time of need. In addition, the website contains links to food support hotlines, benefit guides per state and information for specific demographics and communities, such as seniors, families and children and military families. And in case you don&#39;t need food aid and want to help out, you can also find information on how you can donate food, time or money on the website.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-find-food-support-website-100012251.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74e55bef-4088-4b88-96f3-7a416cf57f35</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 10:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624957565</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T09:06:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3a5fdba0-d8ab-11eb-b2ff-d3d0f8c3bb67" width="1458" height="818" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nikon's Z FC mirrorless camera recalls the glory days of 35mm film]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nikon is taking a trip back to its glory days of 35mm film photography with its second Z-series APS-C (DX) mirrorless camera, <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/0629_mirrorless_01.htm">the Z FC</a>. Designed to evoke the company&#39;s famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_FM2">FM2 SLR</a> from the &#39;80s, it offers generous manual controls, including dedicated dials for shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. The decidedly retro look might also appeal to folks looking at stylish models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-fujifilm-x-t30-review.html">Fujifilm</a> and others.</p><p>Unlike Fujifilm&#39;s models, however, the Z FC has a standalone mode dial, so you won&#39;t set modes by combining settings from the ISO, shutter or aperture dials. It has a d-pad type control at the back, but (like the Z50) lacks a dedicated joystick.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/25d82640-d8a8-11eb-bded-16faa5b5abf9" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="47e357d0-369a-3f79-bf76-9504adf3147c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>The Z FC (presumably the FC stands for film camera?) isn&#39;t just about the looks and handling, though. It uses Nikon&#39;s Z mount system and shares the 20.9-megapixel sensor, Expeed 6 processor and other features with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-nikon-z50-camera-review.html">Nikon&#39;s Z50</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it adds a fully-articulating OLED (rather than LCD) display, and a significantly faster USB-C socket for transfers, charging and director power. Other physical features include a 2.36 million-dot electronic viewfinder, single SD card slot, microphone port (no headphone port) and an EN-EL25 battery that delivers up to 300 shots on a charge.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/368d0910-d8a8-11eb-bcfe-0641aab8ed2e" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="d1010e81-9968-31ac-b8d0-218d4ecd0ead"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Like the Z50, it can shoot at 11 fps with autofocus and auto-exposure enabled, with object, face and eye-tracking. However, it now lets you combine face and eye-tracking with a wide focus mode, expanding where the camera looks for a subject.&nbsp;</p><p>You can shoot oversampled 4K video using the full sensor width, and the Z FC introduces full-time eye autofocus mode while shooting video. That, combined with the fully-articulating sensor, will make the Z FC much more useful for vlogging and shooting selfies than the Z50.&nbsp;</p><p>To best take advantage of the small size and retro looks, Nikon also introduced the Nikkor Z 28mm f/2.8 (SE). It&#39;s relatively small and has a good field of view for tourist or street photography, and also offers a pleasantly retro look.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z FC arrives in late July at $960 for the body only, $1,100 with the DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR kit lens or $1,200 with the new 28mm F.2.8 (SE) lens. The latter will also be sold separately for $300, but it won&#39;t arrive until the fall.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fd9f9a0-d8a8-11eb-a757-81896a2e75e8" alt="Nikon&#39;s Z fc APS-C camera recalls its 35mm film glory days" data-uuid="17f1e74b-66ba-36a6-b200-df935c7828cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z-fc-apsc-camera-retro-chic-071315225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d5d72b3-5c8e-41e2-810e-89126d0b4736</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 07:13:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624969476</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ddb07ed0-d8d4-11eb-b5de-9c6630e67fda" width="3278" height="2249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Nikon Z FC camera seen from head on.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nikon Z FC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is reportedly using algorithms to fire Flex delivery drivers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s contract Flex delivery driver fleet already has to deal with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apologizes-for-tweets-attacking-work-conditions-192622311.html">various indignities</a>, and you can now add the fact that they can be hired — and fired — by algorithms, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-28/fired-by-bot-amazon-turns-to-machine-managers-and-workers-are-losing-out"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> report.&nbsp;</p><p>To ensure same-day and other deliveries arrive on time, Amazon uses millions of subcontracted drivers for its Flex delivery program, started in 2015. Drivers sign up via a smartphone app via which they can choose shifts, coordinate deliveries and report problems. The reliance on technology doesn&#39;t end there, though, as they&#39;re also monitored for performance and fired by algorithms with little human intervention.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, the system can often fire workers seemingly without good cause, according to the report. One worker said her rating (ranging from Fantastic, Great, Fair, or At Risk) fell after she was forced to halt deliveries due to a nail in her tire. She succeeded in boosting it to Great over the next several weeks, but her account was eventually terminated for violating Amazon&#39;s terms of service. She contested the firing, but the company wouldn&#39;t reinstate her.</p><blockquote><p>Whenever there’s an issue, there’s no support.

Drivers must pay $200 to dispute any termination, and many have said it&#39;s not worth the effort. “Whenever there’s an issue, there’s no support,” said Cope, who is 29. “It’s you against the machine, so you don’t even try.”</p><p>Inside Amazon, however, the program has been chalked up as a success, a former engineer who worked on the program told Amazon.

More than 660,000 people in the US have downloaded the app in the last five months alone.</p><p>Amazon said drivers’ claims of poor treatment and unfair termination were anecdotal and don’t represent the experience of the vast majority of Flex drivers. “We have invested heavily in technology and resources to provide drivers visibility into their standing and eligibility to continue delivering, and investigate all driver appeals,” Spokesperson&nbsp;Kate Kudrna told <em>Bloomberg</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-algorithms-fire-flex-delivery-drivers-055959081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">487b9b68-38bc-42ae-8dc5-925cff33ed7a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 05:59:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624946410</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T06:00:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cb21860-d89e-11eb-bf5e-343ec43c4eca" width="4970" height="3437" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cb21860-d89e-11eb-bf5e-343ec43c4eca" width="4970" height="3437" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[picture alliance via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[28 April 2021, Brandenburg, Kiekebusch: The logo of Amazon, (Amazon.com, Inc., listed US online mail order company), at the shipping warehouse in Kiekebusch, a district of the municipality of Schönefeld in the district of Dahme-Spreewald.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-softbank-shrinks-robotics-business-stops-pepper-production-sources-2021-06-28/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the Japanese conglomerate has stopped the robot&#39;s production last year and is slashing jobs across robotics-related businesses in several countries.

Pepper was built as a social robot that can recognize faces and basic human emotions, so it can interact with people. Most of the units SoftBank produced are leased to corporate clients, and the company also placed the robot in its mobile phone stores in Japan.</p><p>With a price of over $1,600, though, Pepper a bit too expensive for most developers and small businesses. <em>Reuters</em>&#39; sources said its sales suffered from limited functionality and unreliability. Further, SoftBank wasn&#39;t able to give the robot more features, because culture clashes between its French business in charge of robotics projects and its Tokyo management reportedly affected Pepper&#39;s development.&nbsp;</p><p>After SoftBank shifted its focus to the cleaning robot Whiz, Pepper was sidelined. The company plans to cut about half of its 330 staff positions in France in September, <em>Reuters</em> said, and half of the sales staff positions in the US and Britain had already been cut.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/softbank-stopped-production-pepper-robots-032616568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">606f21aa-980f-4020-80de-f19d1e2ab266</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 03:26:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624937164</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T03:26:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/24cb6670-d882-11eb-974d-9a541f8598cc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tatiana Dyuvbanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prague, Czech republic - February 1, 2019: The Robot consultant with digital tablet in Prague airport in Czech republic.

The judge noted that the FTC can file an amended complaint in the next 30 days.</p><p>But Judge James Boasberg said that the FTC would need to provide more evidence to back up its claims that Facebook is a monopoly. “The FTC has failed to plead enough facts to plausibly establish a necessary element of all of its Section 2 claims — namely, that Facebook has monopoly power in the market for Personal Social Networking (PSN) Services,” Boasberg wrote. “The Complaint contains nothing on that score save the naked allegation that the company has had and still has a ‘dominant share of th[at] market (in excess of 60%).’”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Separately, Judge Boasberg also <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/QXUUWZI/STATE_OF_NEW_YORK_et_al_v_FACEBOOK_INC__dcdce-20-03589__0137.0.pdf?mcid=tGE3TEOA">dismissed</a> the antitrust lawsuit against Facebook filed by attorneys general from 48 states and territories.

The social network had accused the FTC of seeking a “do-over” for acquisitions it had previously approved. In response to the FTC suit, the judge noted the agency “is on firmer ground in scrutinizing the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp.”</p><p>It’s not yet clear how the FTC will respond, but it’s hardly the end of Facebook’s antitrust woes. Congress recently introduced v, including one that would target major acquisitions like Facebook’s deals for WhatsApp and Instagram.

As far as recent computer advances go, it&#39;s one of the more noticeable upgrades you can get since they help make every interaction, including scrolling, look and feel significantly smoother. But turning up the refresh rate on your laptop&#39;s display is also a major battery drain. You can get the best of both worlds by manually switching between different refresh rates, but that&#39;s time-consuming to do and so Microsoft is introducing a new feature called&nbsp;<a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/directx/dynamic-refresh-rate/">Dynamic refresh rate</a>&nbsp;(DRR) with the first Windows 11&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-insider-preview-170004505.html">Insider preview</a></p><p>As the name suggests, DRR will lower your laptop&#39;s refresh rate to 60Hz when you&#39;re doing things like writing emails and documents and then increase it to 120Hz when inking and scrolling so that those interactions feel more instantaneous. As of today, support for the feature is mainly limited to a handful of apps from Microsoft and Adobe. For instance, your computer&#39;s refresh rate will increase to a faster refresh rate when you&#39;re inking and scrolling in Office. However, Microsoft says more apps will support the feature over time. One thing to note is DDR won&#39;t turn on while you&#39;re playing a game, so no need to worry about putting you at a disadvantage in a competitve multiplayer match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To try out DRR, you&#39;ll need a laptop that features a display with support for a variable refresh rate of at least 120Hz. You&#39;ll also need a graphics driver that supports the feature. As such, even if you have a laptop that meets the above requirements, you may not be able to enable DRR after installing the first Windows 11 Insider build. That&#39;s something Microsoft says it&#39;s working with manufacturers to address. But if your laptop has the necessary driver support, you&#39;ll find the option to turn on DRR in the Systems menu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-191145232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc44ecd2-b1aa-47b9-af52-64d6161ef461</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 19:11:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624907510</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T19:12:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/78f70d70-d842-11eb-8fea-6812c8e69064" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senator proposes law to safeguard journalists’ data from the government]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/press-shield-law-ron-wyden/2021/06/28/ddc7acd0-d808-11eb-bb9e-70fda8c37057_story.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=wp_main">proposed a new bill</a>, called the Protect Reporters from Excessive State Suppression (PRESS) Act, that would protect journalists’ data records from being seized by the government. This comes several months after the Justice Department <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/trump-justice-dept-seized-post-reporters-phone-records/2021/05/07/933cdfc6-af5b-11eb-b476-c3b287e52a01_story.html">admitted that it acquired phone and email records</a> from reporters at <em>The Washington Post</em>, <em>CNN</em> and the <em>New York Times</em> in order to identify sources.</p><p>Wyden said in a statement that there needed to be rules “protecting reporters from government surveillance” and that it should be “written into black-letter law.” He said: “The Trump administration spied on reporters it suspected of no crimes in its hunt to identify their sources and prevent the American people from learning the truth about Trump’s lawlessness and corruption.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even though Biden’s DOJ had initially defended the use of subpoenas, the president soon said it was wrong, putting a stop to the practice. Attorney General Merrick Garland had also requested new rules be put in place around cases involving reporters. He also met with executives from the aforementioned three news organizations to discuss the situation.</p><p>While most states have some form of shield law for reporters, the federal government does not. One of the problems with prior attempts at this legislation had to do with how a journalist is defined plus what kind of activities should be protected. A federal law, for example, would have to figure out how to safeguard journalist’s privacy while also protecting national security interests.&nbsp;</p><p>Wyden’s bill proposes that journalists be shielded from court-ordered disclosures of sources, but allows for exceptions if the information would prevent terrorism, identify terrorists, or if it would prevent violence or death.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senator-proposes-federal-shield-law-183325202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd69b229-e20d-4895-80ea-f3c6dfd0b72b</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 18:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624970138</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T12:35:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6eb771a0-d83e-11eb-bfe7-51d157de54f0" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Get up to 25 courses on how to code in different languages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to program isn’t a straightforward process, and it certainly can’t be mastered overnight.

While developed by Applibot, a Japanese developer best known for mobile games like&nbsp;<em>Grimoire A</em>,&nbsp;<em>Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>features contributions from those most closely associated with the series, including Yoko Taro and Keiichi Okabe.

There&#39;s no official date for the event yet either, but based on previous years it&#39;ll likely take place in August.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wear-os-one-ui-watch-unpacked-2021-171520963.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a2d22bd9-0d85-4fb7-bf40-67c34b34c1e4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:15:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624891958</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T14:52:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/51e6ad30-d81f-11eb-b1bf-c7fce1047746" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/51e6ad30-d81f-11eb-b1bf-c7fce1047746" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung (Screenshot)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung One UI Watch experience with Google apps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung One UI Watch experience with Google apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung unveils new One UI Watch experience for Wear OS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At its MWC event today, Samsung showed off its latest smartwatch interface called One UI Watch. This software will run on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">the new Wear OS, which the company co-developed with Google</a>. Those who follow Samsung closely will remember a version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-19-samsung-one-ui-update-for-older-smartwatches.html">One UI already exists for watches</a> — it&#39;s meant to make the interface between Galaxy phones and watches feel more coherent. From what we saw today, it appears the latest One UI for Wear OS will attempt to do that too. In <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/mwc-2021-samsung-new-one-ui-watch-experience/">a press release</a>, the company said &quot;One UI Watch together with the new unified platform will create an entirely new Galaxy Watch experience.&quot;</p><p>When Google announced the latest wearable platform was made in collaboration with Samsung, it shared how it learned from the Korean company how to optimize certain processes for better responsiveness and battery performance. We also saw some changes to navigation, like a double click of a physical button to switch between running apps. But we have yet to get a full breakdown of the updated OS.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Today, Samsung showed a few more details on how things will work. For example, when you install compatible apps on your phone, they&#39;ll also be downloaded onto your smartwatch. Settings from your phone will also port over to your wrist — the various clocks for different cities you&#39;ve picked will show up, while the numbers you&#39;ve blocked will remain blocked. This also works the other way around, so if you block a person from your watch, they&#39;ll also get blacklisted on your Galaxy phones. According to a video of the new UI, the layout of the watch&#39;s Settings menu will also &quot;closely reflect&quot; that on your phone.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c429ed80-d81f-11eb-b77d-e728dadefc3b" alt="A screenshot showing the new Samsung One UI Watch experience based on Wear OS." data-uuid="65b61e01-0a7d-35c4-b776-f9bd468405ac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>One of Tizen&#39;s shortcomings was a lack of third-party app support, and with the new Wear OS that opens up a whole new library of titles you can install. One UI Watch will offer the Google Play Store so you can get apps directly from your wearable. Some of the apps this brings include Couch25K, Facer, Adidas, GolfBuddy, Calm, as well as Google&#39;s apps like Maps, Messages, YouTube Music and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung and Google both also said there will be a new watch face design tool for Android developers to create more useful options that better display the data their users want at a glance.</p><p>While this is by no means an exhaustive look at the new Wear OS or One UI Watch, it gives us a better idea of what to expect. To fully experience the software, though, we&#39;ll have to wait till it rolls out to the public (or when devices ship with it) to not only see what it&#39;s like but also if it truly delivers the performance benefits that both companies have promised.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="74f49428-630c-4939-8e9d-0881cfe3ad4f"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-watch-wear-os-details-171505347.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">684332b6-2dd9-4667-96ec-cb2efe73d0f2</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624908629</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T19:36:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c42a1490-d81f-11eb-b3de-38151b0a8777" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c42a1490-d81f-11eb-b3de-38151b0a8777" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung (Screenshot)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot showing the new Samsung One UI Watch experience based on Wear OS.

The state will use the money to fund programs that prevent e-cigarette addition and to help people quit e-cigarettes.

Most social media and influencer advertising are off limits, and the company can&#39;t have ads near schools or sponsor concerts or sporting events. Juul and retailers that sell its products online will need to use an independent verification system to make sure customers are of legal age.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Juul will need to run a secret shopper program to make sure retailers aren&#39;t selling its vape pens to anyone under the age of 21. Retailers will need to keep Juul products behind their counter too. In addition, the company can&#39;t introduce new flavors or change nicotine content levels without approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).&nbsp;</p><p>“For years, Juul targeted young people, including teens, with its highly addictive e-cigarette. It lit the spark and fanned the flames of a vaping epidemic among our children – one that you can see in any high school in North Carolina,&quot; North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said <a href="https://ncdoj.gov/attorney-general-stein-reaches-agreement-with-juul-for-40-million-and-drastic-business-changes/"><ins>in a statement</ins></a>. “This win will go a long way in keeping Juul products out of kids’ hands, keeping its chemical vapor out of their lungs, and keeping its nicotine from poisoning and addicting their brains.&quot;</p><p>A Juul spokesperson sent the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>This settlement is consistent with our ongoing effort to reset our company and its relationship with our stakeholders, as we continue to combat underage usage and advance the opportunity for harm reduction for adult smokers. Importantly, we look forward to working with Attorney General Stein and other manufacturers on the development of potential industry-wide marketing practices based on science and evidence. In addition, we support the Attorney General’s desire to deploy funds to generate appropriate science to support North Carolina’s public health interventions to reduce underage use.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We seek to continue to earn trust through action. Over the past two years, for example, we ceased the distribution of our non-tobacco, non-menthol flavored products in advance of FDA guidance and halted all mass market product advertising. This settlement is another step in that direction.</p></blockquote><p>Stein started investigating Juul in 2018 and sued the company the following year for &quot;designing, marketing, and selling its e-cigarettes to attract young people and for misrepresenting the potency and danger of nicotine in its products.&quot; More than a dozen other states have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-19-juul-lawsuit-new-york-attorney-general.html"><ins>sued Juul</ins></a> for similar reasons, though the North Carolina case is the first to reach a resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-ftc-lawsuit-juul.html"><ins>filed a lawsuit</ins></a> against Juul, Marlboro owner Altria and others with the aim of undoing a 2018 investment that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-20-juul-altria-investment-vaping-big-tobacco.html"><ins>gave Altria a 35 percent stake</ins></a> in the vape pen maker. The agency argues that agreements between the two companies stifled competition and violated antitrust laws.

YouTube has partnered with Hollywood Park, a near 300-acre mega development in Inglewood, California, to host a massive live venue.&nbsp;</p><p>The &quot;YouTube Theater&quot; will be a three-story, 6,000 seater arena for performances that range from traditional concerts to the type of events you&#39;d associate with its namesake. Think eSports and creator and community shows for the site&#39;s dedicated contingent of gamers and vloggers. Maybe the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles Chargers — whose 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium is in the same complex — will also drop in. Naturally, all those gigs, meetups and tourneys will feed back into the company&#39;s main platform, creating fodder for livestreamed and on-demand content that users will be able to watch on YouTube proper.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/606e9980-d801-11eb-96f5-728460b45776" alt="YouTube Theater" data-uuid="8f73acb2-4c69-33a5-a0f9-f3d8f027b78b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">YouTube</div></figure><p>The Hollywood Park project has already corralled an eclectic bunch of pop stars to perform at the YouTube Theater with the help of Live Nation. Pitbull, Black Pumas, Devo, Trippie Redd and Marina and the Diamonds will all grace the venue through this year and the next.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Formerly a historic racetrack frequented by Hollywood royalty, the site is being converted into a massive mixed-use development, home to almost 3,000 apartments, a sports stadium, a 300-room hotel and an 890,000-square-foot retail area. Construction on the theater is scheduled to be completed this summer.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be a YouTube event without some social interaction. In that vein, the venue will feature a massive exterior screen that guests can mirror themselves on and view clips through. Google could also use it to highlight the same products it sells at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-store-nyc-chelsea-open-tour-140001787.html">newly opened debut retail store</a> in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube isn&#39;t the first video service to broach live events, though the scale here may be unmatched by its closest rivals. Take Netflix: The world&#39;s biggest streamer owns <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-25-netflix-save-new-york-paris-theatre.html">New York&#39;s iconic Paris movie theater</a> and has previously organized <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-netflix-is-a-joke-comedy-festival.html">live comedy events</a>. Disney and the rest of Hollywood, meanwhile, regularly turn up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/san-diego-comic-con-at-home-000423761.html">Comic-Con</a> to promote their biggest blockbusters. YouTube&#39;s heavyweight creators — who run the gamut from pranksters to serial toy openers to beauty and makeup experts — will likely be chomping at the bit for a chance to take to the theater&#39;s 6,100 square-foot stage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-theater-live-arena-california-160056935.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1412157-7758-4701-9045-bf2aacca66df</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 28 Jun 2021 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624914962</ingested><modified>2021-06-28T21:16:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b89a8c0-d800-11eb-bb7e-2a1ed9e09dc5" width="2250" height="1269" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b89a8c0-d800-11eb-bb7e-2a1ed9e09dc5" width="2250" height="1269" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube Theater]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube Theater]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
