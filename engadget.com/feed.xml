The first, nicknamed Genoa, is built for general-purpose computing and packs up to 96 cores (thanks in part to a 5nm process) as well as support for DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 peripherals. It arrives sometime in 2022, and partners are sampling chips now.</p><p>The star of the show, however, may be Bergamo. It&#39;s designed for cloud computing and emphasizes core density — AMD is promising up to 128 cores in a single CPU. The design relies on a modified Zen 4c architecture (the C is for &quot;cloud&quot;) that offers similar functionality, but optimizes cache and power consumption to boost the core count and offer as many processing threads as possible. Bergamo doesn&#39;t surface until the first half of 2023, but it may be useful for internet giants juggling many simultaneous users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you were expecting news on Zen 4-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-5700g-5600g-apu-radeon-sale-030010401.html">Ryzen processors</a>, you&#39;ll be disappointed.

Batteries, capacity overbuilding and other storage options could increase that figure.</p><p>A blend of wind and solar power should be enough to meet most of the current energy needs in &quot;advanced, industrialized nations,&quot; <a href="https://news.uci.edu/2021/11/05/wind-and-solar-could-power-the-worlds-major-countries-most-of-the-time/"><ins>according to the study</ins></a>. Researchers from the University of California, Irvine (UCI), China’s Tsinghua University, the Carnegie Institution for Science and Caltech looked at 39 years of hourly energy demand data from 42 countries to determine whether there&#39;s enough wind and solar resources to meet requirements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They found that most reliable systems, in which wind power is most prevalent, can meet energy needs in the countries they studied between 72 and 91 percent of the time, and that&#39;s before any storage considerations. Add the capacity to store up to 12 hours&#39; worth of energy, and these renewable energy sources can meet between 83 and 94 percent of hourly energy needs. However, the researchers noted even when wind and solar sources can power over 90 percent of a region&#39;s energy needs, there would still be hundreds of hours per year where demand isn&#39;t met.</p><p>“Wind and solar could meet more than 80 percent of demand in many places without crazy amounts of storage or excess generating capacity, which is the critical point,” co-author Steven Davis, professor of Earth system science at UCI, said. “But depending on the country, there may be many multi-day periods throughout the year when some demand will need to be met by energy storage and other non-fossil energy sources in a zero-carbon future.”</p><p>There are geophysical challenges at play. The paper suggests it would be easier for larger countries closer to the equator to fully switch to sustainable power sources, since they can more reliably bank on having solar energy all year long. Germany, for instance, might struggle to meet most of its needs through wind and solar, since it&#39;s a relatively smaller country at a higher latitude.</p><p>One solution would be for neighboring countries to pool their resources. &quot;A lot of consistency and reliability could be provided by a system that includes solar resources from Spain, Italy and Greece with bountiful wind available in the Netherlands, Denmark and the Baltic region,&quot; Dan Tong, assistant professor of Earth system science at Tsinghua University and lead author on the paper, said.</p><p>Many countries are cutting back on their reliance on fossil fuels, which is key to mitigating carbon emissions and limiting the impact of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/climate%20change/"><ins>climate change</ins></a>.

For gadget-lovers who seemingly have everything, or someone getting an exciting new piece of hardware this holiday, digital gifts can help them get even more out of things they own and love. This year, we’re including time-tested music and TV streaming services, some game subscriptions and practical options like learning services to keep your brain both calm and limber just as the new year gets here.</p><h2>Apple One</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ede1dc70-40a0-11ec-bfc7-ee12a44a9696" alt="Apple One" data-uuid="60d0181a-e53e-3ad7-bfc6-49e32b9ac287"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If you know someone with multiple Apple devices, chances are good they’re already paying for a little bit of iCloud storage, and maybe a few other Apple services like Music or Arcade as well. If that’s the case, consider gifting them an <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/">Apple One subscription</a>. In a single monthly charge, Apple offers a combo of Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and either 50GB, 200GB, or 2TB of iCloud storage. If you spring for the $19.95 Family plan, that 200GB can be shared with five other family members. The $29.95 plan adds subscriptions to Apple News+ and Apple Fitness+ too. At this point, all of Apple’s offerings are pretty good – Arcade has a load of fun games with no ads, TV+ has <em>Ted Lasso</em>, and Music is second only to Spotify in the streaming world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-one/" id="645f80b10ff34bdc8377ae38c6499ee5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Apple;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy Apple One starting at $15</a><h2>Xbox Game Pass</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d6655e0-409d-11ec-aff1-a35f96e25474" alt="Microsoft Xbox Game Pass Ultimate

But if you know someone who managed to get their hands on Microsoft&#39;s latest console, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Xbox Game Pass" href="https://fave.co/3v6Xg80">Xbox Game Pass</a> is an outstanding addition to their new console. A $15/month subscription offers more than 100 games that can be played on the Xbox or PC, and they can be streamed to phones and tablets as well.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate also includes a number of other perks, including Xbox Live Gold. That&#39;s usually $10 a month on its own, and it&#39;s a requirement if you want to play games online. It also includes EA Play, which opens up access to more games for the Xbox and PC. Perhaps the best part of Xbox Game Pass, though, is that it offers access to first-party Xbox Game Studios titles the day they&#39;re released, so you don&#39;t even have to purchase them. For an Xbox owner, it&#39;s a no-brainer. If the person you’re shopping for is a PlayStation owner, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation Now" href="https://amzn.to/3ws4qo9">PlayStation Now</a> offers access to hundreds of streaming games for $60/year (or $10/month), while <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nintendo&#x002019;s Switch Online" href="https://amzn.to/30d7Tv3">Nintendo’s Switch Online</a> unlocks online play and a large selection of NES, Super NES, Sega Genesis and N64 games for $50/year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3v6Xg80" id="9100bac04e624a80b78f95273fff9044" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Xbox Game Pass at Microsoft - $15/month</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ws4qo9" id="cabae3e9c23d4f45ad336febf51c2f68" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PS Now (12 months) at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30d7Tv3" id="6d2709de7df34bfd97b96859b2d32c6d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Switch Online (12 months) at Amazon - $20</a><h2>YouTube Premium</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d643301-409d-11ec-bffe-bb6907afbdd4" alt="YouTube Premium

Shrewdly, YouTube offers a solution. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/premium">$12/month subscription</a> removes the ads, but there are a number of other benefits as well. If you&#39;re watching on a phone or tablet, you can download basically any video and save it for offline playback. Videos also can play in the background, which means you can switch to other apps without stopping. This comes in handy for picture-in-picture, or if you just want to hear the audio while you switch away to send a text message.</p><p>Premium also comes with a subscription to YouTube Music, the company&#39;s competitor to Spotify and Apple Music. It&#39;s a pretty solid service, and it does a few things that Apple and Spotify can&#39;t offer. For example, all of YouTube&#39;s music video content lives alongside its standard streaming catalog, which means users can build playlists that combine videos uploaded to YouTube alongside official artist releases. For $12, the combination of a better YouTube experience and a full-fledged music streaming app is a pretty good deal.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.youtube.com/premium" id="12e28dbb30a746c8bf49a735606ceaf9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:YouTube;elmt:other;pdid:">Buy YouTube Premium - $12/month</a><h2>The Disney Bundle</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d643300-409d-11ec-bffb-2c3b0c0383c4" alt="The Disney Bundle, showing logos and images of popular shows." data-uuid="a12ea77f-afa5-39da-9765-abb796085364"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney&#39;s $14/month video bundle" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/mgE321">Disney&#39;s $14/month video bundle</a> that includes Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu is a great digital gift for basically anyone who likes good entertainment. The appeal of Disney+ is well-known at this point: it includes basically all of Disney and Pixar&#39;s classic animated films, alongside basically everything in the Marvel cinematic universe, the entire<em> Star Wars</em> saga, and new original shows like <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>The Bad Batch</em> and more.</p><p>Hulu offers a vast slate of current and classic TV shows, a solid rotating selection of feature films, and a growing roster of originals.

ESPN+, meanwhile, offers a host of live sports, including MLB games every day of the season, a wide variety of soccer leagues, golf, tennis and college games across multiple sports. Add in ESPN&#39;s <em>30 for 30</em> documentary library and a smattering of originals and the Disney bundle ends up being a great option for almost anyone — and it’s only $6 more than Disney+ on its own.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/mgE321" id="094b2a3512824c5aa4bd1ed46b3b5a49" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Disney Bundle - $14/month</a><h2>HBO Max</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d601450-409d-11ec-bffa-694b94a492f3" alt="HBO Max" data-uuid="489f82eb-f6eb-396c-a4a3-fae990840f4f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HBO Max</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HBO Max" href="https://fave.co/3dZW91S">HBO Max</a> might not have the best app we&#39;ve ever used, but it does have one of the biggest and best video libraries you can find. Its collection of original shows and films is still unrivaled in a lot of ways, from classics like <em>The Wire</em> and <em>The Sopranos</em> to newer hits like <em>Mare of Easttown</em> and <em>Succession</em>. The service also has a huge movie library, and lately it’s offered a number of movies at the same time as their theatrical release. For example, <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> is going to hit HBO Max just a few days before Christmas and will stream there for a month. Speaking of new HBO content, <em>Curb your Enthusiasm</em> is coming back to HBO for an 11th season this fall. And if you&#39;re a DC fan, HBO Max has all of the classic Batman movies (including the Dark Knight Trilogy and Michael Keaton&#39;s two films) as well as more recent films like <em>Aquaman</em>, <em>Wonder Woman</em> and, of course, the infamous Synder Cut of <em>Justice League</em>.

It can heat up to 20 gallons of water using 1,200 watts of power. Anova says the device can run for up to 10,000 hours before shutting down. It&#39;s a fairly sturdy machine too. The Precision Cooker Pro is made with stainless steel and should withstand accidental drops. It&#39;s IPX-7 rated as well, so if you dunk it in water by mistake, it should still work.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anova-sous-vide-precision-cooker-pro-half-price-amazon-good-deal-150721840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">324afad7-4d7e-44ce-b240-d5b590dfe8ee</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 15:07:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636383808</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T15:03:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/eaf13e10-ab0b-11ea-bf3f-a50ab0e0075d" width="960" height="631" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/eaf13e10-ab0b-11ea-bf3f-a50ab0e0075d" width="960" height="631" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anova]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anova Sous Vide]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anova Sous Vide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a seven-mile delivery loop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-gatik-pilot-expansion-222524778.html">promised</a>, Walmart has started doing fully driverless box truck deliveries in partnership with startup Gatik between its own locations on a fixed 7-mile loop, the companies <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211108005409/en/Gatik-and-Walmart-Achieve-Fully-Driverless-Deliveries-in-a-First-for-Autonomous-Trucking-Industry-Worldwide">announced</a>.

Doing so means smaller warehouses, so &quot;there is a growing need for doing repeated trips from the fulfilment centers to the pickup points,&quot; Gatik CEO Gautam Narang told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/walmart-is-using-fully-driverless-trucks-to-ramp-up-its-online-grocery-business.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. &quot;That&#39;s where we come in.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart isn&#39;t the first superstore to go fully driverless, as Kroger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-18-kroger-adds-driverless-vehicles-grocery-delivery-fleet.html">teamed up</a> with self-driving startup Nuro for grocery deliveries back in 2018. However, at launch, Nuro&#39;s delivery vehicles were tiny microvans, while Walmart and Gatik are using full-sized box trucks.&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart and Gatik are running similar trials around New Orleans with electric box trucks, delivering directly to a customer pickup location. However, those are currently being operated with safety drivers aboard, so the Arkansas trial is the first truly driverless route. &quot;Our deployment in Bentonville is not a one-time demonstration,&quot; said Narang. &quot;These are frequent, revenue-generating, daily runs that our trucks are completing safely in a range of conditions on public roads, demonstrating the commercial and technical advantages of fully driverless operations on the middle mile.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/walmart-is-using-driverless-trucks-to-complete-a-7-mile-delivery-loop-143016425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb60afd1-2308-4f1b-a3fe-d6e99748f60e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:28:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636405014</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T20:56:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/787fe940-409b-11ec-bd57-de7044171ae2" width="1800" height="1070" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/787fe940-409b-11ec-bd57-de7044171ae2" width="1800" height="1070" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Walmart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a 7-mile delivery loop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Walmart is using driverless trucks to complete a 7-mile delivery loop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[These are the audio gadgets to gift this season]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="4956f6ff4564460fb197d68143ba1619"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/47D6BSj-gPY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The holidays are always a good time to help someone upgrade their audio setup, whether that’s earbuds, headphones, speakers or something else.

THX says the AAA-78 makes the Onyx just as powerful as a desktop DAC or amplifier setup, but it&#39;s much smaller. The chip reduces three types of distortion by up to 40dB and maximizes output power for more dynamic range and sound pressure level (SPL).

The 1.90:1 IMAX aspect ratio will look up to 26 percent taller than the typical 2.35:1 widescreen format in Marvel films, so those annoying black bars will almost disappear while you&#39;re watching scenes shot in IMAX. (You&#39;ll still see some slight bars, though, as the IMAX format doesn&#39;t completely fill 16x9 widescreen TVs.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-9f6c-2e83d138eada" alt="Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi" data-uuid="b1ab7d32-b914-3998-890d-2dca4e2c87cf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><p>Before this Disney+ partnership, IMAX and DTS brought the &quot;<a href="https://www.imaxenhanced.com/">IMAX Enhanced</a>&quot; home viewing format to a handful of TV streaming apps, like Sony&#39;s Bravia Core. IMAX-ified films will have a prominent label on their Disney+ screens, and you&#39;ll also be able to launch the standard widescreen version if you prefer. Physical Blu-ray collectors are already used to shifting IMAX aspect ratios in some films, most notably <em>The Dark Knight, Tenet</em> and <em>Mission Impossible: Fallout</em>, but streaming films have typically lost on this perk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expanded aspect ratio should give Marvel&#39;s action sequences more room to pop on your TV, and it&#39;s a feature Disney+ can lord over its streaming competitors. You&#39;ll also see a wider image on smartphones, PCs and anywhere else you can view Disney+. Technically, IMAX Enhanced isn&#39;t delivering the large film format&#39;s true aspect ratio, which is more square. But, as we saw with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zack-snyder-justice-league-hbo-max-fandom-133004404.html"><em>Zack Snyder&#39;s Justice League</em></a>, that leads to enormous (and ugly) black bars on the sides of your TV. It&#39;s also worth noting that we won&#39;t see IMAX versions of <em>The Avengers</em> and <em>Ant-Man</em>, as those are the rare Marvel films that used the <a href="https://neiloseman.com/aspect-ratio-and-the-marvel-cinematic-universe/">TV-filling 1.85:1 aspect ratio</a> (a choice made to convey a better sense of height).</p><p>Looking ahead, IMAX Enhanced will also bring immersive DTS sound to Disney+, a competing option to the more ubiquitous Dolby Atmos format. Representatives from all of the companies involved tell us that IMAX Enhanced films will also support Dolby Vision, HDR10, 4K (naturally) and Dolby Atmos sound.</p><div id="0b210c1353014c708d6ef52e0cc27d54"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uxOvXM7eBc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Here are all the IMAX Enhanced films <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney;elmt:impact radius;pdid:arriving on Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/vnQPzv">arriving on Disney+</a> on November 12th:</p><ul><li><p><em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Infinity War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Panther</em></p></li><li><p><em>Black Widow</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></p></li><li><p><em>Captain Marvel</em></p></li><li><p><em>Doctor Strange</em></p></li><li><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy 1 &amp; 2</em></p></li><li><p><em>Iron Man</em></p></li><li><p><em>Thor Ragnarok</em></p></li><li><p><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em><br><br></p></li></ul>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7cee7ad-53b0-47dd-9848-586b0c78f603</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636385020</ingested><modified>2021-11-08T15:23:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/983b81f0-4054-11ec-bab7-e1cc086c7184" width="1283" height="691" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Shang-Chi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ IMAX Enhanced Marvel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops to a new record low of $800]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update 1:42pm ET:</strong> Amazon&#39;s deal on the MacBook Air M1 has expired.</p><p>Even with the high-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">MacBook Pros</a> now available, we still consider the MacBook Air M1 to be the best Apple laptop for most people.

Now, it has released the three-axis Crane M3 designed for mirrorless cameras, with some interesting new features like a tiny LED light and a built-in screen.</p><p>The Crane M3 is about the size of a water bottle and offers tilt, roll and pan axes with locks for each. It works with smartphones and 90 percent of mirrorless cameras, Zhiyun notes. It has a smart new white and black chassis that the company says delivers a better gripping and user experience. It also offers upgraded motors with stronger torque than the original Crane 3.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A key feature is the quick-release design with different plates that lets you change rapidly between different sized cameras (action and mirrorless, for instance), without the need to rebalance. It also has a quarter-inch adapter so you can connect a professional microphone to an expansion base and run a second cable to the camera. A mic or other accessory can then be attached to a quarter-inch threaded expansion port. Zhiyun is even selling its own shotgun mic in one of the packages, or you can connect other models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/911b26b0-4080-11ec-8ffa-7ddd55b8d1cd" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="0726ed00-9cdc-3e43-9cc2-e0701e53a686"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>The most noticeable feature, though, is an 800-lumen 6 watt dual-color LED light. It&#39;s designed for &quot;impromptu low-light shooting,&quot; Zhiyun notes, with full stepless dimming control and temperature settings via a control wheel. The light is softened with a translucent filter, though it&#39;s largely designed for run-and-gun shooting.</p><p>Other features include Bluetooth (or USB-C) control of supported cameras and a joystick and wheel to control, roll axis, aperture, shutter and ISO. If you&#39;d rather not set controls using the smartphone app, it also offers a 1.22-inch full-color interactive touchscreen to change mode settings (portrait, vortex and go modes), as well as follow speed. It also shows camera operational status, gimbal connection and battery levels.&nbsp;</p><p>Zhiyun sent me a unit to try out, complete with the expansion plate, so I attached a Panasonic GH5 II. While some functions weren&#39;t working (like the camera app), it was one of the easier gimbals to balance that I&#39;ve tried and it&#39;s certainly easy to detach and attach the camera using the quick release plates. The ability to connect a microphone away from the camera is also smart, reducing complexity and rebalancing, though you&#39;d need some accessories to attach a decent-sized microphone.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7d91ee30-4080-11ec-affc-d20b758f54b4" style="height:1088;width:1920;" alt="Zhiyun&#39;s three-axis camera gimbal houses an LED light and small display" data-uuid="32511dbb-0ae7-3f86-845d-aa88a521b71a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zhiyun</div></figure><p>Operation was smooth, with controls well placed for manual operations. The touchscreen was nice, though it&#39;s relatively easy to hit it by mistake — I did so once and accidentally changed the language. The lighting feature works great in a pinch, but because of the small size, it casts some harsh shadows.

The hard way, apparently. In his &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on/">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman (with help from developer Steve Moser) claimed to have seen code indicating Netflix would release all its games &quot;individually&quot; on iOS, through the App Store. They won&#39;t all be downloadable and playable within the app, Gurman added.</p><p>The main Netflix app would still offer access to the game catalog, but you&#39;d merely be launching a separate app when you tap a game. That&#39;s currently how it works with Android, but Netflix has the option of folding games into its Android app. On iOS, it would have no choice but to make games available separately. Apple requires that every game on the App Store receive an individual screening, even if it&#39;s only available through the cloud.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You could see this coming in light of Apple&#39;s approach, but it still indicates that Netflix will have to make some compromises if it&#39;s going to bring mobile games to iOS. This also underscores a growing rivalry between Apple and Netflix, as Gurman explained. The two are competing on an increasing number of fronts, ranging from gaming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">streaming video services</a>, but neither can afford to estrange the other. The potential exists for a significant conflict, especially if Apple has to make further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">concessions on App Store rules</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ios-games-app-store-212712803.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30a531f0-e3a2-40c8-9707-78ca14cf0dc1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 21:27:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636320434</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T21:27:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ad850050-400d-11ec-b6f3-b7c64a3162d2" width="5000" height="2764" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ad850050-400d-11ec-b6f3-b7c64a3162d2" width="5000" height="2764" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/11/04: In this photo illustration, the Netflix Games logo seen displayed on a smartphone on top of a keyboard.

There may be an explanation for that momentary anguish, though. Google is <a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1457043416139898881">telling</a> users that the Pixel 6&#39;s fingerprint reader is using &quot;enhanced security algorithms&quot; that may either take longer to check your digits or require better sensor contact.</p><p>Google hasn&#39;t elaborated on its statement.

However, Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qoayk3/made_by_google_the_pixel_6_fingerprint_sensor/">noted</a> there are phones with optical sensors that perform faster, such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9</a>. There&#39;s a real chance software may play a role in the Pixel 6&#39;s quirks.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain if Google can or will address this through a software update. Whether or not it can, it&#39;s unlikely to provide an alternative beyond entering your passcode. Face unlock is typically insecure without a depth sensor present, as facial recognition systems can sometimes be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-facial-recognition-fooled-masks.html">fooled by masks</a> and photos.

According to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/iraqi-prime-minister-survives-assassination-attempt-mustafa-al-kadhimi-drone/"><em>CBS News</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqi-pm-chairs-security-meeting-after-drone-attack-residence-2021-11-07/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi says he survived a drone-based assassination attempt today (November 7th) at his home in Baghdad&#39;s highly secure Green Zone. The country&#39;s Interior Ministry said the attack involved three drones, including at least one bomb-laden vehicle. Six bodyguards were injured during the incident, and an official speaking talking to <em>Reuters</em> claimed security forces obtained the remnants of a small drone at the scene.</p><p>While the Iraqi government publicly said it was &quot;premature&quot; to identify culprits, <em>CBS</em> sources suspected the perpetrators belonged to pro-Iranian militias that have used similar tactics against Erbil International Airport and the US Embassy. The militias directly blamed al-Kadhimi for casualties in a fight between Iraqi security forces and pro-militia protesters who objected to their side&#39;s losses in an October 10th parliamentary vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Iraq, the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran have publicly condemned the attack. Militia leaders, however, suggested the drone attack might have been faked to distract from protesters&#39; reported deaths.</p><p>Drone-based terrorism isn&#39;t a completely novel concept. ISIS, for instance, modified off-the-shelf drones to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-16-isis-drones-weaponized-bombers-iraq-mosul.html">drop explosives</a>. Attacks against political leaders are still very rare, though. If accurate, the reported Iraqi plot suggests drone terrorism is entering a new phase — extremists are using robotic fliers to hit major targets too dangerous to strike using conventional methods.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iraq-prime-minister-drone-assassination-attempt-182450389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5321a3a6-8c38-42be-9899-f00c2d5dc6ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 18:24:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636316874</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T20:28:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unrest, Conflicts & War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Armed Forces]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A destroyed vehicle is parked in front of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi's residence following an assassination attempt by an armed drone in Baghdad, Iraq in this screen grab taken from a handout video obtained by Reuters on November 7, 2021.

The details of the lobbying weren&#39;t revealed in the public disclosure, but the description suggested you would hail a taxi from the Uber app like you could in the company&#39;s earlier days.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Uber for comment, although it declined to speak to <em>The Post</em>. A TLC spokesperson shied away from discussing details, saying only that the Commission &quot;meets frequently&quot; with licensees to explore ideas and that it was focused on relief efforts for drivers struggling with taxi medallion debt.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yellow cab hailing might seem an unusual choice for a company that has routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">clashed with the taxi industry</a> and is frequently blamed for gutting NYC&#39;s cab demand. Uber would likely have to rethink its commissions to compensate taxi drivers who pay steep costs to operate in the city, and it could still face political opposition given its history.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to see why Uber might consider offering NYC taxis. The revival would increase the chances of passengers scoring some kind of ride through the Uber app, even if there aren&#39;t enough ridesharing drivers to go around. That could keep New Yorkers using the Uber app and increase the chances they&#39;ll use the company&#39;s more familiar options.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-new-york-city-yellow-taxi-cab-dispatch-171021741.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24e6d4dd-15a1-4c62-a045-5b018a5ae940</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636305024</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T17:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VIEW press via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 16: Yellow cabs and Uber car drive through Times Square on November 16, 2020 in New York City.

They deliver a balanced sound with an adaptive EQ (to optimize for your ear) and solid active noise cancellation. You can expect healthy battery life, convenient controls and tight integration with Apple devices — the usual setup and device switching headaches won&#39;t be an issue. They&#39;ve become more valuable over time, too. Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">Apple Music offers spatial audio</a>, you can immerse yourself in songs that take advantage of the all-enveloping sound stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some familiar caveats still apply.

And you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-explained-153046070.html">can&#39;t listen to lossless Apple Music</a> audio even when you&#39;re plugged in. With that said, the sale price makes the AirPods Max considerably easier to justify if you have an Apple device and enjoy the eye-catching design.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-max-amazon-sale-152046687.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3b9e500-dc97-4c75-985b-f59cae470753</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 15:20:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636298448</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T15:20:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/17562490-3fd8-11ec-8def-c00341fc7065" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/17562490-3fd8-11ec-8def-c00341fc7065" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max headphones in Sky Blue]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max headphones in Sky Blue]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
