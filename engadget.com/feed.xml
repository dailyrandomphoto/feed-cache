Now, you&#39;ve got plenty more ways to upgrade your Xbox experience. Maybe you need a better controller to optimize your <em>Psychonauts 2 </em>runs, a clearer headset to chat with teammates in <em>Apex Legends</em>, or perhaps your storage is just running low. Here are a few of the best Xbox accessories you can nab today.</p><h2>Controllers: Go stylish, go Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a2ae1090-5c23-11ec-bfaf-4f3d53cb094b" alt="Microsoft Xbox Elite gamepad" data-uuid="417eb709-928d-32ca-8104-a3bf805a3bec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>It&#39;s always smart to have a second controller on hand.

And at the very least, it&#39;s wise to have a replacement in case something goes wrong with your main controller.

The <em>League of Legends</em> publisher was only going to pay $10 million per the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-riot-games-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement.html">preliminary settlement</a> in 2019, but the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing went to court to block the agreement. $10 million was much too small, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">agency argued</a>, and the women suing the company could be entitled to as much as $400 million.</p><p>The lawsuit was originally filed by Melanie McCracken and Jess Negrón after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-the-culture-of-sexism-at-riot-games-1828165483"><em>Kotaku report</em></a> exposed the developers&#39; &quot;men-first&quot; and &quot;bro&quot; company culture. In the report, <em>Kotaku</em> detailed employees&#39; experiences within the company, such as instances of &quot;genital grabbing&quot; and senior leaders passing around lists of employees they would sleep with. One former employee who left the company due to sexism said working for Riot was like &quot;working at a giant fraternity.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the terms of the settlement, $80 million will go towards members of the class-action lawsuit, while $20 million will go towards the plaintiffs&#39; legal fees. All employees and contractors in California who identify as women and who worked at Riot between November 2014 until present day qualify for a payout. Those who&#39;ve been with the company longer will get a bigger cut than newer workers. And there are quite a lot of newer ones — while only around 1,000 workers were qualified for a payout in 2019, there are now around 2,300 eligible personnel. In a statement, the developer told <em>The Washington Post</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Three years ago, Riot was at the heart of what became a reckoning in our industry. We had to face the fact that despite our best intentions, we hadn’t always lived up to our values. As a company we stood at a crossroads; we could deny the shortcomings of our culture, or we could apologize, correct course, and build a better Riot. We chose the latter... While we&#39;e proud of how far we’ve come since 2018, we must also take responsibility for the past. We hope that this settlement properly acknowledges those who had negative experiences at Riot.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to paying $100 million, Riot Games is also required to get a third-party expert to conduct &quot;sex/gender equity analysis of total compensation, assignment and promotion outcomes for California employees.&quot; Riot must also allow pay transparency and will have to be monitored by a third party, who&#39;ll keep an eye on things like HR complaints and pay equity, for three years. The monitor will be able to recommend changes to the company that Riot can implement.&nbsp;</p><p>Genie Harrison, the women&#39;s rights attorney who represented the plaintiffs, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This is a great day for the women of Riot Games – and for women at all video game and tech companies – who deserve a workplace that is free of harassment and discrimination. We appreciate Riot’s introspection and work since 2018 toward becoming a more diverse and inclusive company, its willingness to take responsibility for its past, and its commitment to fairness and equality in the future. Along with the DFEH and DLSE, the brave women of Riot who carried the torch of justice have achieved a precedent-setting result that stands as a beacon for other women and as a warning that employers had better pay and treat women fairly, or else be held accountable.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-settles-class-action-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-100049078.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">07da685d-47bb-44b2-8348-eb293c01ae84</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 10:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640683318</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T09:22:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/3f2636a0-3d6d-11ea-baff-e0246a76426a" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dania Maxwell via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 06: Workers at Riot Games listen to a speaker during a staged walk out at Riot Games to protest the company's move to force arbitration on sexual harassment lawsuits on May 6, 2019, in Los Angeles, California.

Augmented, virtual and mixed reality wearables have been consistently positioned as one of the primary beneficiaries of the speed and latency enhancements promised by 5G networks.

The <a href="https://grellaudio.com/en/product/1/in-ear-headphones-tws-1-space-grey">TWS/1</a> is his first solo product under the Grell brand. Accordingly, we’re interested to see what the $200 wireless buds can do.</p><p>The TWS/1 has a modern look. The mostly circular design is only interrupted by a small, AirPod-like protuberance on each bud. Originally the plan was to have the outer casing entirely metal but physics and radio waves meant that some concessions (plastic parts) were needed. Overall, they maintain a premium feel that stands above that often found at this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html">price</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-tws-zne01-anc-fwd02-sport-140056623.html">point</a>. They visually remind me slightly of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Jabra Elite 75t</a>, but a little lower profile.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In terms of fit, that slightly more streamlined design means you don’t feel like something is balancing in your ear which can sometimes happen with more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html">rotund models</a>. As per usual they come with a charging case that promises four full charges of the TWS/1. The buds themselves offer around 6 hours per charge which holds true in my experience with ANC activated. Curiously, the buds are placed in the case with the right one to the left and vice versa. I’m not sure why this would be, but it does take some remembering (you’ll soon be reminded as the buds don’t fit the other way around).</p><p>In a world of me-too products, it’s hard to stand out. The easiest differentiator is price, then sound quality and or additional/premium features. It seems Grell Audio has tried to tackle all three of these, and with general success, I would say.</p><p>The price point puts the TWS/1 in an unusual category. Many premium brands are landing in the $250+ zone while more affordable options, like Google’s second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-2020-160030712.html">Pixel Buds</a> or the aforementioned Jabra’s live in the $150 area. Budget options, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">south of $100</a>, are also increasingly more common. This, then, pitches the TWS/1 at the overlap between high-mid and low-premium. I would wager this is entirely intentional as feature set and build quality skew higher end, but the barebones packaging and more accessible price indicate a more mainstream audience.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0f6c36c0-671f-11ec-bef1-df948f128588" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="bceea645-9345-3ff0-b8db-128f315bfb8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for sound quality, this is where things are a little more clear. In my testing, I was generally pleased with the default sound. It was perhaps a little on the thinner side for my personal preference with a slight weight on the lower end for a typically commercial sound. But Grell has partnered with SoundID – a third-party app that tunes select brands of headphones to your personal preference/hearing.</p><p>We’ve seen things like this before, most notably with Nura which takes this to a whole new level. SoundID is a little more understated in its approach. It still uses some form of hearing test, but rather than asking if you can hear certain tones, it simply plays you some music and asks “which do you prefer, A or B.” Once I completed this short test, the difference was night and day. With my own personal profile activated (it uploads to the headphones so it applies no matter what you are listening on), my usual mix of mid ‘10s indie and rave nonsense came alive.</p><p>I have a slight preference for dynamic range and beefier low and mid-high frequencies. At least, I presume I do because that was the biggest change in sound after completing the test and I instantly found them much more enjoyable. In the SoundID app, you can toggle between the default sound and your own profile and it really does make a huge difference. You don’t <em>need</em> the app to get good sound, but I’m going to guess that you’ll be happier with what it gives you.</p><p>Coincidentally, SoundID is also where you’ll get software updates for the TWS/1. I had one during my testing and it improved a few things including the slightly unresponsive touch controls. They’re still not reading my taps 1:1 but its about on par with most other touch-control buds I have used. Before the update, it was much more frustrating (or, maybe I just learned the technique?).</p><p>Those controls aren’t user-configurable, so you’re stuck with what Grell gives you. But, fortunately, that’s pretty much everything you’d want and without too many complicated tap or gesture combinations. Swiping forward or back on the left ear skips tracks, up or down on the right for volume, and so on. It was the single taps that I was having issues with which control play/pause on the right and transparency mode on the left – both of which are more annoying if not activated immediately.</p><p>This brings us on to smart(er) features. As mentioned, the TWS/1 has Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode – both of which are becoming increasingly standard. But there’s also a Noise Annoyance Reduction (NAR) mode. Grell explained to me during their initial announcement briefing that ANC is great for lower-frequency sustained noises, but doesn’t work as well for higher-frequency annoyances (think, crying baby on a plane). NAR is Grell’s own attempt at offering some reduction of these types of sound.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2e4d2ea0-671f-11ec-9fbf-1df5e18a8ea7" alt="Grell Audio TWS/1." data-uuid="fb8ed1cd-6db0-3bef-903c-1f617f23d474"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In practice, I found it hard to pinpoint the difference that NAR makes. With ANC, it’s easy to hear the low rumble of the road outside my apartment decrease in volume. It’s maybe not the most powerful ANC I have heard but it does the job. With NAR, whatever the ear equivalent of squinting is, proved to be a little more indeterminate. It does seem to slightly improve the listening experience in combination with ANC, but it’s also hard to tell how much of that was me willing it to do so. It’s an interesting concept though and one that I hope Grell can continue to improve over time.</p><p>Other small perks include a “mono” mode (listening with just one bud). This isn’t as common as it should be in my opinion and it adds more flexibility for those that want to maintain some spatial awareness without having to wear both buds. It’s also, obviously, how some people prefer to handle their calls, too (reliving the Bluetooth headset days).</p><p>Another small added bonus is wireless charging “compatibility.” It’s not something I was able to test, but the more things that support it the better? Or, at the very least, it’s a nice perk for those already invested in the wireless charging world.</p><p>All in, Grell has given price, features and sound quality enough consideration that the result is a promising first product from an emerging brand. The price point, in particular, strikes a good balance between signaling premium ambitions without putting it too far out of reach for mainstream casuals. I’d love to see some further advances on the NAR technology and the controls could still be more responsive, but if you’re looking for a fresh set of true wireless headphones that are customizable to your taste, these are a great place to start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/grell-audio-tws-1-earbuds-review-200056428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">632d7a0f-a5bc-47db-939f-09aeff37a650</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 20:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640634616</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T19:52:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b80507e0-671e-11ec-8d7a-08b472aa25ad" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Grell Audio TWS/1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best apps to download on your new smartphone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You just got your hands on a new phone. Naturally, your first inclination is to head to the App Store or the Google Play Store to download your favorite apps to your shiny new device. While the Engadget team tries to keep our phones relatively unencumbered, there are some apps we can&#39;t live without because they make our work and daily lives easier. Below you&#39;ll find a dozen of the best we think you should try.</p><h2>1Password</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/5e5eebb0-706c-11eb-b7ce-c09d93af4b80" alt="1Password for iOS" data-uuid="93d86017-9bd9-3f97-8663-cd290712c1c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>If you only take one piece of advice away from this article, it&#39;s that you should download a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html">password manager</a>. It doesn&#39;t have to be the one we recommend here. However, we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> for a handful of reasons. Not only will it let you generate strong passwords for all your online accounts, but it also has built-in support for two-factor authentication. That means you don&#39;t need to download a separate app like Authy to make your logins as secure as possible. If you have access to a Fastmail account, you can also use 1Password to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fastmail-1password-masked-email-110028257.html">generate random emails</a> for your logins, giving you another way to protect your privacy. It&#39;s also just a well-designed app that&#39;s a pleasure to use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>FireFox</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/70bf40d0-5e8b-11ec-b7f2-8f47f6b4d1e4" alt="Firefox" data-uuid="5c2b1559-f61c-387b-8fbc-b52f042c3201"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Firefox</div></figure><p>If it&#39;s been a few years since you last used Firefox, now is a great time to revisit it. Partway through last year, Mozilla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/firefox-for-android-update-080007893.html">overhauled the Android version</a> of its browser to bring over many of its best desktop features to mobile. That release saw Mozilla add more robust support for third-party add-ons. It also brought over its Enhanced Tracking Protection feature, which stops trackers from misusing your browsing data. Separately, with Apple allowing you to change your default browser since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-ios-14-130014162.html">release of iOS 14</a>, there&#39;s never been a better time for iPhone users to liberate themselves from Safari.</p><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8" alt="Headspace" data-uuid="b34162df-637f-305c-81d9-be2428168b1f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>I subscribed to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace" href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace</a> at the start of the pandemic. Since then, it&#39;s become one of the few apps I use every day. Yes, Headspace is a meditation and mindfulness app, but it&#39;s also so much more than that. You&#39;ll find it also has a mix of music designed to help you focus and workouts for unwinding at the end of a long day. Across the board, everything it offers is excellent, and you&#39;ll find yourself turning to it for more than just peace of mind.</p><h2>Hopper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf24f1d0-5e8a-11ec-bff3-a8bc5d7992ed" alt="Hopper app" data-uuid="18136120-77c6-3e17-bf7e-9f554a857897"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hopper</div></figure><p>If you plan to fly somewhere soon, install <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hopper" href="https://fave.co/31AdPP0">Hopper</a> on your phone. While it has grown over the years to include a variety of features, at its core, Hopper is one of the best ways to save money on plane tickets. Once you tell the app where and when you want to fly, it’ll tell you whether you should book your flight now or wait. In the latter case, it’ll notify you when it estimates you&#39;ll get the best deal. The beauty of Hopper is it will save you from constantly checking websites like Google Flights and Kayak.</p><h2>Libby</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c0443760-abf7-11eb-97bf-2c309f64c2f9" alt="Libby" data-uuid="d5e967d3-cd20-3160-b2da-4863a49a638d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Libby</div></figure><p>If you want to do more reading in 2022, forget about buying books through Amazon and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">download Libby</a> instead. If you&#39;re not familiar with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:app" href="https://fave.co/334ap89">app</a>, it allows you to borrow ebooks, digital magazines and graphic novels from your local library. All you need is a library card, which most systems across the US offer for free. Sometimes you have to wait to borrow the books you want to read most, but you&#39;ll find Libby will dramatically expand your reading list.</p><h2>Open Table</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/37db4870-5f46-11ec-b3f3-645f7ec545ea" alt="Open Table" data-uuid="f2a5d13e-97cc-3130-8c3a-92ec7b2487c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Open Table</div></figure><p>With restaurants reopening in cities throughout the US and the rest of the world, there&#39;s a good chance you plan to eat out sometime soon — and so does nearly everyone else. That means you&#39;ll likely need a reservation to dine at some of the most popular spots in your city. In North America, the closest you&#39;ll find to a single platform that nearly every restaurant uses is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Open Table" href="https://fave.co/3GfMIrK">Open Table</a>. For that reason alone, it&#39;s a must-download if you eat out a lot. It&#39;s also a handy tool for discovering new spots to visit since you can filter by cuisine and area.</p><h2>Transit</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cb70ae20-5e8a-11ec-9e7f-3374adcb4d05" alt="Transit app" data-uuid="e98950af-ce91-3899-922e-72fe03bd932f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Transit</div></figure><p>There&#39;s nothing worse than waiting for a bus on a cold winter’s day or watching three go by one after another. Avoid both situations with one of the best public transit planning apps on Android and iOS. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Transit" href="https://fave.co/3rUsNuH">Transit</a> excels where other apps in the category fail thanks to its clean, easy-to-use interface that highlights all the options near you. It also has one of the better algorithms for predicting departure times, so you&#39;ll know exactly when you need to run out of your house or apartment to catch the next bus, train or streetcar.</p><h2>Paprika</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7d220790-5e8b-11ec-9beb-3edf6f0f6641" alt="Paprika recipe app" data-uuid="fb9ca1ad-bb3b-3406-8b46-f525434aa278"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Paprika</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Paprika" href="https://fave.co/3Gk4j1A">Paprika</a> is the best $5 you can spend to make feeding yourself even easier. At its core, it allows you to download recipes from your favorite websites and make them accessible on all your devices. You can also use it to scale the size of the meal you&#39;re about to cook and convert between metric and imperial measurements. Add to that a meal planner, shopping lists and a tool for tracking the ingredients in your pantry, and you have an indispensable app for home cooks.</p><h2>Pocket Casts</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d991c6b0-5e8a-11ec-b69f-401c90e23326" alt="Pocket Casts app" data-uuid="d95444c2-35ed-393c-a323-38452f607168"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket Casts</div></figure><p>With podcasts becoming ever more popular with each passing year, there&#39;s a good chance you already have a handful of favorite shows you listen to every week. As much as Spotify would like to convince you it has the best podcast app, that distinction goes to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket Casts" href="https://fave.co/3lDMbrK">Pocket Casts</a>. We like it because it offers a consistently great experience across every system it supports. And if you use a mix of platforms from Apple, Google and Microsoft, you don&#39;t have to worry about syncing, either. It’s also nice to use software that doesn’t feel caught between two worlds in the way that Spotify does. Pocket Casts isn’t trying to be anything more than an app for listening to podcasts. That’s not something you can say of Spotify, and it’s often a source of frustration for those who turn to it for music.</p><h2>Pocket</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e72ebb20-5e8a-11ec-bbbd-79f45195740b" alt="Pocket app" data-uuid="6d6e1281-8451-31ed-9b77-8e3da3515923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pocket</div></figure><p>Another way to read more in 2022 is to download <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pocket" href="https://fave.co/3pv4alp">Pocket</a>. It&#39;s among the most popular read-it-later apps out there, allowing you to save articles you find online. Much like Pocket Casts, what makes this app compelling is that it offers a consistently excellent device-agnostic experience, making it a great option for those who haven&#39;t gone all-in on one ecosystem. Whether you use Chrome, Safari or Edge, you can install a browser extension to save articles you stumble upon. You can then read them later without distractions on your phone or tablet. Just don&#39;t forget to make a dent in your Pocket reading list occasionally.</p><h2>Telegram / Signal</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8c925c70-5e8b-11ec-bd73-3cebb4a8cffb" alt="Telegram app" data-uuid="cc4e6000-c3ef-39d7-b65e-0333105a8e20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Telegram</div></figure><p>We understand, asking your friends and family to install another messaging app on their phone can sometimes feel like a Sisyphean task, but the effort has also never been more worth it. In <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Telegram" href="https://fave.co/3Ew10nt">Telegram</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Signal" href="https://fave.co/3rJxOWD">Signal</a>, you&#39;ll find two of the most secure chat apps on the market. We especially like Telegram here at Engadget because of how complete it feels from a feature standpoint. For example, it includes an edit feature that comes in handy when you make a typo, and a Secret Chat tool for when you want messages to disappear. If you do make the switch to Telegram or Signal, you&#39;ll also free yourself of the Meta ecosystem. That might not seem like much, but when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-outage-explainer-193155776.html">went down earlier this year</a>, it left many people without a way to communicate with their friends and loved ones.</p><h2>Tunnelbear</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/fbcd8330-c5df-11ea-9f7b-2d20663edfe1" alt="Tunnelbear for Android" data-uuid="ab882100-ea83-4399-b432-8032f85e94e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tunnelbear</div></figure><p>After a Password manager, one of the best tools you can use to safeguard your online privacy is a VPN. Again, there are many options out there, but we like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:TunnelBear" href="https://fave.co/3FTjEHk">TunnelBear</a> for its simplicity and whimsical ursine theme. A VPN isn&#39;t as essential as a password manager, but you&#39;ll want to get one if you frequently find yourself traveling or using the public WiFi at places like cafes and libraries. Using a VPN in those contexts will ensure your connection is protected with encryption so that any information you send over remains safe and private.</p><h2>Snapseed</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/465381b0-5f46-11ec-b3ff-47f3a4374f8c" alt="Snapseed" data-uuid="5426a1fc-104d-37c1-9e2a-3044105fb545"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snapseed</div></figure><p>Most recent phones come with great cameras. Still, even with the latest iPhone, Samsung Galaxy or Google Pixel, almost every photo can benefit from an edit before you share it. The options you have for photo editing apps are nearly endless, but if you want something that works well, look no further than <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Snapseed" href="https://fave.co/3oo9yHv">Snapseed</a>. It&#39;s an old favorite that offers a comprehensive suite of editing options but never gets bogged down in too many sliders and dials. Best of all, it makes it easy to save edits to your camera roll and upload them to apps like Instagram.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-apps-to-download-on-your-new-smartphone-ios-android-180049321.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e99bfad-2528-4914-92ca-34ae96e3f702</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 18:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639763702</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T17:55:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9583aea0-5f45-11ec-979f-99b7961e00e6" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elisaveta Ivanova via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young woman using smart phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s ‘New World’ is among the year’s biggest money makers on Steam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has once again given some insight into the highest-earning games of the year on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam/">Steam</a>.

While device bans require more effort to circumvent, particularly on mobile, it&#39;s not impossible.

racing game fan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m not much of a car guy, but I do enjoy a good drive on an open road and have at least a passing appreciation for a fine automobile. Of course, my beyond-humble Toyota Prius only offers so much in the way of driving thrills. A realistic racing game always sounded like a great way to scratch that driving itch, but they’re almost always just too involved and difficult for me.</p><p>But my colleague Jess Conditt described the Forza Horizon series as “the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles” in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html">her glowing preview of the game</a>. I was sold, and so far <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> has entirely lived up to the hype and praise it has received.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A big part of the reason why is that it’s the most approachable driving game I’ve ever tried. Take the ingenious “rewind button.” At first, I would push the accelerator to the floor and rarely let up, which made actually taking a turn without wiping out damn near impossible. But the rewind button let me try these difficult turns again without completely blowing the race I’m in or having to start the entire thing over again. I think that it helped me get better at the game significantly faster than I would have if I had to re-do a course every time I blew a turn. Without it, I’m pretty sure I would have given up on <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> pretty quickly.</p><div id="0cfc6c1c2b044436822a7e2dafb6befb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>What I wanted out of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> was the ability to drive vintage and modern cars I’d never get a chance to own around a beautifully-rendered Mexican countryside, and the auto car-tuning feature was another thing that made this dream easy to achieve. For people who really want to dive into it, the game’s cars are extremely customizable — but I couldn’t be bothered to figure out exactly what anti-roll bars, tires, suspension systems and so on I needed to buy so my 2003 Volkswagen GTI R32 would keep up with the competition. (Note to Jess: GTI. Every. Time.)</p><p>Fortunately, there’s an auto-upgrade feature that can level up your car to the top of various tiers (C isn’t as great as A, which isn’t as great as S1, for example). Of course, you’ll need to pay for the parts, but it’s worth the cost to max out your vehicles of choice without spending all day figuring out exactly what parts to buy.</p><section data-eng-breakout="74cfc697af8f44648b03d669f13bc777" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bfbd20-6727-11ec-bdb9-363ef8275d64" alt="Forza Horizon 5"></section><p>In the frankly shocking amount of time I’ve poured into <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> already, I’ve been delighted to find a game with the perfect blend of serious driving challenge and realism coupled with tools and design that make it extremely appealing to someone like me, who doesn’t have the time or desire to endlessly tweak their car for every race. It’s a lot more realistic than most arcade-style racers, but it’s definitely not so unforgiving as to be inaccessible to people who aren’t racing nerds.</p><p>Whether you’re a novice like me or someone more experienced with racing games, you’ll find a ton to keep you busy. Ultimately, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> isn’t wildly different from open-world adventure games — there’s a “story” you can follow and unlock different chapters as you go, and there’s also a huge variety of different challenges spread all over the map. I gravitated towards road racing events, but there’s a huge variety of different courses. Others might prefer going off-road, trying drag racing or competing in events to rack up trick points.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7c73730-6727-11ec-affe-aef384e1a4ff" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="cbc95916-9508-3b3e-8d26-749b53d18879"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games/Microsoft</div></figure><p>Regardless of how you like to play, it’s also a beautiful game; I was stunned by the variety of scenery across this little corner of Mexico I got to explore. Coupling that with events taking place at all different types of day and in different weather conditions and there’s always something new to see. I’ve only played it on the Xbox Series S on a 1080p TV — I’m hoping I can give it a go on a Series X or well-tuned gaming PC soon and see just how good it can look with the right hardware. But even on my more modest setup, I’m enjoying this game in a way I never expected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-gaming-irl-racing-154527277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2194bbf-2c5b-45e1-a59f-7a6cdd3c344d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 15:45:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640618802</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T15:26:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c7bcd6f0-6727-11ec-af9b-ff300c1335dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Playground Games/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best accessories for your new Nintendo Switch OLED edition]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED" href="https://amzn.to/3oyDiBw">Switch OLED</a> is out, and it’s a real beaut. It has a larger 7-inch screen, longer battery life and a few other welcome design improvements to its handheld gaming mode. I was impressed when I reviewed it back in October, and it’s been flying off store shelves since its release. It’s so hard to get one right now, in fact, that you may have to go to eBay to snag one before the holidays. But if you do have one — congrats! Now you probably want to make the most of your new system, and there are a few accessories that will go a long way toward making the Switch OLED a truly stellar console.</p><h2>SanDisk microSD card</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/feb6f7e0-584e-11ec-afdf-4512fd2e4daf" alt="SanDisk Nintendo Switch microSD card" data-uuid="25bafb89-6544-3e30-a6af-c36b302bdc51"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SanDisk</div></figure><p>With only 64GB of on-board storage, you’re going to want to get a microSD for your Switch OLED to store downloaded games, save files and screenshots. And with the redesigned slot it’s easier than ever to put it in or take it out of the system, too. You can use pretty much any microSD card with your Nintendo Switch, but the Nintendo-branded ones from SanDisk are solid, and you can get a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB model" href="https://amzn.to/31oG4QC">256GB model</a> at a pretty affordable rate right now.

One <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html">recent one</a> speculated that the headset might depend on another device like an iPhone or a Mac computer.

They’re the sisters at the heart of Riot Games’ hit Netflix series, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html"><em>Arcane</em></a>, and they were picked for the spotlight out of a lineup of more than 150 <em>League of Legends </em>champions.</p><p>For <em>Arcane </em>creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee, the stars really couldn’t have been anyone else from <em>League of Legends</em> lore. Especially not Teemo. Linke and Yee have been preparing Jinx and Vi for their leading roles in a mature, mainstream, animated TV series for the past nine years, even if they didn’t know it the entire time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fad7f184b1fb41d4976f57dc602b07d4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Back in December 2012, Vi debuted and became the first <em>League of Legends</em> champion to receive a login screen complete with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEXoT9RMZ2E">original, lyrical song</a>. A year later, Jinx joined the game’s ranks and starred in its first character-driven cinematic, a high-energy music video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs"><em>Get Jinxed</em></a>. Linke and Yee worked on both of these releases, flexing their creative muscles in music and narrative storyboarding, two aspects that didn’t get much attention in the core game-development process.</p><p>The Jinx cinematic was also the first time Riot partnered with Fortiche Production, the studio behind <em>Arcane</em>’s otherworldly animation style.</p><p>“They kind of got our special treatment already because we just really liked them,” Linke told Engadget. “And so, when we had to think about like, which characters do we want to stick with for many years to come? I think it was pretty obvious.”</p><p>Yee agreed and added, “Both of them were a bit of a milestone, I think, for our time at Riot.”</p><div id="6e469dce6ea042968b9f787b060f79b5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nlJuwO0GDs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In-game, Jinx and Vi are sisters and bitter enemies, though this story fades into the background of the action, appearing only in small voice lines and character descriptions. As an online MOBA, narrative isn’t critical to the way <em>League of Legends</em> plays, but Riot has infused its champions with more lore over the years, focusing on expanding their universe beyond the game launcher.</p><p>Nowadays, Riot is a hub of creative development across multiple mediums, including short stories, graphic novels, cinematics, music videos and one truly fantastic K-pop group. <em>Arcane </em>is the studio’s biggest push onto a mainstream service, and Jinx and Vi carry the story, surrounded by a handful of other champions, including Caitlyn, Jayce and Viktor, and other original characters.</p><p>Jinx and Vi were always intriguing to Linke and Yee. They were grounded in a way that the game’s more fantastical champions weren’t, with distinct, opposing personalities and an unexplained rivalry that clearly cut both sisters to the core. Vi was a powerful, rigid Enforcer working for the prosperous city of Piltover, while Jinx was an anarchist with a belt full of bombs and no filter. Vi’s hair is short and pink, while Jinx’s is long and bright blue.</p><p>“If you just imagine those two characters together in a scene, whatever location, whatever they would be debating – you know, what kind of food they&#39;re going to get in the evening, or what kind of movie they&#39;re going to watch,” Linke said. “It&#39;s just always going to be fun, because they&#39;re always going to have these very different perspectives.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="b7780f86486844919a8bd7589f19b954" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" alt="Arcane"></section><p>There’s an inherent question in Jinx and Vi’s shared backstory, Yee said, and it’s a mystery that fans of the game and newcomers to the show would be able to grasp quickly: If they’re sisters, why do they hate each other so much? <em>Arcane </em>asks that question and slowly answers it, providing a rich, emotionally charged origin story for Jinx, Vi and their surrounding champions along the way.</p><p>“The fact that Jinx and Vi’s relationship is a bit of a mystery from the outset allows us to sort of satisfy both audiences,” Yee said.</p><p>In <em>Arcane</em>, Linke and Yee were able to zoom in and focus on the small details that bring their characters to life, showing micro-expressions and all-consuming rage on Jinx’s face, or giving Vi a nuanced nervous tick, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html">bouncing her leg</a>. Fortiche Production, the studio that handles animation duties for <em>Arcane </em>and other Riot projects, was a pivotal part of this development process. Animators there were given leeway to express themselves in the characters, Linke said, and this resulted in a unique visual style that flowed like motion-capture, even though it was completely hand-drawn.</p><p>“We also tried to really treat the animators like actors who can find their ways of expressing things, rather than just kind of saying, make Jinx or Vi do this,” Linke said. “But instead, just being like, here&#39;s what&#39;s going on in their head, how can we really make that feel real?”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec27fe0-642a-11ec-be3e-505c52e2c32b" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="a9d0d2a4-0021-3cef-8964-5c77e5772858"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p>After nearly 10 years of in-game development and cross-media projects, Jinx and Vi are still able to surprise Linke and Yee. Developing <em>Arcane</em>, for instance, marked the first time they’d seen any <em>League of Legends</em> champion actually speaking, mouth movements and all.</p><p>“When we did our first trial, or our first test animatic for the show, it was the first time we&#39;d ever seen any of our champions talk,” Yee said. “We&#39;d never – their mouths don&#39;t move in game, you know. So it was a very funny milestone to cross at that point.”</p><p>Given how well <em>Arcane </em>has been received by <em>League of Legends</em> fans and newcomers alike, there are plenty more creative milestones to come as Riot continues its ride into mainstream entertainment. Season two of <em>Arcane</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu9HTOIUxLk">is in production</a> as we — and Jinx and Vi — speak.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcane-jinx-vi-interview-league-legends-riot-netflix-170027289.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fb77e7d-90b2-46b5-9ce7-6cc289d6150d</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640290728</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T20:19:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec20ab0-642a-11ec-adbf-d93b80b37014" width="1370" height="771" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec20ab0-642a-11ec-adbf-d93b80b37014" width="1370" height="771" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to set up your new Apple Watch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many Apple products, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch" href="https://amzn.to/3saa3Ht">Apple Watch</a> can be extremely simple to start using — but that simplicity hides a surprising level of depth and customization. If you just received an Apple Watch, there’s a lot to do to make sure you’re getting the most out of your new wearable. Let us guide you through that process, from initial setup to optimizing everything it can do.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>Of course, the first thing you’ll want to do is pair your Apple Watch with your iPhone. Even if you have a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:cellular-capable Apple Watch" href="https://amzn.to/3J16Y2H">cellular-capable Apple Watch</a>, an iPhone is required for setting up and managing the device. Fortunately, this process is extremely straightforward — after powering on the Apple Watch, just place it near an unlocked iPhone and you’ll get a prompt to set the device up. During this process, your iPhone will walk you through the initial pairing as well as signing in with your Apple ID, assigning a passcode to your Watch, setting up things like Siri and Apple Pay, and deciding if you want to transfer your compatible apps to the Watch. I recommend against transferring all your apps automatically this first time, as the Watch is a lot more useful when you curate it with only what you <em>need</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/65a446d0-5f50-11ec-93df-91c4c5e63f67" alt="Apple Watch notifications" data-uuid="1ff7f25c-0927-3fd1-a90d-cb1c987441d8"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A few features you definitely should set up are fall detection and emergency SOS. The latter lets you quickly place a call to local emergency services by pressing and holding the side button, while fall detection uses the Watch’s accelerometers and other sensors to, well, detect if you’ve taken a bad spill. It’ll initiate an emergency SOS call automatically if it detects a fall and doesn’t detect you moving. Before making that call, the Watch will try its best to get your attention via a notification, a vibration and an audible alarm.</p><h2>The fun part: tweaking apps and notifications</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="3230d43e-c6c7-3d6c-a561-ba7d52b65502"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to make the Apple Watch your own. By default, the Apple Watch mirrors all notifications that go to your phone. But I’ve found the Watch to be much more useful with a bit of curation. In the iPhone Watch app, you can customize notifications for all of Apple’s first-party apps, or turn them off entirely. For example, the Activity app notifications panel lets you choose whether or not you want reminders to stand every hour, or notifications when your friends share activity milestones with you and so forth.</p><p>Third-party apps don’t have the same granularity, but you can turn them off so they won’t ping your Watch. For things that aren’t particularly time-sensitive (say, updates from Google Photos, or if you don’t want the Apple News app overloading your wrist), feel free to turn them off. They’ll still hit your iPhone, and you can always enable them again later.</p><p>The iPhone Watch app also lets you pick which specific apps from your iPhone will be installed on the Apple Watch. I think this is more useful than just letting the Watch install every single compatible app, because that might mean you have a few dozen apps to sift through on your Watch to see if they’re useful or not. Instead, I prefer going through the list and deciding if there’s a benefit to having these apps on my wrist. In the case of apps like Google Maps or Ecobee for controlling my thermostat, it’s a definite yes. But things like Etsy or Bank of America don’t exactly make a ton of sense on a Watch. And if you ever change your mind, you can remove an app from the Watch app or by long-pressing it in grid view and deleting it – just keep in mind that this will remove the app from your Watch but not from your iPhone.</p><p>That said, I have been surprised at what some developers have envisioned for the Apple Watch. Take the notes app Bear, for example. I often use it to make grocery lists, and checklists show up great on the Apple Watch. So if there’s an app on your phone that you consider essential, give it a shot on the Watch.</p><h2>Watch faces</h2><p>Another occasionally-overlooked part of the Apple Watch experience are watch faces. Since this is literally what you’ll see every time you raise your wrist, I think it’s worth finding ones that fit your personal style. While there are no third-party faces, the Apple Watch has more than 30 built-in options that are endlessly customizable. We’re talking about a huge variety of colors, different typefaces and watch face styles, complications (small slices of info like weather, date, or music controls) and much more. You can have a simple digital time display with nothing else, or an info-dense face with eight different complications or anything in between.</p><p>You can set up new faces on the Watch directly — but as with most in-depth features, it’s easier to do this on the iPhone. The Face Gallery shows every available face, along with multiple examples of how they can be customized. You can use those as a jumping off point to make your own creations. Once you’ve curated your favorites, you can simply swipe through them on the Watch itself when you want to mix things up. If you long press on a face, you can edit it directly on your Watch too, which is handy when you want to just change the color quickly to better match your outfit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/120c76d0-5f4d-11ec-ab3e-59df7abc5955" alt="Apple Watch faces" data-uuid="47e7f3a8-8998-3594-bd04-3f98828397d9"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re using an Apple Watch Series 5, 6 or 7, you can also decide whether you want to activate the always-on display. You can find this option in the settings app, under “Display &amp; Brightness.” If you’re after maximum battery life, turn this off, but most people will probably prefer it on. New watches can still get a full day of use while using the always-on feature, but once your watch ages a bit and battery performance degrades, you might want to learn to live without it.</p><h2>Fitness tracking</h2><p>One of the biggest Apple Watch selling points is its fitness-tracking features. Whether or not you actively exercise on a regular basis, the Watch will track your steps and activity level, and use that data to track your daily movement via three rings that you’re encouraged to close. The “move” ring is how many active calories you burn in a day, the “exercise” ring tracks activity at or above a brisk walk, and the “stand” ring tracks whether or not you get up and move for a minute or two each hour of the day.</p><p>When you set up your Apple Watch, it’ll suggest daily goals for each of these, and the Activity app (or the Fitness app on your iPhone) will show how close you are to hitting them. If you’ve never used an Apple Watch before, it’s fine to just go with the defaults — every week, you’ll get a recap of how you did and it’ll even suggest bumping up your Move number if you’re easily surpassing it. The exercise and stand options default to 30 minutes per day and 12 hours per day, but those too can be adjusted.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68b1b540-5f4d-11ec-a59a-4faf9cf1e6c3" alt="Apple Watch fitness" data-uuid="528d4bb8-2e73-33fd-aea3-11545b06cefc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For extra motivation, the Fitness app lets you connect with other friends who use an Apple Watch and see how much progress they’re making against their three rings. Naturally, you can use this information to taunt them about their couch-potato habits, but you can also challenge them to informal competitions. You earn points based on the percentage you close each of your rings every day, and the person with the most points after a week wins. It’s pretty casual, but it’s also a fun way to stay motivated.</p><p>If you want to track a specific workout, like a run, walk, or weight-training session you do that in the “workout” app. There, you’ll find the many different types of workouts that the Watch can track. If you already have a favorite way to track exercise on your phone, though, chances are you can find it for the Apple Watch too. Nike Run Club, MapMyRun, Peloton and others all have Watch apps that let you track workouts using the wearable’s sensors. Also, a lot of apps can now connect with the Health app on your iPhone. It’s a database of all your activity and workout data from your Watch, so you might be able to easily sync workout data from there into your service of choice. As with most things Apple Watch, it’ll just take a bit of playing around to see what works best for you.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>One of my favorite things about the Apple Watch is that it can stream music and podcasts – not just from Apple’s services but others like Spotify and Pandora as well. You’ll need a cellular-capable Watch to stream music without your phone, but the good news is that Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora all allow you to save music directly on the Watch as well. Regardless of whether you spring for the cellular model or not, there’s a way to listen to tunes and leave your phone behind.</p><p>If you’re an Apple Music user, you’ll manage downloaded music through the Watch app on your iPhone. Pop that open and go to the “Music” section and you’ll see a big button to add songs to your watch. There’s also a setting that’ll automatically download albums and playlists you’ve listened to recently – turn that on and you’ll always have some music on your wrist.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/14dc89f0-5f51-11ec-beff-76085033b240" alt="Apple Watch music" data-uuid="87e8579d-9aa3-3ac5-9b8a-6a88a485c81a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s easy to choose specific albums or playlists you want saved, too. Just hit the big plus button and you’ll see your Apple Music library. From there, just navigate to what you want, hit another plus button and it’ll be downloaded to your Watch. Note that music only transfers when your Watch is charging, so you’ll need to take it off your wrist to sync.</p><p>If you’re using Spotify, just navigate to an album, playlist or podcast on your phone and tap the three dots icon – you’ll see an option to “download to Apple Watch” there. Then, on your watch, there’s a clearly-marked “downloads” section where you can play content without a connection.</p><h2>Experiment, experiment, experiment!</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4" alt="The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="8da67b38-07aa-3973-a561-f883c426c7b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like many Apple products, the Apple Watch has a lot of functionality and hidden complexity beneath its user-friendly surface. But I’ve found that the Watch hides a lot of features, so it’s worth checking out the built-in Tips app for suggestions on what you can do. Without a guide like that, you’ll probably never realize that clicking the side button twice summons Apple Pay, or that you can display the grid of icons in a list if you prefer. Chances are good you’re not going to irrevocably mess something up, so tap and swipe and scroll and dig into the settings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-set-up-your-new-apple-watch-150031548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c12825f-1c7c-42a2-af55-02ab1d02351b</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 15:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640623211</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T16:41:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person's wrist, showing the screen's refracted edge and the watch's dial and button.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Amiga and the birth of 256-color gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With modern consoles offering gamers graphics so photorealistic that they blur the line between CGI and reality, it&#39;s easy forget just how cartoonishly blocky they were in the 8-bit era.

In the excerpt below, Davis explains how the industry made its technological leap from 8- to 12-bit graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52bfe620-3dac-11ec-bb7f-2ca9252fc43d" alt="qbert" data-uuid="6878a9f0-0a21-345e-af42-28e8f8b7151f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Santa Monica Press</div></figure><p>©2021 Santa Monica Press</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Back at my regular day job, I became particularly fascinated with a new product that came out for the Amiga computer: a video digitizer made by a company called A-Squared. Let’s unpack all that slowly.</p><p>The Amiga was a recently released home computer capable of unprecedented graphics and sound: 4,096 colors! Eight-bit stereo sound! There were image manipulation programs for it that could do things no other computer, including the IBM PC, could do. We had one at Williams not only because of its capabilities, but also because our own Jack Haeger, an immensely talented artist who’d worked on Sinistar at Williams a few years earlier, was also the art director for the Amiga design team.</p><p>Video digitization is the process of grabbing a video image from some video source, like a camera or a videotape, and converting it into pixel data that a computer system (or video game) could use. A full-color photograph might contain millions of colors, many just subtly different from one another. Even though the Amiga could only display 4,096 colors, that was enough to see an image on its monitor that looked almost perfectly photographic.</p><p>Our video game system still could only display 16 colors total. At that level, photographic images were just not possible. But we (and by that I mean everyone working in the video game industry) knew that would change. As memory became cheaper and processors faster, we knew that 256-color systems would soon be possible. In fact, when I started looking into digitized video, our hardware designer, Mark Loffredo, was already playing around with ideas for a new 256-color hardware system.</p><p>Let’s talk about color resolution for a second. Come on, you know you want to. No worries if you don’t, though, you can skip these next few paragraphs if you like. Color resolution is the number of colors a computer system is capable of displaying. And it’s all tied in to memory. For example, our video game system could display 16 colors. But artists weren’t locked into 16 specific colors. The hardware used a “palette.” Artists could choose from a fairly wide range of colors, but only 16 of them could be saved in the palette at any given time. Those colors could be programmed to change while a game was running. In fact, changing colors in a palette dynamically allowed for a common technique used in old video games called “color cycling.”</p><p>For the hardware to know what color to display at each pixel location, each pixel on the screen had to be identified as one of those 16 colors in the palette. The collection of memory that contained the color values for every pixel on the screen was called “screen memory.” Numerically, it takes 4 bits (half a byte) to represent 16 numbers (trust me on the math here), so if 4 bits = 1 pixel, then 1 byte of memory could hold 2 pixels. By contrast, if you wanted to be able to display 256 colors, it would take 8 bits to represent 256 numbers. That’s 1 byte (or 8 bits) per pixel.</p><p>So you’d need twice as much screen memory to display 256 colors as you would to display 16. Memory wasn’t cheap, though, and game manufacturers wanted to keep costs down as much as possible. So memory prices had to drop before management approved doubling the screen memory.</p><p>Today we take for granted color resolutions of 24 bits per pixel (which potentially allows up to 16,777,216 colors and true photographic quality). But back then, 256 colors seemed like such a luxury. Even though it didn’t approach the 4,096 colors of the Amiga, I was convinced that such a system could result in close to photo-realistic images. And the idea of having movie-quality images in a video game was very exciting to me, so I pitched to management the advantages of getting a head start on this technology. They agreed and bought the digitizer for me to play around with.</p><p>The Amiga’s digitizer was crude. Very crude. It came with a piece of hardware that plugged into the Amiga on one end, and to the video output of a black-and-white surveillance camera (sold separately) on the other. The camera needed to be mounted on a tripod so it didn’t move. You pointed it at something (that also couldn’t move), and put a color wheel between the camera and the subject. The color wheel was a circular piece of plastic divided into quarters with different tints: red, green, blue, and clear.</p><p>When you started the digitizing process, a motor turned the color wheel very slowly, and in about thirty to forty seconds you had a full-color digitized image of your subject. “Full-color” on the Amiga meant 4 bits of red, green, and blue—or 12-bit color, resulting in a total of 4,096 colors possible.</p><p>It’s hard to believe just how exciting this was! At that time, it was like something from science fiction. And the coolness of it wasn’t so much how it worked (because it was pretty damn clunky) but the potential that was there. The Amiga digitizer wasn’t practical—the camera and subject needed to be still for so long, and the time it took to grab each image made the process mind-numbingly slow—but just having the ability to produce 12-bit images at all enabled me to start exploring algorithms for color reduction.</p><p>Color reduction is the process of taking an image with a lot of colors (say, up to the 16,777,216 possible colors in a 24-bit image) and finding a smaller number of colors (say, 256) to best represent that image. If you could do that, then those 256 colors would form a palette, and every pixel in the image would be represented by a number—an “index” that pointed to one of the colors in that palette. As I mentioned earlier, with a palette of 256 colors, each index could fit into a single byte.</p><p>But I needed an algorithm to figure out how to pick the best 256 colors out of the thousands that might be present in a digitized image. Since there was no internet back then, I went to libraries and began combing through academic journals and technical magazines, searching for research done in this area. Eventually, I found some! There were numerous papers written on the subject, each outlining a different approach, some easier to understand than others. Over the next few weeks, I implemented a few of these algorithms for generating 256 color palettes using test images from the Amiga digitizer. Some gave better results than others. Images that were inherently monochromatic looked the best, since many of the 256 colors could be allotted to different shades of a single color.</p><p>During this time, Loffredo was busy developing his 256-color hardware. His plan was to support multiple circuit boards, which could be inserted into slots as needed, much like a PC. A single board would give you one surface plane to draw on. A second board gave you two planes, foreground and background, and so on. With enough planes, and by having each plane scroll horizontally at a slightly different rate, you could give the illusion of depth in a side-scrolling game.</p><p>All was moving along smoothly until the day word came down that Eugene Jarvis had completed his MBA and was returning to Williams to head up the video department. This was big news! I think most people were pretty excited about this. I know I was, because despite our movement toward 256-color hardware, the video department was still without a strong leader at the helm. Eugene, given his already legendary status at Williams, was the perfect person to take the lead, partly because he had some strong ideas of where to take the department, and also due to management’s faith in him. Whereas anybody else would have to convince management to go along with an idea, Eugene pretty much had carte blanche in their eyes. Once he was back, he told management what we needed to do and they made sure he, and we, had the resources to do it.</p><p>This meant, however, that Loffredo’s planar hardware system was toast. Eugene had his own ideas, and everyone quickly jumped on board. He wanted to create a 256-color system based on a new CPU chip from Texas Instruments, the 34010 GSP (Graphics System Processor). The 34010 was revolutionary in that it included graphics-related features within its core. Normally, CPUs would have no direct connection to the graphics portion of the hardware, though there might be some co-processor to handle graphics chores (such as Williams’ proprietary VLSI blitter). But the 34010 had that capability on board, obviating the need for a graphics co-processor.</p><p>Looking at the 34010’s specs, however, revealed that the speed of its graphics functions, while well-suited for light graphics work such as spreadsheets and word processors, was certainly not fast enough for pushing pixels the way we needed. So Mark Loffredo went back to the drawing board to design a VLSI blitter chip for the new system.</p><p>Around this time, a new piece of hardware arrived in the marketplace that signaled the next generation of video digitizing. It was called the Image Capture Board (ICB), and it was developed by a group within AT&amp;T called the EPICenter (which eventually split from AT&amp;T and became Truevision). The ICB was one of three boards offered, the others being the VDA (Video Display Adapter, with no digitizing capability) and the Targa (which came in three different configurations: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 24-bit). The ICB came with a piece of software called TIPS that allowed you to digitize images and do some minor editing on them. All of these boards were designed to plug in to an internal slot on a PC running MS-DOS, the original text-based operating system for the IBM PC. (You may be wondering . . . where was Windows? Windows 1.0 was introduced in 1985, but it was terribly clunky and not widely used or accepted. Windows really didn’t achieve any kind of popularity until version 3.0, which arrived in 1990, a few years after the release of Truvision’s boards.)</p><p>A little bit of trivia: the TGA file format that’s still around today (though not as popular as it once was) was created by Truevision for the TARGA series of boards. The ICB was a huge leap forward from the Amiga digitizer in that you could use a color video camera (no more black-and-white camera or color wheel), and the time to grab a frame was drastically reduced—not quite instantaneous, as I recall, but only a second or two, rather than thirty or forty seconds. And it internally stored colors as 16-bits, rather than 12 like the Amiga. This meant 5 bits each of red, green, and blue—the same that our game hardware used—resulting in a true-color image of up to 32,768 colors, rather than 4,096. Palette reduction would still be a crucial step in the process. The greatest thing about the Truevision boards was they came with a Software Development Kit (SDK), which meant I could write my own software to control the board, tailoring it to my specific needs. This was truly amazing! Once again, I was so excited about the possibilities that my head was spinning.</p><p>I think it’s safe to say that most people making video games in those days thought about the future. We realized that the speed and memory limitations we were forced to work under were a temporary constraint. We realized that whether the video game industry was a fad or not, we were at the forefront of a new form of storytelling. Maybe this was a little more true for me because of my interest in filmmaking, or maybe not. But my experiences so far in the game industry fueled my imagination about what might come. And for me, the holy grail was interactive movies. The notion of telling a story in which the player was not a passive viewer but an active participant was extremely compelling. People were already experimenting with it under the constraints of current technology. Zork and the rest of Infocom’s text adventure games were probably the earliest examples, and more would follow with every improvement in technology. But what I didn’t know was if the technology needed to achieve my end goal—fully interactive movies with film-quality graphics—would ever be possible in my lifetime. I didn’t dwell on these visions of the future. They were just thoughts in my head. Yet, while it’s nice to dream, at some point you’ve got to come back down to earth. If you don’t take the one step in front of you, you can be sure you’ll never reach your ultimate destination, wherever that may be.</p><p>I dove into the task and began learning the specific capabilities of the board, as well as its limitations. With the first iteration of my software, which I dubbed WTARG (“W” for Williams, “TARG” for TARGA), you could grab a single image from either a live camera or a videotape. I added a few different palette reduction algorithms so you could try each and find the best palette for that image. More importantly, I added the ability to find the best palette for a group of images, since all the images of an animation needed to have a consistent look. There was no chroma key functionality in those early boards, so artists would have to erase the background manually. I added some tools to help them do that.</p><p>This was a far cry from what I ultimately hoped for, which was a system where we could point a camera at live actors and instantly have an animation of their action running on our game hardware. But it was a start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-creating-qbert-and-other-classic-video-arcade-games-warren-davis-santa-monica-press-163011566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42f3d1c1-fecb-4ad5-acbb-85a35670f6dd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638995207</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T20:27:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Detail of the logo on a vintage 1980's Commodore Amiga 500 personal computer and games console, taken on September 14, 2016.

Deliveries for the Hummer EV pickup are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-deliveries-december-101042969.html">slated to begin this month</a>. There have even been rumblings about adapting the Hummer EV frame and power system <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-hummer-ev-military-vehicle-elrv-181909646.html">to military applications</a>, though no firm decisions on that proposal have yet been made.</p><p>Hummers are only the start. In April, GM confirmed that its second EV model will be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-electric-silverado-043134066.html">an electrified Silverado</a>. We still don’t know a whole lot about the Silverado beyond that it will leverage GM’s Ultium battery tech, that the company is aiming for a 400-plus mile range, and that the EV pickup will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-shows-off-four-wheel-steering-on-the-upcoming-silverado-ev-190022577.html">offer four-wheel steering</a>, which shortens turn radius’ at low speeds and increases cornering stability at high speeds — especially when towing loads.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ll have a full accounting of the Silverado’s capabilities once it makes its official debut during <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-electric-silverado-debut-ces-2022-045915793.html">GM’s CES 2022 keynote address</a>. What’s more, GM teased its third upcoming EV in July — a full-size GMC pickup, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/19/gm-confirms-third-electric-pickup-truck-ahead-of-hummer-ev-production.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. Virtually nothing else is known about it at this time, not even if it will use the existing GMC Sierra branding. Hopefully, we’ll get some more hints in the new year.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the Stellantis Group (formerly FCA and umbrella company to Chrysler, Jeep Dodge, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and a host of others) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/stellantis-to-invest-35point5-billion-in-evs-and-new-technologies-by-2025.html">announced in July</a> that it, too, will be investing $35 billion towards its electrification efforts through 2025 and will have 55 electrified vehicles (40 BEVs, 15 PHEVs) available in the US and European markets by the end of that year. What’s more, Stellantis is working on an all-electric Ram EV to compete with the Silverado and Ford F-150 Lightning, though the Ram isn’t expected to be released until 2024. For its part in 2021, Jeep showed off a slick-looking <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeeps-all-electric-wrangler-concept-has-a-six-speed-manual-transmission-122031458.html">Wrangler BEV concept in March</a>, released its “light hybrid” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-sahara-4-xe-phev-first-drive-174554804.html">Wrangler Sahara 4XE in May</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-2022-grand-cherokee-4xe-debut-september-29-173239673.html">debuted its PHEV Cherokee 4XE</a> in September ahead of the vehicle’s 2022 release.</p><p>Ford also had a year worthy of honking its own horn about, starting with the February release of the Mustang Mach-E. The EV was met with <a href="http://v/">a bit of trepidation to start</a> but cemented its position with the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html">performance-focused GT edition</a>. In all, Ford had sold more 21,000 Mach-E units through this past October, despite a handful of recalls for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mustang-mach-e-recall-222632366.html">loose bolts</a> and “deep sleeping” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-battery-issue-212744852.html">software bugs</a>. That’s not bad for a first-year crossover SUV working to get past deeply ingrained customer nostalgia, but the Mach-E’s numbers are nothing compared to the hype Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning EV has garnered.</p><p>The company’s F-150 electrification efforts have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds.html">hardly been an industry secret</a> but when <a href="http://v/">Ford debuted the Lightning</a> on May 19th (or May 18th if you were watching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">President Biden’s speech</a>), America’s car-buying public just about lost its mind with nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-pre-order-reservation-jim-farley-162653871.html">45,000 people signing up to preorder</a> the EV pickup within the first 48 hours.</p><div id="6a1621ebaf4146b4b0902711a82cd98b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More than 44,500 reservations in less than 48 hours...and counting.

The <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2021/08/23/fords-small-maverick-pickup-generates-big-reservation-numbers/8240567002/"><em>Detroit News</em></a> reported in August that more than 100,000 people had allegedly signed up to preorder the mini-truck, a large portion of which were California residents. Granted, those folks weren’t obligated to place a down payment so whether all those pre-orders translate into actual sales — or folks just decide to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html">restomod their existing ICE Fords with the eluminator system</a> instead — remains to be seen.</p><p>Some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">biggest headlines</a> in the 2021 EV truck space came from stellar startup, Rivian. While competitors like Lordstown Motors found themselves <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">critically low on cash</a> and the subject of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-investigation-lordstown-motors-184638125.html">Justice Department fraud investigations</a>, Rivian has already hit its first production milestone: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">actually producing vehicles</a> (despite having to push its initial delivery window from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html">July</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">September</a>). But that’s not the half of it.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, the company also announced plans to install 10,000 charging stations across <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-charger-network-us-canada-2023-210428781.html">North America by 2023</a>, unveiled <a href="http://v/">a membership plan for owners</a> offering both Roadside and off-Roadside Assistance as well as exclusive OTA software updates, and outlined its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-service-plan-143206646.html">Remote Care program</a> which would offer remote diagnoses and on-site repairs for the electric trucks. The startup has big plans for the future as well. It announced plans to invest $5 billion in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-second-factory-capacity-battery-cells-193825530.html">a second US-based production plant</a> and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-uk-ev-factory-plans-193124496.html">reportedly eyeing the UK</a> as the site for its first international battery facility.</p><p>Some of those future plans will involve partnerships with other companies such as Amazon — which owns a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-20-percent-stake-rivian-185007669.html">20 percent stake in Rivian</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-jeff-bezos-amazon-climate-change-paris-agreement.html">purchased 100,000 vehicles from the startup in 2019</a> and has already begun making deliveries in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-vehicles-are-making-deliveries-in-la-132506234.html">Los Angeles</a> with them — but they won’t include Ford. Despite investing half a billion dollars in the EV startup two years ago, Ford announced in November that the two companies will no longer collaborate on an upcoming EV. Looks like that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lincoln-cancels-rivian-based-ev-004105043.html">rumored electric Lincoln</a> will likely stay dead for the time being.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/89b35c80-5313-11ec-bcf5-af21cdef94e2" style="height:2744;width:4800;" alt="The Rivian R1T arrives on stage as a 2022 Truck of the Year Finalist at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California on November 17, 2021.

BROWN via Getty Images</div></figure><p>On the other end of the headline spectrum is, surprisingly, Tesla. Despite the company’s massively profitable year, the development of its Cybertruck has been slow going. While CEO Elon Musk announced in January that “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">volume production</a>” of the EV SUV will begin in 2022, <a href="http://v/">it’s increasingly looking like</a> that will happen later in the year — after Ford’s F-150 Lightning and GMC’s Hummer EV hit the roads, both of which debuted well after the Cybertruck did.</p><p>Of course, American automakers are far from the only ones getting in on the EV game. Mercedes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-will-launch-the-eqb-electric-ev-in-the-us-in-2022-084031973.html">announced in April</a> that its EQB compact SUV is nearly ready for production and will go on sale in the US next year. Its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-sustaineer-electric-delivery-van-concept-215050891.html">Sustainer</a>” delivery van concept, however, might take a bit longer to reach the market. Hyundai, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-striking-ioniq-5-delivers-long-range-and-brisk-performance-093212320.html">unveiled its Ioniq 5 SUV in February</a> with plans to release it this winter alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-genesis-brand-will-switch-entirely-to-electric-powertrains-in-2025-182802371.html">promises that its Genesis line of vehicles</a> will go entirely electric by the middle of this decade. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-2021-niro-ev-164152474.html">Kia’s Niro EV continues to be a low-key sleeper hit</a>.</p><p>We’ve seen much hype and grandiose promises about EV pickup trucks and SUVs over the last few years but 2022 will be the year when everything comes out in the wash. Consumers will finally be able to see these vehicles on the streets, in their neighborhoods, and likely breathing down their necks while stuck in traffic, rather than just on a showroom floor or livestream presentation stage. This is a huge opportunity for automakers to further evangelize the benefits of battery electrics over their internal combustion predecessors — this time using America’s favorite type of vehicle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2021-showed-us-that-trucks-and-suvs-dont-need-gas-engines-160020378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ba3c234-f081-40cb-82b3-ca83c10e60c8</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640260359</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum.

It will take around a month to reach its destination, after which researchers will be able to peek into black holes, observe some of the oldest galaxies in the universe and evaluate the habitability of various exoplanets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to develop the project. The JSWT has been beset by delays throughout its long history. NASA initially hoped to launch it in 2007, but spiraling costs prompted engineers to re-think the telescope in 2005. The JSWT was then declared ready <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">in 2016</a>, but the project was once again put on hold because of construction complications. The telescope was assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">in 2019</a>, but then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, leading to delays to testing and shipping.</p><p>After the JWST finally reached the spaceport, NASA set a launch date of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">December 18th</a>. However, it delayed the launch until today due to last-minute inspections and a lack of favorable weather. Still, what&#39;s a few days for such an important, long-in-the-works mission? The JWST is finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html">spacebound</a>, and in the coming months, we&#39;ll start to learn some of its discoveries.</p><div id="4a50182b90ba401a80585bae30870ee7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nT7JGZMbtM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-123452649.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415887ff-349f-47d0-8a28-20956352adda</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 12:34:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640435698</ingested><modified>2021-12-25T12:35:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alex-mit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch the James Webb Space Telescope launch at 7:20 AM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After far too many delays over the years to count, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has a launch date.

Last serviced in 2009, the telescope has had to enter the partial-shutdown “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/09/1020563/how-long-hubble-space-telescope-safe-mode-nasa/">safe mode</a>” multiple times over the last few years — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">most recently, this October</a>. And while optimistic estimates suggest that the Hubble could remain in operation through the end of the decade, NASA, with its ESA and CSA partners, have already spent more than a dozen years developing a successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When the Webb launches — currently set for liftoff on Christmas Day — it will take over as humanity’s preeminent eye in the sky for decades to come.</p><div id="6e44fa7e63df4dabafaf70403dc462ea"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9ZlqWp7620?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The 7.2-ton JWST will be the largest telescope NASA has ever put into orbit. Its 6.5-meter primary mirror array — composed of 18 gold-plated hexagonal segments — is more than twice the size of the Hubble’s and nearly 60 times larger in area than <a href="https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">the Spitzer Telescope</a>, which retired in 2020. The sun shield it uses to protect its delicate infrared sensors is nearly as long as a tennis court, and the telescope apparatus as a whole stands three stories tall. The 458 gigabits of data collected daily will be first routed through NASA’s Deep Space Network, then transmitted to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, which will collate and disseminate that information to the greater astronomy community.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it reaches its orbital home at the L2 Lagrange point 930,000 miles from Earth, the JWST will begin its four-point mission: searching for light from the earliest post-Big Bang stars; studying the formation and development of galaxies, examining the evolution of stars and planetary systems; and seeking out the origins of life.</p><div id="37f167ac56d344aa9b8bf8b0fd9e6bc7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YF22Ba-xrk8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To do so, the Webb will take a different approach from the Hubble before it. While the Hubble looked at the universe in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums, the JWST will see in infrared, just as the Spitzer used to but with far greater resolution and clarity. Using this infrared is critical to the Webb’s mission as that wavelength can peer through clouds of interstellar gasses and dust to see otherwise obscured objects beyond.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0921b340-5f62-11ec-bbf2-2556ac2d15a1" alt="look, it&#39;s all bolted together." data-uuid="acc58bab-1faa-3ae8-a2e5-768aeb093cad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA/Chris Gunn</div></figure><p>The Webb’s camera suite is made up of four individual components: the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph/Fine Guidance Sensor (NIRISS/FGS). These instruments are actually so sensitive that they can detect their own heat radiation when they’re operating. To minimize these infrared emissions, three of the sensors are chilled to negative 388 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees C). The especially sensitive MIRI is cooled even further to -448 degrees F (-266 degrees C) — that’s a mere 7 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero.</p><p>Getting the MIRI that cold is no easy feat. After the JWST makes its way into orbit, the telescope will spend weeks slowly chilling the sensor to its optimal operating temperature using a helium-based refrigeration system.</p><p>“It’s relatively easy to cool something down to that temperature on Earth, typically for scientific or industrial applications,” said JPL cryocooler specialist Konstantin Penanen in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-webb-telescope-will-have-the-coolest-camera-in-space">a recent NASA blog post</a>. “But those Earth-based systems are very bulky and energy inefficient. For a space observatory, we need a cooler that is physically compact, highly energy efficient, and it has to be highly reliable because we can’t go out and repair it. So those are the challenges we faced, and in that respect, I would say the MIRI cryocooler is certainly at the cutting edge.”</p><p>The extra effort that MIRI requires will be well worth it as ground-based infrared telescopes — especially those operating within the mid-infrared spectrum as MIRI is, are largely hampered by heat emissions from the devices themselves and the surrounding atmosphere.</p><p>“With the other three instruments, Webb observes wavelengths up to 5 microns. Adding wavelengths out to 28.5 microns with MIRI really increases its range of science,” George Rieke, professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/09/webbs-mid-infrared-instrument-is-ready-for-launch/">said earlier this month in a NASA blog</a>. “This includes everything from studying protostars and their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the energy balance of exoplanets, mass loss from evolved stars, circumnuclear tori around the central black holes in active galactic nuclei, and a lot more.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d129b280-5f61-11ec-9fba-305db3f007d3" alt="the Webb sunshield" data-uuid="feaef2ac-b3de-34fb-af23-76b826824168"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Given the JWST’s highly specific low temperature needs, keeping the telescope’s sensor suite out of direct sunlight (and blocked from other light sources like the Moon and Earth) is crucial. To ensure that those cameras are perpetually shaded, NASA engineers have built <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/sunshield.html">a five-layer sunshield</a> made from aluminum-coated Kapton film to keep them in the cold, cold dark.</p><p>&quot;The shape and design also direct heat out the sides, around the perimeter, between the layers,&quot; said James Cooper, the JWST’s Sunshield Manager at Goddard Space Flight Center. &quot;Heat generated by the Spacecraft bus at the ‘core,’ or center, is forced out between the membrane layers so that it cannot heat up the optics.&quot;</p><p>Measuring 69.5 feet by 46.5 feet by .001 inches, the kite-shaped sun shield is stacked five layers high so that energy absorbed by the top layer radiates out into space between them, making each successive layer slightly cooler than the one above it. In fact, the temperature difference at the outermost (383K, or 230 degrees F) and innermost layers (36K, about -394 degrees F) is roughly an order of magnitude.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a912f0e0-5f61-11ec-bede-40e608af0fb3" alt="the JWST is much bigger" data-uuid="45b0c15f-8e09-373c-9565-1a4811dde88b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>In order to collect enough light to view the fainest, most distant stars possible — some as far as 13 billion light years away — the JWST will rely on its massive 6.5m primary mirror array. Unlike the Hubble, which utilized a single 2.4m-wide mirror, the Webb’s mirror is divided into 18 individual segments, each weighing just 46 pounds thanks to their beryllium construction. They’re coated in gold to enhance their reflection of infrared light and hexagonal in shape so that, when fully assembled in orbit, they’ll fit together snugly enough to act as a single, symmetrical, gapless reflective plane. Their small size also allows them to easily be split up and folded down in order to fit within the tight confines of the Ariane 5 rocket they’ll ride into orbit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7a927dd0-5f61-11ec-b7fe-5953daf075b2" alt="The JWST aboard the Ariane 5" data-uuid="2d17469b-4832-32f4-91b2-82fb2f0e1d10"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ESA</div></figure><p>The role of coordinating these segments to focus on a single spot in a distant galaxy falls to the mirrors’ actuator assembly. Seven small motors sit on the backside of each mirror segment (one at each corner and a seventh in the middle), enabling precise control of their orientation and curvature. &quot;Aligning the primary mirror segments as though they are a single large mirror means each mirror is aligned to 1/10,000th the thickness of a human hair,” <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html">said</a> Webb Optical Telescope Element Manager, Lee Feinberg.</p><p>After 20-plus years of development and delays, costing $10 billion and involving the efforts of more than 10,000 people, the Webb Telescope is finally ready for launch — and hopefully this time it’ll actually take. The program has seen delay, after delay, after delay to its launch schedule. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coronavirus-delays-launch-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-161528305.html">NASA abandoned the initial date</a> of March 2021 in the wake of the initial COVID-19 outbreak and its associated lockdowns — though, to be fair, the GAO in January 2020 had <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-grim-gao-report.html">only given the JWST a 12 percent chance</a> of getting off the ground by the end of this year — and set a vague “sometime in 2021” timetable for its launch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/34b0d2c0-5f62-11ec-befd-5fab303b5e8d" alt="The Webb all folded up" data-uuid="fb704177-9389-36c4-8925-b328e642ac78"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-october-2021-120509662.html">later revised that estimate</a> to a firm “sometime in October 2021,” eventually settling on a Halloween launch window, only to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">delay it again</a> to late November/early December. Of course, early December quickly became late December, specifically <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">the 22nd</a>, which was then nudged back once again to its current date of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html">December 24th</a>. Actually, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-delays-james-webb-telescope-launch-poor-weather-132056161.html">make that the 25th</a>.</p><p>These delays have been caused by the myriad factors that go into getting an instrument of this size and sensitivity ready for launch. After completing its construction, the JWST had to undergo an exhaustive battery of tests, then be gently loaded into a shipping container and transported to its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana. Once there, the actual task of <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/12/10/webb-telescope-fueled-for-flight-ready-for-lifting-atop-launcher/">prepping, fueling, and loading the JWST onto an Ariane 5 rocket</a> took another 55 days.</p><div id="f4c7ffaa8ad843beaa103e43564a639e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bz03OnyD2A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>That timeline was further extended due to an “incident” on November 9th wherein, “a sudden, unplanned release of a clamp band — which secures Webb to the launch vehicle adapter — caused a vibration throughout the observatory,” per NASA. The <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/11/22/nasa-provides-update-on-webb-telescope-launch/">Webb’s anomaly review board initiated an additional round of testing</a> to ensure that those vibrations didn’t damage other components or knock anything important out of alignment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/609676b0-5f62-11ec-97ef-4785d602ba0f" alt="JWST deployment schedule" data-uuid="1980b4f9-3f24-3d86-b121-359581b2f435"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Now that the telescope <a href="https://spacenews.com/jwst-undamaged-from-payload-processing-incident/">has been deemed A-OK</a>, final preparations are underway.

That&#39;s the basic premise of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dont-look-up-trailer-netflix-213006741.html"><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em></a><em>, </em>the latest film from Adam McKay which premieres on Netflix today. It balances the blunt social commentary from his most recent Oscar nominated films (<em>The Big Short</em> and <em>Vice</em>), with the comic absurdity from his early hits, like <em>Anchorman</em> and <em>Talladega Nights</em>. The result is somewhat uneven and a bit too long, but it&#39;s also a battlecry against the anti-science, fact-phobic reality we&#39;re living through today.</p><p>The comet is an obvious metaphor for climate change, an apocalyptic scenario we&#39;re hurtling towards while governments drag their heels, the fossil fuel industry feigns ignorance and most people go about their lives oblivious about what&#39;s to come. But <em>Don&#39;t Look Up </em>also describes humanity&#39;s bumbling response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a global disaster that&#39;s led to more than five million deaths.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The film&#39;s title is a mantra used by a conservative president (Meryl Streep) to make her red-capped supporters look down at the ground, and not at the glowing comet in the sky they can easily see in the sky. It&#39;s hard not to be reminded of the politicization of COVID-19, which has led to people denying its existence and demonizing vaccines, all because of something they heard on Fox News or their family&#39;s Facebook group.</p><div id="a155c2abd76048b5a4f0ce39b8f4ce19"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbIxYm3mKzI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After two astronomers (played by a surprisingly nebbish Leonardo DiCaprio and a spunky Jennifer Lawrence) rush to the White House with news about Earth&#39;s impending destruction in six months, they&#39;re forced to wait. Streep&#39;s President Orlean is dealing with a potential scandal around a Supreme Court nominee, obviously that&#39;s more important. By the time they lay out Earth&#39;s impending doom, Orlean would rather wait and do nothing. &quot;What&#39;s this going to cost me? What&#39;s the ask in place?&quot; she says.</p><p>As the two scientists try to spread the word, first by leaking the doomsday scenario to the media, and then by becoming media personalities of their own, the film takes a scattershot aim at critiquing our modern society. The great Mark Rylance plays a Jobs-meets-Zuckerberg tech executive, the sort of mogul whose idea of innovation is a phone that&#39;ll constantly monitor you to fix negative emotions. (Feeling down? Bash Life will automatically book a nearby therapy session for you.) Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry pop up as cable news hosts who can only speak to their audience with faux, upbeat banter—yes, even if that news is about humanity&#39;s imminent destruction.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/534ec231-64c8-11ec-aff7-0d5d6675e034" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry in Don&#39;t Look Up" data-uuid="4e7b3bce-a43d-3f2d-affc-4b8b5b6485f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><p><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em> sometimes feels like it&#39;s punching down, especially when it&#39;s focusing on the sheer stupidity of President Orlean&#39;s conservative followers. But the film isn&#39;t afraid to criticize everyone, even its scientist leads. Both characters have trouble properly conveying the significance of their discovery. And when DiCaprio&#39;s astronomer finds his media legs, he&#39;s fully a part of the government propaganda machine.</p><p>By the time the American government finally decides to do something about the comet — only because it benefits the President, of course — it&#39;s dressed up in patriotic showmanship, as if Michael Bay were directing George W. Bush&#39;s tone deaf 2003 Mission Accomplished speech. I won&#39;t spoil where the movie goes from there, but it&#39;s clearly spoofing Bay&#39;s <em>Armageddon</em>.

What do we owe each other, as a civilization? And what will it take to protect this planet in the face of profit-seeking vampires, who would gladly risk humanity for a few more resources? Adam McKay doesn&#39;t have any answers.

The 15-inch <a href="https://amzn.to/3GY5N29">Echo Show 15</a>, available now, is by far the largest size Amazon has attempted, and it’s also notably the first Echo Show you can mount on your wall. Because of that, the company is betting some people will use it not just as a digital photo frame, but also as a family bulletin board. If that’s specifically what you want out of a smart display, the Echo Show 15 could be a niche but very fitting match. Somehow, though, we suspect that’s not most people.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c25e397a-04b4-4ab5-9b7a-c1705c0c779f"/><h2>Framed like a painting</h2><h2></h2><p>The Echo Show 15 looks like it belongs in a gallery. Its 15.6-inch screen is surrounded by a 0.7-inch white bezel (similar to the matting around a painting), which itself is housed in an elegant black metal enclosure. It’s also quite slim at only 1.4 inches thick. If you told me this was a picture frame, from far away I would probably believe you. The one telltale clue is the camera on the top left corner. You can hide it with a physical shutter using a toggle at the top edge of the frame, where you’ll also find volume controls and a microphone mute button.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since the Show 15 was designed to be hung on a wall, it comes with a mounting bracket along with the necessary hardware. (You’ll have to supply your own electric drill of course.) Amazon only supplies a five-foot electrical cord, though, so you’ll want to mount the device reasonably close to an outlet. Alternatively, you can also route the wire through the wall like you might with a TV, but that’s a more complicated setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/94558b70-6251-11ec-b8dd-406bb4adff83" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="8e15aaa5-acd0-3604-91ed-e137878d6438"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>You can choose to mount the Show 15 horizontally or vertically, but you can’t rotate it while it’s still on the wall. You’ll have to take it off, flip the bracket, then put the display back on. The same goes for a desktop stand; you’ll have to choose your preferred orientation before placing the Show 15 on it.</p><p>I didn’t want to drill into my walls (especially not to accommodate a device I’m merely borrowing for this story), so I opted to use the Sanus Tilt Stand that Amazon sent me for review. It’s fairly hefty and bulky, taking up considerable space on my kitchen counter. As its name suggests, the stand lets you tilt the Show up to 30 degrees for better viewing angles. It’s a decent alternative to wall hanging, but if I’m going to have a desktop Alexa-powered display, I’d probably choose one of the other Echo Shows as they’re smaller.</p><p>Still, the 15.6-inch screen here is the best out of all of the Echo Shows, with a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. The display is so bright and sharp that I can see it clearly across the room (about nine feet away). When it shows full-screen photos and pictures, the frame really does look like a piece of art. It reminds me of the Lenovo Smart Frame we saw at CES 2020, and even Samsung’s The Frame TV, except they’re both a lot bigger – the Lenovo Smart Frame has a 21.5.-inch display while the Frame TV lineup ranges from 32 to 85 inches. Plus, the Smart Frame only showed photos, while The Frame TV is a television that shows art, both of which lack Amazon’s smart display capabilities.</p><h2>Widgets galore</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/dcba0ea0-6241-11ec-9eb7-c1bedaa00752" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="0615c556-9386-3f75-b14f-48a5f51ff000"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of the sort, one of the key benefits of the large screen is Amazon’s latest Echo Show feature: widgets. Aside from the standard array of rotating home screen content like headlines and weather updates, part of the display can now be customized with tiles. Options include a calendar, a shopping list, sticky notes, to-do lists, the weather forecast, maps and an Amazon package delivery tracker. There’s also a “What to Eat” widget that houses recipe recommendations, restaurant delivery choices and Blue Apron meal kit suggestions.</p><p>This widgets feature will roll out to all Echo Shows eventually, but only the Echo Show 15 will have them persistently on the home screen. You can add as many widgets as you like, though the Echo Show 15 will only display up to six at a time, depending on the tile size. It also pushes the ones you use the most to the front, and you can rearrange them to your preference.</p><p>I found the widgets helpful to see all of my information at a glance. I made heavy use out of the “smart home favorites” widget, which lets me view my security cam feeds and control my smart lights with a single tap. I also liked the picture-in-picture live camera view, which allowed me to see who’s at the front door while watching a video.</p><p>Unfortunately, right now there aren’t many third-party widgets – just 14 at the moment. The company has said it’s built an API for developers to build their own widgets, but it’s unclear if more are coming soon. I would like to see a Spotify widget in addition to the one for Amazon Music, for example. Browser shortcuts for easier access to my favorite websites would also be helpful.</p><h2>Visual ID face recognition</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20474cf0-6242-11ec-bdef-79ba34e91847" alt="Echo Show 15" data-uuid="8d88d64a-3deb-364d-920b-cf9fcc12597c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Another feature making its debut on the Echo Show 15 is Visual ID, which is similar to Face Match on Google’s Nest Hub Max. It’s a face-recognition feature that shows you information and widgets that are personalized to you, like your day’s appointments or your to-do list. Whenever I came into view, the Echo Show 15 displayed  greetings like “Good morning, Nicole.” It’s smart enough to distinguish me from my husband, who it also recognized well. Visual ID also lets you send messages; when my husband told Alexa to “leave a note for Nicole that says ‘I love you’”, I saw it pop up on the screen later that day.</p><p>This feature won’t be unique to the Echo Show 15 for long; Amazon says the second-gen Echo Show 8 and the third-gen Echo Show 10 will also receive Visual ID through a future update. As for privacy concerns, the company says data for both Visual ID and Voice ID (which is already on all other Echo devices) is stored on the device, with nothing going to the cloud. But if you’re still feeling uneasy, you can simply disable both those features altogether. Additionally, you can view and delete your voice recordings on the Alexa app, if that makes you feel better.</p><h2>Disappointing camera quality</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0a023680-6247-11ec-8abf-e8ebc68cf66d" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="a1492efd-8275-373f-ba40-a490f491440f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Much of the Echo Show 15’s other features are on par with what Amazon offers across the rest of its smart display line, including the ability to set timers, stream music, control Alexa-compatible smart home devices and make video calls. In addition, it has plenty of streaming video options including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and even less obvious services like TikTok and Sling TV. That said, YouTube is only accessible via the browser, and the Show 15 doesn’t support Disney+ or HBO Max (which Google’s Nest Hub offers).</p><p>Even though Amazon supports video calls via Skype, the Alexa app or to anyone with an Echo device (Zoom support is coming in 2022), the Echo Show 15 inexplicably uses a subpar camera that’s not as sharp as the 13-megapixel sensors on the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 10. Plus, the Show 15 doesn’t offer Amazon’s auto-framing feature that keeps you centered in the scene.</p><p>Because the Echo Show 15 is so slim, I’m not surprised the audio quality is as mediocre as it is. It was fine for the occasional chill playlist, but there’s hardly any bass, so I would definitely not use this for entertaining guests.</p><h2>The competition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/54332200-6247-11ec-bcfd-81382e7dd580" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="c59e073e-346d-3de3-9541-04dda1d0c131"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s really nothing quite like the Echo Show 15 in terms of size. The closest is Facebook’s Portal+, which also measures 15.6 inches. But the Portal+ cannot be mounted on a wall and lacks many of the Echo Show’s apps and features. It also costs $50 more. That said, the Portal+ has a nicer camera with excellent video chat features, so it’s better for calls.</p><p>The Echo Show 15’s closest competitors are its own siblings, the Echo Show 8 and the Show 10. They all have the same features, except, again, the wall mountability. And yes, its larger display is better-suited for widgets on the home screen. That’s about the only real advantage, though, as Visual ID and widgets will be coming to the smaller Echo Shows too. The Show 8 and Show 10 also offer markedly better camera and audio quality. Sure, you’ll have to swipe to see the widgets, but that’s not a big hindrance. The Show 8 is also cheaper at $130 (the Show 10 is closer in price at $250).</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/beb2b440-6249-11ec-afff-710c2bcfc739" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="2b1ae196-e960-3b66-8f74-d97aa2b0a230"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Echo Show 15’s main advantage is that it can be mounted on a wall, and frankly, that’s the only reason to get it. Yes, the screen is beautiful and makes for a pretty digital photo frame, but the rest of its features aren’t better than the smaller Echo Shows. Plus, its camera is somehow even worse than on smaller Echo Show devices. Unless you’re really committed to the idea of having a smart display on your wall, you’re better off with one of Amazon’s other Echo Shows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">272c4d39-ed0c-454e-8e4e-55b937dac975</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 17:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640338078</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T09:28:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cab2530-6241-11ec-b5ae-0fe0e3321926" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cab2530-6241-11ec-b5ae-0fe0e3321926" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the global chip shortage isn't ending anytime soon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>News of the global chip shortage has been so far-reaching this year, it&#39;s become a meme. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I forgot to do the dishes, there&#39;s a global chip shortage.&quot; But as with many online jokes, there&#39;s a kernel of truth to it. The semiconductor chip crisis is real, and it&#39;s had a serious impact on our lives. Cars are more expensive and harder to build. Computer makers are rushing to keep up with an insatiable consumer demand for remote work and school devices. And <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html">countless products </a>have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html">been delayed</a>, with release dates being pushed like dominoes throughout 2021 and into the coming years.</p><p>While it&#39;s an issue that affects practically everyone, the chip shortage has been particularly painful for gamers. A year after the PlayStation 5&#39;s launch, it&#39;s still practically impossible to order one. (At least, not without paying an exorbitant markup, or following stock bots like a machine.) And PC players itching to upgrade their GPUs, who have already gotten used to dwindling hardware supplies and skyrocketing prices, will have to live with their old video cards a bit longer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Forrester Analytics&#39; Glenn O&#39;Donnell tells Engadget, the issue is mostly a simple supply and demand problem. You can point to several reasons for that: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-19/a-year-of-poor-planning-led-to-carmakers-massive-chip-shortage">carmakers lowered their hardware orders</a> at the start of the pandemic, with the assumption that consumers wouldn&#39;t be interested in buying new vehicles. It turns out the opposite was true – the overwhelming demand has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/used-car-prices-have-surged-how-to-make-that-work-to-your-advantage.html">pushed used car prices up significantly</a>. Chipmakers were also forced to keep up with a rising demand for PCs, game consoles and a wide assortment of gadgets while also dealing with production slowdowns amid COVID lockdowns and other precautions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e85f6f80-6407-11ec-baff-991e46471db3" alt="Xbox Series X and PS5" data-uuid="aba9f13d-fbcb-377a-9c6e-2bdfd794089a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;I&#39;d like to say things have improved, but they actually have gotten a little bit worse, and I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; O&#39;Donnell said in a recent interview with Engadget. In April, he argued that the <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-global-chip-shortage-wont-ease-soon/?utm_source=pr_pitch&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=tech_futurefit">global chip shortage would continue throughout 2022</a> and into 2023. Now, he&#39;s even more convinced that we won&#39;t see any major relief until then. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">future chip fabs from Intel</a>, TSMC and Samsung could boost supplies, it will still take at least two years from when those companies break ground to when they&#39;re up and running. Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-breaks-ground-two-new-leading-edge-chip-factories-arizona.html#gs.jh3hli">began construction on its two Arizona chip factories </a>in September, and it doesn&#39;t expect to have them operational until 2024.</p><p>Basically, get used to chip shortage, as we&#39;ll be suffering through it for a while. In an <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Intel-CEO-warns-chip-shortage-to-last-until-2023-as-demand-soars">interview with Nikkei last week</a>, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also confirmed that he expects the situation to last until 2023. &quot;COVID disrupted the supply chains, causing it to go negative,&quot; he said during a press event in Malaysia, where the company is investing $7.1 billion in manufacturing and packaging lines. &quot;Demand exploded to 20 percent year-over-year and disrupted supply chains created a very large gap ... and that exploding demand has persisted.&quot;</p><div id="eba7ae83d8cb40508d29560e347634b1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIzitZAah9A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed that sentiment in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-we-dont-have-any-magic-bullets-to-deal-with-chip-shortage-212549454.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL2hhcmR3YXJlL25ldy8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAO08GkuUA820cGNJzshMZlRikdCke-DZ99QPTTvTP98r_vaqeJthZDqih0NtVZU5M9LMktVzw24d1lyqUTeYidlFS84RxzxbUZaxzh9KotrNIZ8IwXMInla_mOKusZZrdJPx1VCGrmDIVxasczOuTsIdU67AVfVmyHF-FO1nMOz">a recent <em>Yahoo Finance</em> interview</a>, saying he doesn’t think there are any “magic bullets” when it comes to dealing with the supply chain. Huang also noted that NVIDIA’s own group of suppliers is multi-sourced and diverse, so the shortage shouldn’t dramatically affect the development of new products. But NVIDIA has also struggled to keep up with gamer demands even before the pandemic. Scalpers and cryptominers usually bought up all of the available stock, leaving average consumers with a limited amount of inventory from stores and resellers.</p><p>While Huang expects production to ramp back up in 2023, he also believes the pandemic-driven push towards buying more computers and gaming hardware is here to stay. “I think these are permanent conditions, and we’re going to see new computers being built for quite a while,” he told Yahoo. “People are building home offices, and you could see all of the implications.”</p><p>In the US, there’s a glimmer of hope that the Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which includes $52 billion in funding for the CHIPs for America Act, could spur on more semiconductor production. But after passing the Senate earlier this year, the legislation has stalled in the House of Representatives, where <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/dispute-over-china-tech-measure-235616022.html">Republican members said</a> they would block USICA. The bill also includes $190 billion towards improving American semiconductor R&amp;D, all in the hopes of becoming more competitive with China, which dramatically boosted its chip production over the last decade.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6be558bdc49b4b7ea6c378b497acb86f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/992d87b0-c350-11eb-befd-e9ed148a7507" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti"></section><p>The manufacturing conflict between the two countries came to a head this year, when the Biden administration reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html">discouraged Intel from ramping up its chip production in China</a>. And, of course, it doesn’t help that the US and China have been engaged in a quiet cyberwar for years. That’s despite the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-19-us-china-cyberwarfare-treaty-talks.html">agreement made between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> in 2015, where both leaders said they wouldn’t support or engage in online intellectual property theft. Most recently, the US, UK and security experts blamed China for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-email-server-exploited-30000-us-organizations-043324374.html">massive Microsoft Exchange hack earlier this year</a>, which infiltrated over 30,000 American companies.</p><p>Given the many obstacles in the way of fixing the chip supply chain, there’s one thing everyone may have to get used to: Just be prepared to live with your gear longer. O&#39;Donnell says he’s noticed corporate suppliers trying to eke out another year or two before they refresh their business machines. For gamers, there’s surely a healthy backlog of titles for your existing consoles, so don’t stress about not being able to grab that PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X so much. And despite the droolworthy benchmarks we’ve seen from NVIDIA’s new RTX 30-series cards, you can still play almost every major game on a 20-series GPU (and even many older ones!).</p><p>The chip shortage could conceivably stretch out this latest console generation, as well. But really, who knows what the gaming world will look like in five to seven years? The PS5 and Xbox Series X are already plenty fast, with support for 4K, 120FPS and a bit of ray tracing. And if we’ve learned anything from the success of the Switch, it’s that you can do <em>a lot</em> with aging hardware.</p><p>By 2026, it may also make more sense to stream games over the cloud, instead of demanding the fastest hardware possible under your TV. But even if the cloud ends up dominating the gaming landscape within the decade, it’ll still rely on servers, displays, accessories and powerful networking hardware to make it all possible.
