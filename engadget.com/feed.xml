The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-logitech-streamlabs.html">Logitech-owned</a> company has launched a monthly tipping service called <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers">Streamlabs Creator Subscription</a>, which (as you can probably guess from its name) gives streamers a way to set up a subscription service for viewers. Streamlabs says creators will get 100 percent of the tips fans give them after PayPal takes its usual processing fees.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643160/streamlabs-monthly-tipping-subscription-twitch-zero-fees"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, that makes Streamlabs Creator Subscription a more appealing option than Twitch&#39;s built-in service, which takes a 50 percent cut from the subscription fees streamers get. Especially since Streamlabs&#39; new tipping tool can be directly integrated into its popular OBS software suite anyway. The OBS software can be used to stream not just on Twitch, but also on YouTube, Facebook and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-streamlabs-live-streaming-integration-165006138.html">TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Streamlabs will let creators decide on what kind of subscription service they want to offer their fans, and they can also set specific price points. If they choose, however, they can allow viewers to choose how much to contribute every month. Fans will get &quot;redeemable alerts&quot; in exchange for their contributions, and they can use those if they want their favorite streamer to thank them on screen. Streamlabs will also be adding leaderboards and badges in the coming weeks to encourage fans to support their favorite creators.</p><p>Ashray Urs, Head of Product at Streamlabs, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As the live streaming industry has grown, so has the need for a sustainable revenue model. Currently, most major streaming platforms provide viewers with a way to subscribe to a channel; however, they usually split the revenue from the subscription in half between the creators and platform. In addition, platforms require a creator to meet certain qualifications before they can unlock the ability for viewers to subscribe. Streamlabs Creator Subscription is open for anyone with a Streamlabs tip page, regardless of size or how often they stream.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-creator-subscription-095053962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49cddcfc-c663-4967-97ee-b4bdedf305b0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:50:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630055685</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T09:14:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[fpphotobank via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Puma is releasing official 'Animal Crossing' sneakers and clothing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo&#39;s colorful, character-filled island life sim <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>lends itself to merchandise collabs.

Apple says it will release an ‚Äúannual transparency report‚Äù that will ‚Äúshare meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.‚Äù</p><p>There are other changes that are meant to give developers more flexibility in setting their prices. Apple says it will increase the number of price points available to app makers from ‚Äúfewer than 100 to more than 500.‚Äù Those changes are expected by the end of next year, according to <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement">a statement</a> from attorneys representing the developers. Additionally, Apple agreed as part of the settlement to keep in place the changes it originally said were in response to COVID-19 that reduced commissions to 15 percent for developers making less than $1 million a year. That change will now be in effect for ‚Äúat least the next three years.‚Äù</p><p>The changes are in response to a class action lawsuit that dates back to 2019.

According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nes-and-snes-designer-lance-barr-is-retiring-from-ninte-1847561525"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, NES and SNES designer Lance Barr has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/08/the_designer_of_the_nes_and_snes_has_retired_from_nintendo_after_almost_40_years">retired</a> from Nintendo after 38 years and eight months at the company. Although relatively few know his name, he may have played a key role in obtaining mainstream acceptance for Nintendo and reinvigorating the video game industry in the US.</p><p>Barr joined Nintendo in a part-time role in December 1982, but he made his biggest mark when he was asked to design the outside of the NES to make the Famicom more palatable for American audiences. As requested, he made it look like it belonged next to a stereo system (complete with a VHS-style cartridge loader) compared to the &quot;soft&quot; Japanese model. The console&#39;s final look was rushed, though ‚Äî while the prototype NES at CES was a sleek wireless machine, Barr and his team spent an hour reworking the device based on both a poor CES reaction and cost-cutting engineering demands. One of the most recognizable pieces of electronics in the past four decades was the product of a quick rework, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Barr was influential well beyond those two early consoles. He designed key NES accessories, including the Zapper light gun and NES Max. And while Nintendo headquarters took the design reins in the mid-1990s, Barr left his stamp on the 2000s as well ‚Äî he was involved in the design of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-25-nintendo-wii-shipments-end-europe.html">the Wii</a> and its legendary Nunchuk add-on controller.</p><p>In that light, Barr helped shape Nintendo&#39;s overall hardware design language: simple, sturdy and instantly recognizable. Nintendo appears to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-october-sales-053456267.html">in good hands</a> without Barr, but his departure still marks the end of a long and important era.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-designer-lance-barr-retires-145657155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ae46412-2468-4f23-8f9b-3ce730aa0062</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:56:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629989775</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T14:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19515170-0676-11ec-bf78-003ce28e17e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19515170-0676-11ec-bf78-003ce28e17e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jason Leung on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NES game console]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NES game console]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero review: HP's lightest laptop yet deserves a closer look]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HP, the world‚Äôs second-largest PC vendor by market share, says that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pavilion Aero 13" href="https://fave.co/3B6S9Xp">Pavilion Aero 13</a> is designed for Generation Z. Youthful, vibrant <em>post-teens</em> who love entertainment, communication and ‚Äî COVID notwithstanding ‚Äî travel. It‚Äôs ironic, then, that when you examine this machine from that perspective, it becomes a less attractive proposition. This is actually a pretty nice laptop, but I doubt it‚Äôs top on any Zoomer‚Äôs wish list.</p><h3><strong>Hardware</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b6a11f90-00eb-11ec-beef-ddff13440656" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="d282d0f5-decc-3cb2-9fd6-28072400d29e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-laptop-m-series-monitors-130032913.html">focus</a> here is on making a machine that is as thin and light as possible while still offering a decent amount of power and connectivity. Weighing 2.2 pounds, about the same as the 14-inch LG Gram, the Aero is HP‚Äôs first low-end machine to pack a taller 16:10 display. It carries a pair of USB-A ports with kick-out covers, HDMI-out and a single USB-C socket alongside a 3.5mm audio jack and the barrel power connector. I‚Äôm still torn over the throwback power connector, which on one hand is acceptable and cost-effective, but, again, does your average Gen-Zer not want to minimize the number of chunky charging plugs they‚Äôre carrying around?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Build quality is solid, with no flex or creaks when you hold it open with one hand and wave it around. The one place where I‚Äôll take marks off is in the display hinge, which is designed to push the laptop deck up off the table like ASUS‚Äô ZenBook. It just feels a <em>little</em> bit less sturdy than you might expect, which you‚Äôll need to be mindful of if you rest your weight too much on the front of your hands. The malleability of that hinge feels just weak enough to make me paranoid.</p><h2><strong>Keyboard and trackpad</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/10b65770-00ec-11ec-beff-89a1d3d44fef" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="fced83d8-0e8b-3085-8193-65bd57859bb9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Pavilion Aero 13‚Äôs keyboard is well-engineered and satisfying, with a fair level of travel and a good hit at the end of your press. Interestingly, you need to pony up extra for a model with backlighting, which is either miserly or smart cost-cutting, depending on your perspective. It may not be the same quality as HP‚Äôs higher-priced laptops but it‚Äôs certainly not a chore to write with.</p><p>Except for, and I am being needlessly grouchy here, HP‚Äôs inclusion of a function row along the rightmost side of the keyboard. Most 13-inch laptops, for obvious reasons, try to cut down on superfluous keys that you may only find on more spacious models. And that‚Äôs fine, because it‚Äôs rare that I ever find myself needing to use Home/Pg Up/Pg Down/End when I have other keyboard shortcuts (and, you know, a trackpad) available.</p><p>I get why HP insists on using them here, but it means that you‚Äôll have a learning curve when coming off pretty much every other laptop in this class. And, if I were king, I would have opted for a standard layout with more breathing room, not to mention full-size up/down keys with more space around them. After more than a week using this thing, I‚Äôm still hitting the home key instead of backspace, dramatically slowing my typing speed, much to my frustration.</p><p>As for the trackpad, it‚Äôs bigger than on the 2020 model that this replaces, and has a decent click with tolerable accuracy. The lack of a touchscreen on this laptop isn‚Äôt, in my opinion, a huge issue given its size and class, so long as the trackpad is solid. And this trackpad is very much that, and there‚Äôs not much else to say about it as a consequence.</p><h2><strong>Display, sound and webcam</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/827d14c0-00ec-11ec-afff-ae16491bf2aa" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="33c237ac-9101-31ca-ae9a-fe0659c9b2f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>This machine carries a 13.3-inch HD display, although because of its 16:10 ratio, that 1,920 x 1,200 resolution is actually WUXGA. I don‚Äôt think anyone would need a 4K display on a machine like this, but you can configure it with a WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) screen should you need to. The 400-nit panel can balance any strong summer light, and the matte screen means that you avoid a lot of glare.</p><p>The downward-firing B&amp;O-branded speakers hidden under the edges of the laptop deck provide acceptable audio. They sound a little better than on some ultrabooks I could mention, but it‚Äôs still thin and reedy, with tinny equalization presets and nonexistent bass. This is audio you can put up with rather than enjoy during all of those Netflix and Chill sessions where you actually watch Netflix and Chill.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d8539180-00ec-11ec-bee7-4a0ba9972e7b" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="074f82d5-0aa0-3379-9b77-0a6b9403605e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Perhaps I‚Äôve been reviewing too many laptops of late that have some sort of webcam shutter, but the omission here surprises me. The HP WideVision 720p HD camera is at least sharp enough that people can see your face properly when you‚Äôre using it. Even better, it handles most light well enough that blow-outs are occasional rather than ever-present, which is good considering how much we all need to Zoom each other right now.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><h3></h3><p>One thing to note is that HP pre-installs a number of apps onto its laptops, including McAfee, LastPass and ExpressVPN. This means you‚Äôll start getting pop-ups after installing Chrome, telling you that plugins are about to be installed. That I think this is an unacceptable thing to happen, even for a relatively low-cost laptop, should go without saying.</p><h2><strong>Performance and battery life</strong></h2><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>PC Mark 10</p></td><td><p>3D Mark Night Raid</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5 Compute</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HP Pavilion Aero 13.3 (2021) AMD Ryzen 7 5800U w/ Radeon Integrated, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>5,775</p></td><td><p>12,799</p></td><td><p>14,960</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15&quot; (2021), AMD Ryzen 7 MS w/ Radeon Integrated, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>4,620</p></td><td><p>15,517</p></td><td><p>11,909</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 15&quot;, Intel Core i7 1165G7 w/ Intel Xe, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>4,648</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>16,659</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Both Intel and AMD have made enormous strides toward integrated graphics units that don‚Äôt suck. This is thunderingly relevant in the ultrabook market where thinness and portability are prized over pretty much everything else. After all, even a few years ago you couldn‚Äôt have done much more on a machine of this class beyond mash the odd spreadsheet. Now you can expect passable, even quite pleasant performance on a wide variety of tasks, from intensive Chrome browsing to video games.</p><p>The model that HP sent to reviewers retails for $999, and includes AMD‚Äôs Ryzen 5800U with Radeon Integrated Graphics, which packs 512MB of dedicated DDR4 VRAM. Rounding out the spec list is 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, which sits on the higher end of what you can expect to get for this sort of money. Certainly, the benchmarks make this thing look a lot less powerful, but I suspect the Aero simply isn‚Äôt set up for intensive gaming. It‚Äôs worth saying that even the fan noise isn‚Äôt that aggressive under heavy load, too.</p><p>That said, I was able to play<em> Fortnite</em> pretty smoothly on this machine with the graphics set to Medium, and an evening‚Äôs marathon session of<em> Two Point Hospital </em>passed without comment. Certainly, if you are happy with undemanding titles, you‚Äôll be able to squeeze a lot of fun from this machine.<em> GTA V‚Äôs</em> benchmarking tool was able to produce a fairly consistent 30fps, and if you dial down all of the visuals, you can get this running fast enough to play <em>in a pinch</em>.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>Battery Life</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HP Pavilion Aero 13.3 (2021)</p></td><td><p>9:43</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Nano</p></td><td><p>9:14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360</p></td><td><p>15:20</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Battery life is similarly resilient, with this machine clocking in at 9 hours and 43 minutes in our standard rundown test. When untethered from power, I didn‚Äôt feel any nagging urgency to head back to a socket while using this thing, and you should expect this to last for the length of your working day. And, to be honest, if this had conked out any sooner I would be screaming from the rooftops about it, since the whole point of an ultraportable is, after all, to be portable.</p><h2><strong>Price and the competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2c4e4960-00ed-11ec-afde-20964270a7e3" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="9f497013-2c16-3def-a02a-18cb86e08b74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>As I said, the model I‚Äôm <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/laptops/pavilion/pavilion-aero-13-laptop.html">testing costs $999</a>. That‚Äôs a fair price, especially if you try to configure a similar spec list with some rival machines in the same category. There are some alternatives, and if your priority is a slender, lightweight machine, then <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:LG&#x002019;s Gram 14" href="https://bit.ly/2WuSLrd">LG‚Äôs Gram 14</a> can be picked up for $799.99. It has a 14-inch WUXGA display and weighs 2.2 pounds. Sadly, its specs fall far short of HP‚Äôs offering, with an Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. You could also opt for <a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM260000011/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-7-5700U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS71">ASUS‚Äô ZenBook 13 OLED</a>, which packs a Ryzen 7 5700U, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and an OLED display for $899.99.</p><p>If you‚Äôre feeling picky, you could do worse than to wait for more AMD-toting laptops to enter retail channels in the near future. I expect that we‚Äôll see models similar to Lenovo‚Äôs ThinkPad X13 and Acer‚Äôs Spin 3 with comparable internals coming very soon. At which point, you should have your pick of any number of high-quality machines that can do jobs similar to this one.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3cb2c240-00ed-11ec-bf9d-65596459b146" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="5dc46138-2498-33cd-98c2-9449467928b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>This isn‚Äôt a fair comparison at all, but in my head I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">Dell‚Äôs XPS 13</a> which, for many people, is either the gold-standard ultrabook, or in the top three. And, right now, that on both specs and price, the Pavilion Aero 13 is a more compelling choice. When you look at the base model XPS 13, which starts $1,019.99, the only thing that HP loses out on is aesthetics. In almost every other regard, I‚Äôd much rather have this Pavilion Aero than the XPS and that, to me, is<em> wild</em>.</p><p>I think the Pavilion Aero 13 is a very good machine, with a solid thin-and-light body and performance that punches well above its weight. For some people, the 5800U running the show is enough of a reason to buy one of these that everything else is broadly immaterial. Do I wish it was priced a little more aggressively? Yes, because I could forgive the learning curve with the keyboard if it was a hundred bucks cheaper. Despite the keyboard and sound, though, it‚Äôs a good machine for folks who want a little bit of everything.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a5e7e68-e438-40c8-b1f3-0386641f8c55</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630002800</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T18:33:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" width="1852" height="1191" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" width="1852" height="1191" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Gaming's free titles for September include 'Knockout City']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is adding more titles to the list Prime Gaming subscribers can claim for free starting on September 1st.

With the Series 6 setting users back $400, Apple brought the more affordable Watch SE into its lineup so those with tighter budgets could get the same, core Apple Watch experience. Now you can pick up a Watch SE for even less at Amazon while a couple of models are on sale. Key among them is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:44mm, GPS + Cellular Apple Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/3mBEIdR">44mm, GPS + Cellular Apple Watch SE</a> in silver for $300 ‚Äî that&#39;s $59 off its normal price and a record low.

The Watch SE <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">performed well</a> in our testing, despite running on an older processor than the one found in the Series 6, and it has all of the core features of watchOS 7 including heart rate monitoring with high and low alerts, noise monitoring, fall detection, Emergency SOS and more. The fitness features are almost identical to that of the Series 6 ‚Äî the only things you don&#39;t get on the SE are blood oxygen and ECG measurements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You also don&#39;t get the always-on display that the Series 6 has, but the Watch SE has the same size display, which is noticeably larger than that of the old Series 3. And with these models on sale, you&#39;re getting cellular connectivity ‚Äî that means you can make and receive calls, send text messages and more even when your iPhone isn&#39;t around. The Apple Watch is still very much an iPhone accessory, but those with LTE will get the most untethered experience.</p><p>Even though you have to give up a few features with the Apple Watch SE, you&#39;re still getting one of the best smartwatches available today. But we&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that Apple may be coming out with new models soon. We typically see new Apple Watches announced along with the latest iPhones in September, but there&#39;s no guarantee a new Watch SE will make the lineup this year.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-44mm-cellular-deal-59-off-amazon-131506828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a7ad755-5832-46db-8603-eedec39d71a0</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 13:15:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629983063</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T13:04:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/dc958f30-4145-11eb-878f-40f17f10cb63" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/dc958f30-4145-11eb-878f-40f17f10cb63" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Apple Watch SE (44mm with cellular) is down to $300 at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rock's new Under Armour over-ear headphones pack ANC and a 45-hour battery life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fans of celeb-endorsed gadgets rejoice.
