Sometimes, they&#39;ll work for any customer with a large-enough bank account. <em>The Record</em><a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-mercenary-group-void-balaur-has-been-hacking-companies-for-years/">reports</a> that Trend Micro has <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-far-reaching-attacks-of-the-void-balaur-cybermercenary-group">identified</a> Void Balaur, a &quot;cybermercenary&quot; group that has struck both political and commercial targets since 2015. It primarily steals data to sell to whoever&#39;s willing to pay, whether that&#39;s a government or a fraudster.</p><p>Void Balaur was initially linked to attacks against human rights activists and journalists in Uzbekistan. More recently, it attacked Belarusian presidential candidates in 2020 and several political leaders in an unnamed Eastern European country. However, the hacking outfit also targeted executives and directors at a very large Russian company between 2020 and 2021, and has been attacking and selling data from telecoms, banks and cryptocurrency users. The group has been linked to the on-demand hacking site RocketHack.me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear just where Void Balaur operates from, or whether it has official government support. There&#39;s some overlap between Void&#39;s targets and those of the Russia-backed APT28 (aka <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fancy-bear-reportedly-hacked-us-agency-213304085.html">Fancy Bear</a> or Pawn Storm), but not enough to establish a clear link. And while the group has only ever advertised its services on Russian-language sites, it&#39;s not necessarily operating from Russia. We&#39;d add that Russia usually turns a blind eye to cybercriminals only so long as they don&#39;t attack Russian interests — Void doesn&#39;t have problems attacking Russian businesses.</p><p>The study illustrates the difficulty in pinpointing the nature of some hackers, let alone catching them. Cybermercenaries also pose a particularly severe threat as they&#39;re often happy to attack any target without reservations. It won&#39;t be surprising if there are more groups like Void Balaur that have simply gone undetected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/void-balaur-cyber-mercenary-hacking-group-163522871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f73ca4-4b39-4867-87b3-7f715e65e114</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 16:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636562126</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T16:35:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Witthaya Prasongsin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of hands typing on laptop.

Whether they’re a painter, writer, musician or anything else. Something to get their creative juices flowing will be welcome. Trust us. There are countless ways to spur creativity and aid the creative process — many of which <a href="https://makingmusic.ableton.com/">don’t require spending any money</a>, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/headspace-new-york-state-of-mind-website-205305471.html">meditation</a> or simply taking a long walk. But there are tools out there that can help someone stretch beyond their comfort zone, or simply document and fine-tune their own ideas. From subscriptions, to books, to extremely bizarre instruments, here are the best gifts for the creative in your life.</p><h2><em>You Are an Artist </em>by <strong>Sarah Urist Green</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c46440-2dd2-11ec-ba9d-5a9250b7b827" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="1f7fd47c-32f1-3721-8688-e65bff503ba4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget / Penguin Books</div></figure><p>It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes just being told what to do is a great way to spur creativity. Because, truth is, rarely is the actually creative part in the original idea, but rather in the execution of it. The problem is, once someone leaves school nobody is giving them assignments any more. That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:You Are an Artist" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD"><em>You Are an Artist</em></a> comes in, a book compiled by Sarah Urist Green, the host of PBS’ <em>The Art Assignment</em> on YouTube. It’s a collection of 50 assignments crafted by a diverse set of artists to help get the creative on your list, well, creating.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the assignments focus on visual arts, asking them to make endless copies of an image using a Xerox machine, or to take random photos of a location and make notes on details they might normally miss. But there are others that encourage them to hum or clap along with the sounds of traffic, or engage in word games. <em>You Are an Artist</em> is the sort of book they’ll probably revisit time and time again. <em>— Terrence O&#39;Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD" id="ebdc0efcf41a4b96a31447574ff763d4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy You Are an Artist at Amazon - $13</a><h2>Apple Pencil (second-gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/1557e020-c608-11ea-9e7e-db158d5192d4" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple Pencil 2nd generation" data-uuid="b370310d-93cd-4148-96e6-15a2ed508a46"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPad has become a key tool for creatives over the years and arguably nothing has contributed to that more than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Pencil" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16">Apple Pencil</a>. Most of the newest iPads support the second-generation Pencil and it’s admittedly much more convenient than the first purely for its magnetic charging method. But otherwise, the Apple Pencil is the best stylus I’ve ever used because it has little to no latency and that helps mimic the feeling of drawing with a traditional pen and paper.</p><p>While investing in a paper-like screen protector will blur the lines even further, you don’t have to do that to get an excellent experience from the Apple Pencil. Drawing is seamless, taking notes is a breeze (especially with iPadOS 15 if you use Apple’s Notes app) and the possibilities are endless once you get familiar with third-party programs like Procreate. Battery life is superb, too: I’ve spent hours drawing in Procreate or experimenting with different planner layouts in GoodNotes and I have yet to pause a session to recharge the Pencil. While the Apple Pencil hasn’t completely replaced traditional art forms for me, it’s certainly the most useful tool I own for when I want to be creative. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16" id="af4bccea0e4243e7a02e607070d024c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple Pencil (2nd gen) at Amazon - $129</a><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite smart typewriter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c0bac0-2dd2-11ec-b6dc-a6b13463d287" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="64d9f49b-d71e-3c80-9bf6-6011ef8b6cd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dan Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://fave.co/3lxet7w">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> is a niche device that would nonetheless make a wonderful present for any aspiring writer. Or, come to think of it, anyone who is already committed to the art of putting words to the page. The Freewrite combines an excellent mechanical keyboard with an E Ink display, and while it can get online to sync drafts to the web, that&#39;s the only thing it can do. There&#39;s no way to browse the web, play a game, or watch YouTube on the Freewrite, which makes it a lot easier to just sit down and get into a flow state. The E Ink screen and keyboard can take a little getting used to, but both things quickly become assets when just looking to get some writing done. And thanks to the low-power display, the Freewrite lasts for a week or two of heavy writing. At $600, it&#39;s a serious investment — but gifting one to an aspiring writer should give them great motivation to write that book they&#39;re always talking about. <em>— Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Managing Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3lxet7w" id="9e0850c0bbde44d98e6d1291bd3080cf" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Freewrite;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Smart Typewriter at Freewrite - $600</a><h2>Factory Records: The Complete Graphic Album</h2><h2>Mute: A Visual Document: From 1978 - Tomorrow</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c093b0-2dd2-11ec-b9fb-6e9a7565e199" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="59476a8a-cbac-3436-a4a3-63a221edb755"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Thames &amp; Hudson</div></figure><p>Decades worth of record label design offers a wellspring of visual aesthetics to kickstart your own creativity. There are even a few monoliths of music and design culture that succeeded in the record industry without succumbing to the corporate machine. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Factory" href="https://amzn.to/3BFb9Ns">Factory</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Mute" href="https://amzn.to/3iQAwEw">Mute</a> records are such creatures. Spawned in the UK in the late ‘70s (though only Mute remains today), both companies informed generations through tales of — sometimes careless — business tactics and quality curated output. In general, they were groups driven by a DIY aesthetic and creativity unhindered by official structure.</p><p>Not only did these labels champion freedom of musical expression and help drive new genres of music, but they also became an outlet for visual designers.

That’s probably the most straightforward way to describe this book, which walks you through a 12-week program of writing exercises and tasks, all aimed at freeing up your creative powers. The crux of it is demanding three pages of handwritten writing every day. While it’s often a stream of consciousness — and if your handwriting is atrocious, barely legible — Cameron’s advice is to simply put the writing out there, and see where it takes you. Famous fans include <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and practically half of the comedians whose podcasts I listen to, it seems. The book does get a little bit spiritual at times, which you may or may not be fine with, but the core exercises and ideas can be pretty powerful, especially if you’re in a creative rut, or simply looking to add more artistic output to your day-to-day life. <em>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YKjwc8" id="e7c321ea740a4676873d9d320830fec9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy The Artist&#39;s Way at Amazon - $25</a><h2>Moog Subharmonicon</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c1f340-2dd2-11ec-ae77-5f2d8cdfd31a" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="028ed964-5764-3564-85c8-7d0bb2a5089a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>Another slightly weird instrument to consider is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Moog Subharmonicon" href="https://amzn.to/3FErV1x">Moog Subharmonicon</a>.

But there are far more interesting ways to find sounds. For one, search results can be shuffled. So, rather than just using the same Rhodes sample that thousands of other bedroom producers have relied on, a person can hit the shuffle button and grab something that might be flying under the radar. This technique can also be combined with searching for random terms on Splice, rather than pulling up specific instruments. (Just Google “random word generator” and use that as the basis for a search.) There are lots of interesting and sometimes strange sounds and loops to be found by searching for things like “clinic” and “preparation.”</p><p>The entry-level $10 Sounds+ plan includes 100 sample credits.

One of our favorites is the Nest Hello (now called the Nest Doorbell Wired), which is why we were pleased when Nest came out with a new battery-operated version, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Nest Doorbell Battery" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnjvkO">Nest Doorbell Battery</a>. It’s a great gift for both homeowners and renters, as you don’t need to hardwire it. Battery life is anywhere from one to six months depending on how active it is (it’s shorter if you live on a busy street, for example). The Doorbell notifies them whenever there’s a person, animal or vehicle near the front door. It can also let them know when a package has been placed, which is great for pre-empting theft. In addition, it offers three hours of event video history for free, with the option to purchase more space through a Nest Aware subscription.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnjvkO" id="b485f059051746e195fea7a0cf3d32e5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Doorbell Battery at Best Buy - $180</a><h2>Google Nest Hub (2nd gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/68cf0f30-422b-11ec-be6e-34dc44ff22f2" alt="Nest Hub (2nd gen) for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

The two are designed to work together: anytime someone rings the doorbell, the camera view of who’s at the front door will show up on the Nest Hub’s screen. Even without the doorbell, however, the smart display is a great device to have around the home — especially if your loved one already uses the Google Assistant. It works as a digital photo frame and they can use it to watch YouTube and Netflix. It can also make calls via Google Duo and offers recipe videos along with step-by-step cooking instructions.

It’s a problem that <a href="https://www.omorpho.fit/">Omorpho</a> is looking to tackle with its new Gravity Sportswear, which spreads the weight across the garment. The rationale for this, and the use of what it’s calling MicroLoad Spheres which are dotted all over like Michael B. Jordan’s torso from <em>Black Panther</em>, is to offer greater resistance during workouts, but not at the expense of movement.</p><p>Omorpho may be a new company but it comes from some pretty experienced names, since it was founded by 21-year Nike veteran Stefan Olander. He is joined by a group of former Nike employees which have worked to build the clothes and finesse this system of weighting clothes. The process of developing the garments has reportedly taken more than three years, and uses premium fabrics in the construction. And there are a number of big-name athletes pitching the clothes, including Julio Jones and Annie Kunz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The entire collection, which includes long and short-sleeve tops, vests and leggings, is available to buy from <a href="https://www.omorpho.fit/">Omorpho&#39;s</a> website today.

Today the company is massively updating how you block another user on its platform, giving you the ability to do so yourself for the first time. Before now, you had to contact customer service to get the job done, but now you can complete the task on Spotify app from a desktop or mobile device.&nbsp;</p><p>Users have been clamoring for a way to directly block others for quite some time. In 2018, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-18-spotify-slowly-warms-up-to-user-blocking-feature.html">designated a block feature</a> as a &quot;good idea,&quot; although it wasn&#39;t officially on a product roadmap and no timeline for arrival was given. In 2019, Spotify began allowing users to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-22-spotify-dont-play-artist-feature-ios-android.html">block artists</a> they never wanted to hear with a &quot;Don&#39;t play this artist&quot; option.

Select &quot;Block,&quot; or &quot;Block User&quot; on mobile, and that person will no longer be able to access your page, public playlists or see your listening activity. As you might expect, there&#39;s an &quot;Unblock&quot; option should you ever change your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify says the introduction of a direct blocking feature is part of its ongoing mission to give users the best experience it can while fostering a safe environment for them to listen to music and podcasts. You can expect the new functionality to start rolling out this week.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-block-user-140005922.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be0fb16d-5a45-487c-81e5-4e48194ff36b</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 14:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636551057</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T13:30:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf1ba90-4229-11ec-9cbf-df4801b4cb67" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3cf1ba90-4229-11ec-9cbf-df4801b4cb67" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gadgets for your pets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether they be cat or dog lovers, Engadget’s editors have our fair share of fur babies.

Back then, the commission decided after a lengthy investigation that the tech giant favored its own comparison shopping services and unfairly directed users to its own products over those of its rivals&#39;. That $2.8 billion fine is just a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#39;s (Google&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/alphabet-hits-2-trillion-market-value-after-71-rally-this-year?sref=10lNAhZ9">$2 trillion valuation</a>, but it was the biggest financial penalty the commission has ever handed out.</p><p>&nbsp;The court said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The General Court finds that, by favoring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favorable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms, Google departed from competition on the merits.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While the General Court mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/google-loses-battle-with-eu-as-court-upholds-2017-order.html">sided</a> with the commission&#39;s findings that Google&#39;s actions had harmful effects on comparison shopping, it disagreed with one element of the EU&#39;s case. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-loses-eu-shopping-ads-case-appeal-11636539480"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> noted, it said that regulators weren&#39;t able to prove that the company&#39;s conduct harmed competition among general search engines.</p><p>Back when it appealed the EU&#39;s decision, Google argued that the commission ignored the competition it faces in the e-commerce sector from Amazon. The company could appeal the General Court&#39;s decision yet again by taking the case to the EU&#39;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. A spokesperson told <em>The Journal</em>, however, that the company will still have to review the judgment more closely before deciding whether to file another appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-loses-appeal-eu-antitrust-comparison-shopping-125544574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1fcef97-c741-4ff7-96d1-548568599aa2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636548973</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T12:56:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PierreOlivierClementMantion via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dublin, Ireland - February 12, 2019: Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google on a winter day]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Peloton reveals its smart camera for strength training]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can’t keep a fitness company down.

You can tell your robot vacuum to start and stop cleaning, or to set up a schedule, but the entire interaction is, well, <em>robotic</em>. That changes today with iRobot&#39;s latest Alexa Skill, which taps into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">company&#39;s Genius software platform</a> to deliver smarter and more conversational voice commands.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to tell Wi-Fi connected Roombas to clean around specific objects, and you can schedule cleaning jobs without sounding like you&#39;re inputting a computer program. As iRobot CEO Colin Angle tells us, the Alexa Skill is one of the most complex ever created. You can even tie a bunch of commands together, even across iRobots vacuums and Bravaa mop. For example, you can shout &quot;Alexa, tell Roomba to clean my dining room every Sunday at 4PM <em>and</em> then run Bravaa.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, iRobot&#39;s devices will also be able to use Alexa speakers to send announcements about cleaning jobs. Sure, the company&#39;s app already sends you phone notifications, but it&#39;s easy to miss those if you&#39;re cleaning up the house while Roomba works. iRobot devices can also tap into Alexa&#39;s AI-driven Hunches to start cleaning jobs if it thinks you aren&#39;t home. (Hopefully, there&#39;ll be plenty of control about how exactly that feature works.)</p><p>According to Angle, iRobot has a fundamental belief that you&#39;re supposed to be able to talk to your robots, and &quot;do so in a natural and sophisticated fashion.&quot; When Amazon was first developing Alexa, he says, one of the earliest concepts discussed was being able to use voice commands to control Roombas. Given iRobot&#39;s push towards making its device smarter — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">latest Roomba </a>has enough cameras and processing smarts to detect objects, even dog poop — it was only a matter of time until it focused more on voice support.</p><p>While iRobot&#39;s software platform taps into the maps Roombas create around your floorplans, Angle says the company isn&#39;t sharing any data with Amazon. Similarly, he claims iRobot isn&#39;t learning anything from Amazon either. Still, the two companies had to work together to ensure that a complex string of voice commands could work properly with Alexa. And looking ahead, iRobot plans to add even more features, like the ability to set a Do Not Disturb time for cleaning jobs.</p><p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much Roomba customers will actually want to talk with their robots.

According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the beta version of the mobile platform that has just come out has a new feature that will let users scan for AirTags that may be tracking their location. At the moment, users can find the feature under the Items tab in the Find My‌ app — all they need to do is tap the &quot;Items That Can Track Me&quot; option to do a scan.&nbsp;</p><p>Any trackable item nearby that belongs to someone else will be detected and show up as an unknown item. Apple will then point users to a set of instructions on how to disable the device that&#39;s being used to track them. While it could put people&#39;s mind at ease, the new feature could also be a double-edged sword. For users that hide AirTags in bikes, other items thieves could steal and even their pets&#39; collars, this could prevent them from catching the culprit and retrieving their property. The feature might work a lot differently, however, by the time iOS 15.2 is ready for wider rollout.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To note, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-privacy-update-193102233.html">updated</a> AirTags to address stalking concerns back in June. It adjusted the time period after which the device would play a sound when separated from its owner from three days to a random time between 8 and 24 hours. This experimental feature is an additional privacy measure.&nbsp;</p><p>Another interesting feature that showed up with the beta version of iOS 15.2 is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/">Digital Legacy</a>. It will allow users to designate people as Legacy Contacts, who&#39;ll be able to access their account and digital information when they pass away. In the current iteration of the mobile OS, Legacy Contact lives inside Password and Security within the Settings app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5c5e486-921d-4765-bbcd-8e21bd19fcfa</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 11:25:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636542840</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T11:14:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/23e93a00-4210-11ec-b5fc-cd87fa0a6ede" width="1600" height="1039" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/23e93a00-4210-11ec-b5fc-cd87fa0a6ede" width="1600" height="1039" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MacRumors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15.2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15.2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Supreme Court rules in favor of Google in iPhone tracking case]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has escaped the risk of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-30-google-sued-in-the-uk-for-illegal-data-collection.html">lawsuit</a> after violating the privacy of around 5.4 million iPhone users in the UK. The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot allow a US-style Class Action suit to be lobbed at the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, read by Lord Leggatt, was focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws. More importantly, however, was the issue of “damage,” and the fact that the claimants — led by consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd — had not established that any material harm had been caused by Google’s workaround.</p><p>The story begins in 2017 with Lloyd, and many others, formed a group called “Google You Owe Us” to attempt to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012 in violation of UK law. The matter hinged on the fact that Google had deliberately created a workaround to get access to data it was not otherwise entitled to. Lloyd and crew <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-google-safari-workaround-uk-lawsuit-dismissed.html">lost at the High Court</a>, but this initial decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-to-continue.html">overturned by the UK’s Court of Appeal</a>, saying that it was quite proper for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>US-style Class Action lawsuits are not common, or even <em>really a thing</em> in UK law, although it is possible for a large group of litigants to bring a joint action. Lloyd and his cohort were trying to establish that Google’s tracking was, in and of itself, harmful, and by extension a standard level of compensation could be calculated. This was the fact that the Supreme Court rejected most clearly — saying that a set figure (reportedly pegged around £750 (around $1,000) per affected user) was not fair redress.</p><p>David Barker of <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/lloyd-v-google-supreme-court-representative-action">Pinsent Masons</a> — the firm Google hired to fight this case — wrote that the decision upholds the notion that compensation can only be asked for where real harm has been caused. And that, put simply, Google’s aggregation of personal data was insufficient to cause any real-world harm or mental distress. Richard Lloyd, who brought the action, told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mass-legal-action-against-google-blocked-by-supreme-court-12465082"><em>Sky News</em></a> that he was “bitterly disappointed” that the court had “failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other Big Tech firms who break the law.” And that this ruling, in effect, is the writing of a blank check for large technology companies to keep misusing user data without fear of censure. He added that it is time for government leaders to step in and craft laws to better clamp down on the misuse of personal data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76c693ae-0b96-4ba5-9d1c-083eb1d45d8d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 10:44:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636541075</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T10:44:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2019/08/23: The exterior view of the entrance to the global internet search company Google office in London.

The agency is now aiming to land the first woman and next American man on the lunar surface in 2025 at the earliest, NASA administrator Bill Nelson has announced. NASA was originally targeting a 2028 launch date for its return to the Moon, but the Trump administration moved that date up by four years back in 2017. In a conference call with reporters, Nelson said &quot;the Trump administration&#39;s target of 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the unrealistic deadline, Nelson blamed Blue Origin&#39;s lawsuit against the agency for the delay.  It had to put its contract with SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-lunar-lander-on-hold-blue-origin-lawsuit-120527376.html">on hold</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">pause work</a> on the lunar lander that&#39;s meant to take astronauts to the surface of the Moon for a couple of times. NASA lost almost seven months of work on the lander as a result, which had cast doubts on the 2024 landing even before Nelson made his announcement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;ll recall, NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">awarded</a> SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to develop a Starship-based lunar landing system back in April. The agency historically works with more than one contractor for each mission, but in this instance, it inked a deal with Elon Musk&#39;s company alone. Jeff Bezos&#39;s Blue Origin sued NASA over that decision, arguing that it wasn&#39;t given the chance to revise its bid for the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on legal documents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia"><em>The Verge</em></a> obtained in September, however, NASA felt that Blue Origin &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">gambled</a>&quot; with its proposed $5.9 billion lunar lander bid. The company allegedly set the price higher than necessary, because it assumed that NASA would award it a contract but negotiate for a lower price. The Federal Court of Claims ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html">ruled against Blue Origin</a> a few days ago, dismissing its claims that NASA ignored &quot;key flight safety requirements&quot; when it awarded SpaceX the lunar lander contract.</p><p>Nelson&#39;s announcement comes shortly after NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-i-sls-launch-date-163749274.html">moved</a> the uncrewed Artemis I flight test launch from this year to February 2022. That&#39;s assuming everything will go as planned — the Orion capsule and Space Launch System that will be used for the mission will still have to go through a battery of tests before NASA can schedule it for blastoff.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-pushes-back-crewed-moon-landing-to-2025-083617472.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b292e4bc-2717-4aa6-866c-dd77bd1a01bf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 08:36:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636533405</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T08:36:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Court rules that Apple can't push back ordered App Store payment changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/apple-can-t-delay-costly-court-ordered-app-store-change?sref=10lNAhZ9">failed</a> to convince US District c to delay the App Store change she ordered back in September. As the judge for the Apple vs. Epic trial, Rogers ruled in favor of the tech giant for 9 out of 10 counts, but she also decided that Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">must allow</a> developers to direct users to other payment systems within their apps by December 9th. As a response to that, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-files-appeal-app-store-injunction-101556698.html">asked for a stay</a> on the injunction to push back its implementation by one more year. Now, Rogers has rejected the company&#39;s appeal for a stay and called the motion &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot;</p><p>She wrote in the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.830.0_8.pdf">order</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/apple-cant-delay-app-store-payment-changes-judge-says-in-epic-case.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>):</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;...Apple&#39;s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court&#39;s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Apple argued that it needed more time to establish new guidelines to protect users, developers and itself if it allows alternative payment methods. It also previously said that following the court order and allowing developers to link out to other payment methods by December 9th &quot;would be a poor use of resources&quot; due to the &quot;near-inevitable litigation&quot; from Epic regarding the scope of its compliance. In addition, it&#39;s still appealing this aspect of the case, and the Court of Appeals could take more than a year to come to a decision.</p><p>In her ruling, Rogers said that the party that would benefit most from a stay would be Apple, and that the court can &quot;envision numerous avenues&quot; for the tech giant to comply while still protecting its users. &quot;Other than, perhaps, needing time to establish Guidelines, Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,&quot; she added. Despite the court&#39;s decision, Apple hasn&#39;t given up: It will ask San Francisco&#39;s federal appeals court to put Rogers&#39;s order on hold.</p><p>As <em>CNBC</em> has noted, allowing developers to link out to external payment methods doesn&#39;t mean Apple won&#39;t be taking a percentage of their earnings. Google, for instance, recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html">announced</a> that it will now allow the use of alternative payment systems for Play Store apps in South Korea to comply with local laws. While it lowered its commission by four percent for developers using their own payment processors, they will still have to pay the company a cut nonetheless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-alternative-payment-stay-injunction-062133997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2fc428fb-a9ad-445b-84be-87d330792c15</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:21:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636543869</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T11:31:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikada via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Hong Kong, China - October 20, 2011: People in the Apple Store at International Finance Center, Central Hong Kong, opened on the September 24, 2011.

If you’re a film buff, you need no introduction to Weta. It’s the VFX house Peter Jackson co-founded in 1993. It has worked on movies like the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>, <em>Avatar </em>and <em>Black Widow</em>. Under the $1.625 billion deal, Unity is obtaining the company’s technology division, including its artist tools and engineering talent. Weta’s VFX and animation teams will form a separate entity known as WetaFX, which Peter Jackson will continue to hold a majority stake in.

The move will bar ads based on interactions with content related to ethnicity, health, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation, among other hot-button issues.</p><p>It&#39;s a drastic move, and Meta was aware this could hurt some businesses and positive ad uses. However, VP Graham Mudd said the outgoing options could lead to &quot;negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups.&quot; The internet giant believed it could refine its ad platform to serve everyone without hurting business connections.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also giving you more control over the ads you see.

The company says it wants to work with the Oversight Board to “improve the recommendation process,” though it’s not yet clear what those changes might entail. But it suggests Facebook is looking to shake up the way it deals with the independent body it created to oversee its content policies.</p><p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Meta-Q2-and-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update-on-the-Oversight-Board.pdf"><ins>new report </ins></a>detailing Facebook’s dealings with the Oversight Board, the company notes that it’s made significant changes as the result of the Oversight Board’s recommendations. These changes include updates to how it handles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> and nudity, as well as how it determines “newsworthy” content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Facebook is now suggesting it wants to change up the recommendation process. “While we have made these important changes as a result of the board’s recommendations, we believe the current design of the recommendation process may not be the best way to bring about the long-term, structural changes the board is pushing us to undertake,” the company writes in its report. “We are working with the board and our internal teams to explore other ways to potentially improve the recommendation process.”</p><p>Again, it’s not clear exactly what this means for the Oversight Board or Facebook’s relationship with the group. The Oversight Board didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and during a call with reporters on Tuesday, Facebook’s Monika Bickert declined to elaborate on specific changes the company was hoping to make.</p><p>In its report, Facebook writes that “the pace and volume of the recommendations do not allow us adequate time to initially assess and implement the recommendations.” According to Facebook, most of the board’s recommendations “require over a dozen people to assess feasibility, which we cannot easily complete in 30 days.” the company added that it can take considerable time to determine how to integrate the policy suggestions into its existing product development.</p><p>But while it’s not yet clear what will change as a result of Facebook’s proposed “potential changes,” the fact that the company is already trying to make major changes to how it deals with the board is significant. Since its inception, Facebook critics have blasted the Oversight Board as little more than a PR stunt. And while the company has said it will abide by individual content decisions made by the board, its broader policy recommendations are where it could have the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html"><ins>greatest influence</ins></a> over the company. For example, the board criticized Facebook’s decision to impose an “indefinite suspension” on former President Donald Trump, and told the company it needed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>better define</ins></a> its rules for politicians.</p><p>Facebook has even suggested that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-other-companies-202448589.html"><ins>other platforms</ins></a> should use the Oversight Board to monitor their content policies as well. That the company is now claiming it’s too difficult to keep up with the process its executives and policy officials designed could potentially undermine the influence the board is able to wield.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-wants-to-change-the-oversight-boards-recommendation-process-212528909.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f5c3ab0-9ea9-4d65-bcf8-6ddadb7e451f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 21:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636493129</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T21:25:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Oversight Board logo is seen on a smart phone in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

The new numbers, released with the company’s latest quarterly transparency reports, come as Meta faces increasing scrutiny over its ability to protect users and enforce its policies adequately around the world.</p><p>Its latest report marks the first time the company has shared &quot;prevalence&quot; metrics around <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/how-meta-addresses-bullying-harassment/">bullying and harassment</a> on its platform. &quot;Prevalence&quot; is a statistic Facebook uses to track violating content that slips through its detection systems. &quot;It represents the amount of violating content that people actually view that actually shows up on someone&#39;s screen,&quot; the company&#39;s VP of Integrity Guy Rosen told reporters during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the company, the prevalence of bullying content was between 0.14% -0.15% on Facebook and between 0.05%-0.06% on Instagram. “This means bullying and harassment content was seen between 14 and 15 times per every 10,000 views of content on Facebook and between 5 and 6 times per 10,000 views of content on Instagram,” the company explains in a statement. Instagram in particular has faced questions about its ability to deal with bullying and harassment. The company introduced several new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-new-antibullying-features-and-photo-map-040107581.html">anti-bullying</a> measures earlier this year after several UK football players detailed their experience with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-cracks-down-harassment-direct-messages-185441529.html">racist abuse</a> on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the company notes that this “prevalence” metric only accounts for content Facebook and Instagram removes without a user report. That means the statistic is only capturing a subset of all bullying content, since bullying and harassment is not always easy for an automated system to identify.</p><p>That distinction has been underscored by revelations in the Facebook Papers, a trove of documents made public by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. According to documents she shared, Facebook’s own researchers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/">estimate</a> that the company is only able to address around three to five percent of hate speech on its platform, meaning the vast majority goes undetected and is allowed to pollute users’ News Feeds.</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html">pushed back</a> on these claims, and has pointed to the “prevalence” stats it shares in its transparency reports. But as researchers have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/">pointed out</a>, the company’s own accounting of “prevalence” can mask the true amount of violating content on the platform. That’s because Facebook’s automated systems are not always reliable, especially at detecting content in languages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184">other than English</a>. The revelations have fueled allegations that Facebook puts profits ahead of user safety.</p><p>“We have absolutely no incentive, whether it&#39;s commercial or otherwise, to do anything other than make sure people have a positive experience,” Rosen said Tuesday. “I think it&#39;s also just not true that our algorithms are just optimized to squeeze out engagement. We&#39;re constantly refining how we do ranking in order to tackle these problems.”</p><p>In its latest report, Facebook reported that hate speech had declined for the fourth straight quarter, with prevalence declining from 0.05% last quarter to 0.03% this quarter. The company also reported prevalence of hate speech on Instagram for the first time, saying hate speech was at 0.02% or around 2 out of every 10,000 pieces of content viewed on its platform.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that even the most optimistic take on these numbers — 0.03% and 0.02% for Facebook and Instagram, respectively — can still mean millions of people are encountering hate speech every day, given the vast number of users and pieces of content posted to the platforms each day.&nbsp;</p><p>Separately, Facebook also said<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-shift-to-generalized-ai-to-better-identify-violating-content"> its researchers</a> are working on &quot;a relatively new area of AI research called &#39;few-shot&#39; or &#39;zero-shot&#39; learning,&quot; which would enable them to train AI models much more rapidly. Instead of relying on massive datasets to manually train models for, say identifying hate speech, it would enable models that can &quot;learn to recognize something from just a small number of training examples, or even just a single example,&quot; the company wrote. Facebook didn&#39;t say how long it might take to put this research into action, but it suggests the company is still pursuing AI advancements to address major content issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-latest-transparency-report-details-bullying-and-harassment-on-facebook-and-instagram-182854231.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cc2ce7d-f079-4133-b8a4-b711a52cc572</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:28:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486339</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:32:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration logo of Meta is displayed on a mobile phone screen and apps icons on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkey on October 29, 2021.
