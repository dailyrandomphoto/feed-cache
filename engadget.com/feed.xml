The carriers have agreed to comply with a request from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Transportation Department to push back their 5G expansion by two more weeks. Authorities asked the companies for extra time to investigate concerns regarding possible interference with aircraft systems and electronics.&nbsp;</p><p>Both AT&amp;T and Verizon were supposed to to roll out their potentially faster C-band service using newly purchased frequencies back in December, but they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-c-band-5g-due-to-faa-164549890.html">held off</a> on the expansion as requested by the Federal Aviation Administration. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers are worried that the new frequencies are too close to those used by airplanes&#39; radar altimeter, which provides data on the distance between the plane and the ground. Interferences could then lead to unsafe landings. Wireless industry giants <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service?sref=10lNAhZ9">argue</a>, however, that the C-band service&#39;s powers are low enough and that the gap in frequencies is large enough to prevent interference.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shortly before the supposed January 5th rollout, the agencies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-5g-expansion-delay-faa-pete-buttigieg-224552929.html">asked</a> the carriers for a delay of two more weeks to look into the issue. They initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-reject-us-5g-c-band-delay-191634365.html">rejected</a> the authorities&#39; call for an additional delay, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-02/at-t-verizon-reject-u-s-request-for-delay-in-new-5g-service?sref=10lNAhZ9">issuing</a> a joint letter that says honoring the request would be to the &quot;detriment&quot; of customers. The carriers tried to negotiate a compromise instead and told authorities that they&#39;re open to a six-month pause in deployment near some airports.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear what changed the companies&#39; minds, but both have agreed to put a pause on their plans for now.</p><p>A Verizon spokesperson told <em>Engadget</em> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We&#39;ve agreed to a two-week delay which promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January, delivered over America’s best and most reliable wireless network.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>An AT&amp;T spokesperson sent us a similar response:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At Secretary Buttigieg&#39;s request, we have voluntarily agreed to one additional two-week delay of our deployment of C-Band 5G services.  We also remain committed to the six-month protection zone mitigations we outlined in our letter. We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-5g-expansion-061847173.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f1659d-bce1-4ad7-be2a-b26b3ea482fe</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 06:18:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641277189</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T06:19:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/43af8be0-6d1d-11ec-b5f7-b1c0f59997e9" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/43af8be0-6d1d-11ec-b5f7-b1c0f59997e9" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[rbkomar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A commercial airplane flies through storm clouds.

Much <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html"><ins>like last year</ins></a>, the company is touting improved brightness as one of the main reasons to buy its 2022 sets. That&#39;s because this year LG&#39;s more affordable C2 lineup will also include the &quot;evo&quot; panel technology the company debuted in 2021. Additionally, LG claims its new Alpha 9 Gen 5 AI processors will help further increase luminance through a smarter algorithm and better heat dissipation. Those chips will also improve upscaling performance and offer virtual 7.1.2 surround sound up-mixing, according to LG.</p><p>The new OLEDs will ship with the latest version of LG’s webOS operating system. The updated software adds support for individual profiles, allowing you to customize the menu for quick access to your favorite streaming services. By creating a profile, you’ll also get personalized content recommendations and notifications related to your favorite sports teams.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d67d76e0-6ce5-11ec-bcb7-577a52a11609" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="LG G2 Gallery OLED" data-uuid="b777d3de-a545-37c3-b1b2-e60547ae48ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>Another new webOS feature allows you to mirror what you’re watching to a second LG TV. In that way, the company says you watch cable and satellite content on two television sets without an extra set-top box. It’s hard to say how useful that feature will prove since if you have more than one TV in your home, there’s a good chance it’s because your family can’t agree on what to watch in the first place.</p><p>Out of the box, LG’s 2022 TV lineup will support the smart home industry’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html"><ins>Matter</ins></a> standard, allowing you to control devices lights and thermostats from the TVs. LG also promises a better gaming experience thanks to its updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-oled-tv-game-optimizer-google-stadia-135907267.html"><ins>Game Optimizer</ins></a>. The company is adding additional feature and preset toggles to the menu to make it easier to access those when you need them. As before, all G2 and C2 sets will support G-Sync, FreeSync and variable refresh rates. HDMI 2.1 also comes standard across the lineup.</p><p>LG has yet to share pricing, but what we do is that the G2 series will consist of 55-, 65- 75-inch models. The company will also offer two new 83- and 97-inch sets. The more affordable C2 series will consist of six models total, including a new 42-inch size LG says is a great fit for console and PC gaming. The rest of the C2 lineup consists of 48-, 55-, 65-, 77- and 83-inch sets. LG also plans to expand its QNED TV lineup for 2022. Those sets will include the company’s Quantum Dot NanoCell technology and offer 100 percent color volume.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-g2-c2-annoucement-020045964.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db5afdf4-4fd4-45ae-a7f5-3f004b6fbe9f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 02:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641251750</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T23:16:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55fe4300-6ce5-11ec-b7db-ed3c05eaa48a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55fe4300-6ce5-11ec-b7db-ed3c05eaa48a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG C2 42-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG C2 42-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy S21 FE hands-on: Last year’s flagship without the frills]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2022 today, Samsung has finally unveiled the Galaxy S21 FE (or “Fan Edition”) phone. This is basically a tweaked version of <a href="http://engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">last year’s S21</a> that the company is <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s21-5g/buy/galaxy-s21-ultra-5g-128gb-unlocked-sm-g998uzkaxaa/?link=galaxy-s21-ultra-5g/">selling</a> for $700 starting January 11th. That’s $100 less than the regular S21, and for the price this year’s model offers the same 5nm processors, same 120Hz refresh rate (in a slightly bigger screen) and a similar triple camera system. The S21 FE has a larger battery, though, and comes with Android 12. We’ll have a full review coming soon, but based on our brief hands-on with a test unit, the S21 FE appears to be a well-rounded device.</p><p>At first glance, the S21 FE isn’t as eye-catching as last year’s flagship. While it features a similar bump on the top left corner for its camera module, its housing doesn’t have a shiny finish like the original S21. I prefer the previous style — this one’s kind of bland. But the S21 FE feels sturdy and its matte finish helps it resist fingerprints, too</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The S21 FE is also available in a different set of colors than the original: This time, you get to choose from lavender, olive, silver or black (which is the color of my sample unit).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9efbe500-6ced-11ec-bf9d-5248e03722f3" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in black held in mid-air with its right side facing the camera." data-uuid="f8b8a5af-f6c5-3a63-a3f6-a14fd526e3f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>At 177 grams (or 6.2 ounces), the S21 FE is slightly heavier than the S21, which is reasonable given the newer model’s bigger 6.4-inch screen. The display still runs at Full HD+, and looks bright and sharp. But don’t expect S Pen support here like you’d get on the S21+ and Ultra. Like the S21, the Fan Edition doesn’t support Samsung’s stylus.</p><p>Aside from size, the biggest difference between the S21 FE and the original model lie in their rear cameras. While both versions have a similar 12-megapixel main camera with a f/1.8 aperture, the FE’s ultra-wide lens has a slightly wider field of view of 123 degrees. Also, the FE’s telephoto camera uses an 8-megapixel sensor while the S21’s is 64 megapixels, though they both offer 30x Space Zoom.</p><p>During my hands-on period with the S21 FE, I haven’t really put its cameras through rigorous testing and so far I haven’t noticed any major issues with picture quality. Images came out colorful and clear. Oddly, the FE’s front camera is 32 megapixels sharp while the original’s is just 10 megapixels. The selfies I’ve shot with it so far were indeed tack sharp and individual strands of my damaged hair were painfully clear.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f9bf8880-6cf1-11ec-9eef-3a2b6cbfba70" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy S21 FE&#39;s triple camera system on its back.." data-uuid="87a3e5a0-a4f4-39d5-96ab-f77cdbc808fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>These tweaks are similar to how <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s20-fan-edition-5g-700-dollars-price-specs-140005996.html">the S20 FE</a> varied from the S20. Samsung said it sold 10 million units of the S20 FE in just over a year since the phone’s launch in Q4 2020, making that model one of the best-selling Galaxy smartphones over the past year.</p><p>Since this is just a brief hands-on and not our full review, I can&#39;t yet tell how the S21 FE will stack up to other phones in this price range. But already it faces stiff competition from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">the Pixel 6</a>, which offers excellent cameras and software at the same cost, although it has a polarizing design.</p><p>Though the combination of features for the relatively lower price might make the S21 FE an appealing phone to many Samsung fans, the company picked an awkward time to release this device. With next-gen flagships presumably on the horizon, Galaxy shoppers might be inclined to wait and see what the company might bring at that launch. Even if you’re <em>dying</em> to buy a new Galaxy S series handset already though, at least wait till we can test the S21 FE out more comprehensively before spending your money.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-specs-price-availability-hands-on-020006151.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afdc0b0e-3b50-4cf2-9ee3-509f26fe6d31</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 02:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641255969</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T00:26:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3ad4a00-6ceb-11ec-bddf-4611bb3189e0" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3ad4a00-6ceb-11ec-bddf-4611bb3189e0" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in black held in mid-air with its screen facing the camera.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy S21 FE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Withings' Body Scan scale can measure the composition of different parts of your body]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over five years after the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-02-withings-body-cardio-scale-review.html">Body Cardio</a> (and one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-withings-return-tough-wearable-market.html">flirtation</a> with Nokia), French company Withings has released its far most technologically advanced connected scale yet, the Body Scan. The big change over the last model is the addition of a handle with four stainless steel electrodes that allows it to measure ECG, segmented body composition (fat/water in your arms, legs and torso) and even esoteric things like nerve activity. All of these features will also make it one of the most expensive scales yet when it arrives to market.&nbsp;</p><p>Withings says it&#39;s the number one US smart scale manufacturer and created the Body Scan &quot;because users are demanding more and more medical and health data and information,&quot; Withings CEO Mathieu Letombe told Engadget in French.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f7ee360-6c6d-11ec-87d7-9b16c1c5b796" alt="Withings Body Scan scale" data-uuid="9dd382ce-e4cb-31c6-aa7b-bf67d934c2ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>The new scale is certainly designed to deliver that. Though the design and high-strength tempered glass construction are similar to the previous Body Cardio, it&#39;s loaded with extra sensors that can tell you more than ever about your body. That includes four weight sensors, 14 ITO (Indium tin oxide) electrodes within the platform and four stainless steel electrodes on the new handle. The battery can now go for a year between charges compared to nine months before and it packs a larger, higher-resolution 3.2-inch LCD color display.</p><p>The handle allows safe, low-level electrical signals to pass through your entire body, not just your feet — much as you may have seen on some <a href="https://tanita.eu/rd-545-hr/">advanced gym scales</a>.  To start with, that enables a new 6-lead ECG that can detect heart arrhythmias via two sets of electrodes on each side of the handle and one within the base of the sale. That compares to a single lead on smartwatches, so the Body Scan can deliver more specific results &quot;that can easily be ready by a cardiologist,&quot; said Letombe.&nbsp;</p><p>An embedded algorithm can detect heart patterns associated with atrial fibrillation, showing the results on the display or Withings&#39; Health Mate app. Those can be stored to show trends or &quot;shared with medical professionals from the app,&quot; according to Withings. &quot;Each time you weigh yourself, the scale can deliver that information, thanks to the new handle.&quot;&nbsp;</p><section data-eng-breakout="d559f4121dfb464da5d6712175dbeb58" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c86a37e0-6c5f-11ec-8ffa-f89ae9fdc719" alt="Withings Body Scan can also record your ECG and assess nerve activity"></section><p>In terms of your weight, Withings claims the Body Scan is accurate to within 0.1 pounds (50 grams) or double the previous model, but that&#39;s just the start of showing your body makeup. It uses multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure whole-body fat and water percentage, visceral fat, muscle and bone mass and extracellular and intracellular water. It can even provide readings for individual body parts, including your torso, arms and legs. All of that allows you to spot things used by health experts and sports professionals like dangerous localized fat or muscle imbalance, Withings said.&nbsp;</p><p>Working with a French company called Impeto Medical, Withings also developed a feature to assess nerve activity. It can track sweat gland activity in the feet (sudomotor function) using a small direct current via the electrodes located in the plate. Impaired function in that regard could show signs of degeneration of small nerve fibers, something that can be corrected with regular activity and a healthy diet.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a useful function, because there are a lot of chronic health issues like obesity associated with poor nerve function,&quot; Letombe told me. &quot;Impeto creates devices used by neurologists and others doctors that can cost upwards of 10,000 euros, and the Body Scan is a consumer product that, again, does that every time you weigh yourself.&quot; At the same time, Withings will be able to collect nerve activity data from millions of users that could be useful for medical research and patient care.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b3bb3fe0-6c66-11ec-beff-2b499c4f7182" alt="Withings&#39; Body Scan scale has a handle that can measure fat in different parts of your body" data-uuid="56fa5485-428c-3da1-969b-76572f52c5c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Along with the scale, Withings is also introducing (yep) a subscription service, with the price yet to be announced. It will &quot;allow users to connect with medical specialists for advice and consultation while providing clinical teams with data in real-time,&quot; Withings said. It&#39;ll also offer personalized health plans, videos and more covering topics like nutrition, sleep, exercise and stress management to help users with their health goals.&nbsp;</p><p>With the Body Scan, Withings will be offering consumers one of the more advanced health, sports and medical home devices out there — at a price. It&#39;s expected to cost $300 when it arrives to the US and Europe in the second half of 2022 following FDA clearance, or $100 more than the Body Scan&#39;s launch price.

This year, the major talking point is likely to be the new Nighthawk RAXE300, which sits a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nighthawk-raxe500-170003612.html">little below the flagship RAXE500</a> in the company’s high-end line. The RAXE300 offers a combined top WiFi speed of 7.8Gbps, plus the benefit of being able to leverage the 6GHz band for faster connectivity. Netgear promises that you’ll get around 2,500 square feet of coverage from the device, plus enough gigabit ethernet ports to connect the rest of your smart home to.</p><p>At the same time, Netgear wanted to take the opportunity to remind the world of the <a href="https://www.netgear.com/home/wifi/mesh/nbk752/">Orbi 5G WiFi 6 Mesh NBK752</a>, which was released late last year. It’s the first 5G tri-band mesh system, which can leverage the 5G modem inside for always-on mobile broadband or as a backup should a standard wired connection fail. Not to mention that, as like many of Netgear’s tri-band products, the backhaul network between the router and its satellite(s) should ensure a stronger, more reliable connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rounding out the list is the Orbi Pro, SXK50, the company’s new mid-range device for small businesses and professional types working from home. It’s a little behind the top-tier SK80, with a cap of 75 concurrent devices, down from 100 for the flagship, as well as a slightly slower WiFi 6 speed, but it’s likely to be an ideal option for some businesses looking for faster and more reliable connectivity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5ea6a530-6cb6-11ec-8e7f-92114fa2c34c" style="height:844;width:1501;" alt="Promotional image for Netgear&#39;s new Game Booster add-on" data-uuid="6d8a8fba-dee2-30e8-9ef0-817d2bb54592"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netgear</div></figure><p>Rounding out the announcements for this year is Game Booster, a paid-for add-on service for Orbi users so that they cam get the same <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nitehawk-pro-gaming-xr1000-123031339.html">lag-banishing features found in the Nighthawk routers</a>. That includes the ability to track pings and pick the fastest server for specific online games, as well as a built-in ad-and-tracking blocker. Unfortunately, such features will set you back $50 per year after a 30-day free trial, and only if you currently own the Orbi series 750, 850 and 960.</p><p>The Netgear Nighthawk RAXE300 will be available in the first quarter of 2022, and will set you back $400, while the Orbi 5G is already available, priced at $1,099.99. The Orbi Pro SXK50, meanwhile, will be available in the US at some point in January 2022, and can be pre-ordered now for $450.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netgear-nighthawk-300-ces-2022-010041387.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6a397519-7d7e-423d-8717-0402d35acd3e</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 01:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238219</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:33:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4d117480-6cb6-11ec-afdb-793409bb74da" width="1498" height="844" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4d117480-6cb6-11ec-afdb-793409bb74da" width="1498" height="844" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netgear]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netgear Router]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netgear Router]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Y-Brush shows off a concept for its second-generation, uh, Y-shaped toothbrush]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been the better part of two years since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-ybrush-10-second-electric-toothbrush-final.html">Y-Brush started shipping</a>, offering people a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1283858434/y-brush-the-10-second-deep-cleaning-toothbrush/">different way</a> to clean their teeth. The retainer-shaped device is filled with nylon bristles which you put into your mouth, promising to sanitize your chompers in just 10 seconds. Now, at CES 2022, the company is showing off the concept for its second-generation device that’ll offer a lot more than its predecessor ever did.</p><p>The new Y-Brush concept has bristles on both sides of the retainer, meaning that users don’t need to pull the device out and flip it over to do the bottom half of their mouths. Instead, you’ll just need to move it to the sides a bit to ensure perfect coverage. More importantly, however, is that rather than just one program, this proposed new model will offer six vibration modes, including Gum Care, Whitening and Polishing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A beefier base both enables inductive charging and helps reduce toppling while sat on the countertop, while a companion app will help you set different programs based on your brushing habits. Although given that the whole point of this thing is to shove in your mouth and not do much at all, we’re not sure how useful that would be.</p><p>For now, this second-generation Y-Brush is little more than a concept that the company wants to show off here at CES. But the thought is that this initial idea can be refined ready for the second-generation Brush, whenever that turns up.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/y-brush-2-concept-010037878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a78bacec-1ec2-4f1e-8b0f-bce28435b74f</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 01:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221999</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:00:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/bee926f0-6ca4-11ec-beda-47c90ad40b26" width="1920" height="1344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/bee926f0-6ca4-11ec-beda-47c90ad40b26" width="1920" height="1344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Y-Brush]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Concept design for the second-generation Y-Brush]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Y-Brush 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus 10 Pro is the first new phone of 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First out of the gates in 2022, OnePlus has a new flagship for anyone <em>already</em> looking for a smartphone refresh.

Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing startup. The verdict comes after a months-long trial, and more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-15-elizabeth-holmes-steps-down-ceo-theranos.html"><ins>three years</ins></a> after she was first charged and forced to step down as CEO in 2018.</p><p>Of the 11 total charges, Holmes was found guilty on four: conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud against individual investors. She was found not guilty on four additional charges, including one count of conspiracy to defraud patients, two counts of fraud against investors, and one count of wire fraud stemming from ads Theranos ran in Arizona. The jury was <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/elizabeth-holmes-jury-deadlocked-3-charges-judge-sends-back-deliberate-rcna10770">deadlocked</a> on three other counts of wire fraud and returned no verdict on those charges.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>During the trial, Holmes’ lawyers tried to portray her as a young and inexperienced entrepreneur. “Elizabeth Holmes worked herself to the bone for 15 years trying to make lab testing more affordable,” one of Holmes’ attorneys said in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-holmes-case-opening-arguments-121138767.html"><ins>opening arguments</ins></a>. “She failed … but failure is not a crime.”</p><p>Holmes, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html"><ins>testified</ins></a> during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” As <em>The New York Times </em>pointed out, she “spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company’s shortcomings.”</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Holmes knew about serious flaws in the company’s technology and hid the issues from investors. Former patients who had received inaccurate blood tests also testified, including an Arizona woman who received an incorrect result for an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/theranos-patient-says-blood-test-came-back-with-false-positive-for-hiv.html"><ins>HIV test</ins></a>, and a woman who was misdiagnosed with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html"><ins>a miscarriage</ins></a>.</p><p>Holmes’ story has been a source of widespread fascination even for those outside of Silicon Valley. At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, and had a board of directors filled with former high-ranking <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-former-board-members-henry-kissinger-george-shultz-james-mattis-2019-3"><ins>government officials</ins></a>, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Holmes, who had dropped out of Stanford to start the company, regularly appeared on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/11620036/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmess-five-best-cover-story-appearances"><ins>magazine covers</ins></a> and was often compared to Steve Jobs and other iconic founders. (Holmes herself was reportedly infatuated with Jobs and adopted his signature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/fashion/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-theranos.html"><ins>black turtlenecks</ins></a>.)</p><p>Former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter John Carreyrou was the first to report on issues with Theranos’ technology in 2015, and his coverage prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits that ultimately resulted in criminal charges for Holmes and former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. On the stand, Holmes testified that her romantic relationship with Balwani had been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani.html"><ins>abusive</ins></a>. Balwani’s trial is scheduled to begin <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-14/balwani-s-theranos-fraud-trial-delayed-as-holmes-fight-drags-on"><ins>in February</ins></a>.</p><p>There has been no shortage of pop culture depictions of Holmes. After Carreyrou’s best seller, <em>Bad Blood</em>, there was an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-09-the-inventor-hbo-theranos.html"><ins>HBO documentary</ins></a> and several podcasts about Theranos’ rise and ultimate downfall.

Following the verdict, the judge in the case said Holmes would be allowed to remain free on bail for the time being, though a new hearing &quot;to discuss any change in the conditions of Holmes&#39; liberty&quot; could come as soon as next week, according to <em>Mercury News</em> reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/ethanbaron/status/1478172178352771076">Ethan Baron</a>. Prosecutors also asked for Holmes bail conditions to be changed, which would require her &quot;to put up cash or property, rather than just her signature, to cover her $500,000 bail.&quot;</p><p>The judge also declared a mistrial on the three wire fraud charges that had left the jury deadlocked. The mistrial leaves open the possibility of a new trial, though the prosecutors haven&#39;t said whether they would pursue such an action.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-verdict-guilty-fraud-001725594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66c4f3e6-b097-45cb-8eaf-d81405c6c03e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:17:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641259554</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T01:25:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Holmes, founder and former CEO of Theranos, arrives for motion hearing on Monday, November 4, 2019, at the U.S. District Court House inside Robert F.

The Cypress Hero Backpack has a built-in location tracker that could help its rightful owner find it through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">Find My network</a> if it goes missing. Conversely, if you misplace your iPhone, you can press a button on the backpack to ping your phone, as long as you&#39;ve set things up in the Targus app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/targus/">Targus</a> says the tracker is &quot;highly integrated&quot; into the backpack, which should offer some additional anti-theft protection. You can set up geofencing alerts, so if the backpack moves out of a certain area, you&#39;ll receive an alert. The tracker also has a built-in sound alert (which will likely be around as loud as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a>) that you can trigger remotely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracker has a replaceable battery that you can top up via USB, though Targus says it will run for around a year before you need to recharge it. Targus crafted the backpack with sustainability in mind, as it&#39;s made with 26 recycled water bottles. The Cypress Hero Backpack, which has an IPX3 water resistance rating, should be available sometime in the spring or summer. It costs $150.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f595fb0-6810-11ec-afcf-ca235cdcce81" alt="Targus DOCK720 docking station." data-uuid="d3ffb672-3fd8-3073-9817-1868767b1aef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Targus</div></figure><p>On top of that, Targus announced the DOCK720, a docking station that supports a single 8K monitor or up to four 4K monitors. The company says it&#39;s the &quot;first biometric device and docking solution in one&quot; — in other words, it has a fingerprint reader. You can expect an array of ports too, including USB-A, USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI and a combo audio jack. The dock will be available this month for $443.</p><p>The Targus Docking Display, meanwhile, is a 24-inch 1080p LCD monitor with a built-in 2MP webcam, microphone, speakers and USB-C docking station. You can daisy chain it to a second monitor and power both displays from your computer. The Docking Display will ship in February. The primary monitor costs $400 and the secondary monitor (which doesn&#39;t have a webcam) is $180.</p><p>In addition, Targus is expanding its lineup of antimicrobial products, which now includes backpacks, shoulder bags and protective sleeves for laptops. The company claims its DefenseGuard Antimicrobial Protection effectively prevents the growth of 99.9% of germ-causing microorganisms.</p><p>It will also release the UV-C LED Disinfection Light next month after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html">debuting it at CES 2021</a>. For five minutes every hour, the $300 device will bathe a surface (or, more likely, a keyboard and mouse) in ultraviolet light to effectively kill 99 percent of pathogens.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/targus-smart-backpack-apple-find-my-tracker-docking-station-monitor-disinfection-light-230012642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8b9f0f-4bca-420b-bcc1-3c3d78445d19</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 23:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221478</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Targus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Targus Cypress Hero Backpack with a built-in location tracker.

One of the limitations of those devices is that they typically only include one monitoring function. In the long run, that’s something that can cost you extra money if you move and end up with too many of one sensor and not enough of another. Security camera maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arlo" href="https://fave.co/3EPKaj4">Arlo</a> may have an elegant solution for that problem.</p><p>At CES 2022, the company introduced a security system that includes an all-in-one multi-sensor with eight monitoring functions. It can detect motion (including door and window openings), water leaks, light and temperature changes, as well as sounds made by T3 and T4 smoke alarms. Each sensor is about an inch wide and connects to a modular hub that includes a backlit keypad and NFC connectivity so that you can use your phone to activate and disarm the system. The hub is also compatible with Arlo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">various security cameras</a> and its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Secure subscription service" href="https://fave.co/3CQaola">Secure subscription service</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Arlo Security System will go on sale sometime in the first half of 2022, according to a statement the company shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"><em>The Verge</em></a>. It promised to disclose more information, including details on pricing, closer to release. The company didn’t have anything to say about the Security System’s smart home integrations today, but it did announce that it will support the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html">Matter</a> standard moving forward. At its simplest, the promise of Matter is that you’ll be able to buy a device and use it with the voice assistant of your choice and easily connect it to your existing home network.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arlo-security-system-ces-2022-201256180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc40b1e2-cfef-4d5b-bb79-25f9f1f97a8c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 20:12:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641241442</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T20:24:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/762f1570-6ccf-11ec-bff6-69cbcbce8cd3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/762f1570-6ccf-11ec-bff6-69cbcbce8cd3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arlo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arlo Security System]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arlo Security System]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EVs made up 65 percent of car sales in Norway last year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electric vehicles accounted for nearly two-thirds of all new car sales in Norway this past year, according to newly published data from the country’s <a href="https://ofv.no/aktuelt/2022/2021-ble-tidens-rekord%C3%A5r-for-nybilregistreringer"><ins>Road Federation</ins></a>. In 2021, Norwegian dealerships sold 176,276 cars, 65 percent of which were EVs. That’s an 11 percentage point increase from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-traditional-engines-in-norway-for-all-of-2020-115746618.html">year prior</a> when they accounted for 54 percent of all new car sales.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tesla Model 3 was the most popular choice among new buyers followed by Toyota’s hybrid RAV4, the only car with an internal combustion engine to make the country’s top-ten best-selling list. Other notable cars to make the list include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html"><ins>Volkswagen ID.4</ins></a> in third place and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html"><ins>Polestar 2</ins></a> in the number 10 spot.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Norwegian EV Association told <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/electric-cars-take-two-thirds-norway-car-market-led-by-tesla-2022-01-03/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> electric vehicle sales could make up as much as 80 percent of the country’s total car market by 2022 — as long as chip shortages don’t cause further shipping delays. As in 2020, much of what’s driving EV adoption in Norway is the country’s generous subsidies. Car buyers don’t have to pay taxes imposed on traditional internal combustion engine vehicles when they buy an EV. In 2021, the country’s federal government missed out on approximately $3.41 billion in tax revenue to push forward on its plan to end all gasoline-powered car sales by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-gas-cars-norway-2021-185544342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4a1c81a-151f-4b64-93d5-7523b1fa1fe6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 18:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238950</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:42:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz boasts 620-mile range for its latest EV concept]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="851681933b794e2c93d36a9c065d33ce"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEVZWNbn7ys?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Mercedes-Benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> has <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-211879a94f6a1a0ff764674cdc0a8630-vision-eqxx-taking-electric-range-and-efficiency-to-an-entirely-new-level">unveiled</a> a concept electric vehicle it claims would be able to run for more than 620 miles before needing to recharge.

The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What&#39;s more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.</p><p>Teams from Mercedes&#39; research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept. They harnessed digital tools to reduce waste and weight by cutting out excess material — the wheels are made with magnesium and the brake discs are built with aluminum alloy. The Vision EQXX uses recycled and plant-based materials too.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the interior, the Vision EQXX&#39;s infotainment system has a single 47.5-inch, mini-LED 8K screen. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a> in the EQS, it spans almost the entire width of the cabin, though this is a one-piece display.

Recordings are stored on iCloud and you can view them for up to 10 days via the Home app on iPhone, iPad and Mac. There&#39;s end-to-end encryption, so only the owner can see live video and recordings.</p><p>The camera can record 1080p video at 24 frames per second. It has a 157-degree field of view and two-way voice communication. The Outdoor Cam can detect motion up to 30 feet away through infrared night vision.</p><p>It&#39;s not the only outdoor camera that works with HomeKit Secure Video. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-13-the-best-outdoor-security-camera.html">Netatmo Outdoor Camera</a> does so as well. Still, it&#39;s interesting to see a smart security camera that requires Apple devices to operate.</p><p>You can pick up the Eve Outdoor Cam on April 5th from Eve and Amazon. Apple will sell the $250 camera at a later date.</p><p>In addition, Eve <a href="https://www.evehome.com/en/news/eve-and-coulisse-eve-motionblinds-availability"><ins>announced</ins></a> that its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/matter/"><ins>Matter-ready</ins></a> motors for blinds and shades are now available from a <a href="https://motionblinds.com/stores?appleHomeKit=true"><ins>number of retailers</ins></a>.

The most intriguing of them is a new version of the Chromebook Spin 513 (pictured above), one of Acer&#39;s mid-range options. While the company already sells a few different configurations of the Spin 513, this new model has a somewhat unusual processor on board. It&#39;s using MediaTek&#39;s eight-core Kompanio 1380 processor, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. In the past, I&#39;ve been reluctant to recommend Chromebooks without Intel processors, but I won&#39;t write this one off without testing it first.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming the processor holds up, there are some other things to like about the Chromebook Spin 513. This year&#39;s model has a 13.5-inch touchscreen with a 2,256 x 1,504 resolution; that&#39;s a 3:2 aspect ratio like the Chromebook Spin 713 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">I reviewed last year</a>. The Spin 713 is an expensive Chromebook at $699, but the Spin 513 is priced at $599. That&#39;s not cheap, but I&#39;m glad to see Acer put this 3:2 display on a less expensive option. As the name suggests, the Flip 513 has a 360-degree hinge so the laptop can be flipped around into tablet mode as well as &quot;tent&quot; mode for watching video. Unfortunately, we&#39;ll have to wait until June for this laptop to go on sale.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other two new Acer Chromebooks are budget options, both priced at $299. The 2022 Chromebook 315 is a 15.6-inch laptop, and its large 1080p panel (touchscreen optional) is the main selling point here. Other specs are pretty standard for this price range: Intel Celeron or Pentium Silver processors, up to 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage and about 10 hours of battery life. The Chromebook 314, on the other hand, is essentially the same as the 315, it just has a smaller, 14-inch 1080p screen. The Chromebook 315 will be on sale this month in the US, but the 314 won&#39;t be available until June.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-513-2022-price-specs-170038270.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cb4a04a-91ad-4dd4-995e-2035b2bc5aad</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238438</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:34:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kohler's fog-emitting smart 'Stillness Bath' is yours for $8,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/kohler/"><ins>Kohler</ins></a> has revealed when you&#39;ll be able to snag the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-of-ces-2021-winners-215307033.html"><ins>Stillness Bath</ins></a> it unveiled at CES 2021, as well as a number of other smart home products.

The system allows you to fill your bath to a specified depth and temperature through a voice command, control panel or the Konnect app. You can have up to 10 presets, and you&#39;ll be able to drain the bath using a voice command too. The system — which pairs with a Kohler digital valve, shout and compatible bath — will be available to buy in May, and it starts at $2,700.</p><p>Later this month, Kohler will start shipping home water monitors that it developed with the help of Phyn. The H2Wise systems can monitor water use on every home fixture. Along with alerting homeowners immediately when they detect a leak, the systems will offer detailed insights about home water use. They also use pressure sensing to look for crystals forming in pipes, so they can alert users before pipes freeze and burst.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4002acc0-6caa-11ec-8fff-4a9437db4297" style="height:2004;width:3000;" alt="Kohler H2Wise water monitoring system connected to pipes" data-uuid="47464976-4d3e-3f64-81fe-172e74a794c6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>The DIY version (H2Wise) can be installed under a single sink, while the pro model, H2Wise+, is attached to the home&#39;s main valve and can shut off water throughout the residence if it detects a leak. As well as the Kohler app, you can connect the units to voice assistants. The DIY model costs approximately $400, and Kohler says the pro version (which can also be used outdoors) will be an estimated $666.70.</p><p>Among the other products Kohler will release this year is the Power Reserve Energy Storage System, which can pair with solar panel systems to store energy they produce. The battery can act as a backup for outages or to power the home using stored solar energy and reduce dependence on utility power. You can also prioritize the use of stored energy during peak usage times to lower the cost of your utility bills.</p><p>There could be a benefit for homes that don&#39;t have solar panels, as the system can store energy from the power grid at times of lower electricity usage. Kohler Power Reserve will start at around $13,325 for a system with a 10 kWh battery capacity, though you can have up to 20 kWh.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kohler-stillness-bath-pricing-availability-hands-free-faucet-home-energy-storage-155808475.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44bdb3fd-508c-4857-a056-b5a56b6ee821</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:58:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238381</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:33:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kohler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kohler's Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kohler Stillness Bath]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag is the cheapest it's ever been at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s AirTags can be a good way to keep track of that new backpack or wallet you were gifted during the holidays, and now you can grab one of the trackers for less. Amazon has a single <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirTag" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ">AirTag</a> for $24, which is $5 less than usual and a new record-low. The only time we&#39;ve seen AirTags for less than this was during a Woot sale on a four-pack. This, however, is the best price we&#39;ve seen if you want just one of the trackers — and while it&#39;s a relatively small discount, it&#39;s a good deal on an accessory that rarely goes on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ" id="e0c890e637b1452882acc1322a6ad312" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirTag at Amazon - $24</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are designed to work with iPhones, which means you&#39;ll get a pretty seamless experience from the moment you take the coin-sized tracker out of the box. The Find My app will immediately recognize the AirTag and you can label it with the name of whatever it&#39;s attached to. Since there&#39;s no keyhole on the AirTag, you will need some sort of case or holder if you want to secure the tracker to your keys, but you can find <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">affordable AirTag accessories</a> easily across the web. Given how small AirTags are, they&#39;ll easily slip into a pocket of your bag or a fold in your wallet without trouble.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once set up, you can return to the Find My app to locate your missing things and you can force the AirTag to emit a chime so you can more easily find your stuff if you&#39;re still relatively close to it. Plus, if you have an iPhone that supports ultra-wideband, the AirTag&#39;s Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your stuff with directions on your handset&#39;s screen. You may have to wait a bit to get the AirTag as Amazon&#39;s estimated delivery time is at the end of January, but now&#39;s a good opportunity to add an AirTag to your Apple setup and save a bit of money while doing so.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c56f72ad-cab7-435d-95a5-21e94204094d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:38:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641224301</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's workout-ready Elite 4 Active earbuds are now available for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">Jabra debuted</a> its ultra affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Elite 3</a> earbuds. That model offers all of the core features you&#39;d expect from a set of true wireless earbuds with good sound quality, solid battery life and a comfy fit. And all of that only costs you $80. There were some omissions — most notably the lack of active noise cancellation (ANC) — but the company is officially debuting a new option at CES that checks even more boxes while keeping the price low: <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">the Elite 4 Active</a>.</p><p>While these earbuds <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">made an early appearance</a> in the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-wireless-earbuds-142911217.html">last week</a>, Jabra <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jabra-boosts-new-years-fitness-resolutions-with-new-jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-301452531.html">has now officially announced</a> the new set for the US. The Elite 4 Active features a similar design to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">the range of new earbuds</a> the company began announcing last year. This means the buds should be comfy due to their smaller size and recently redesigned shape. As the name implies, the Elite 4 Active is built to withstand sweaty workouts with an IP57 waterproof rating.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4c75d991-0fbc-4640-923b-11d3954bc63d"/><p>In terms of audio, the Elite 4 Active houses 6mm drivers and you can tweak the EQ via Jabra&#39;s app. This new model also features ANC, which the more affordable Elite 3 does not. The only caveat is that it&#39;s not adjustable like the noise cancellation on the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a> earbuds. Jabra&#39;s transparency mode, HearThrough, is available on the Elite 4 Active to allow you to hear your surroundings when needed. Four mesh covered microphones assist with calls and Jabra says their design will reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Elite 3, you can expect up to seven hours of battery life with an additional three charges in the case. Jabra has also included features like the ability to use either earbud solo, Google Fast Pair, Alexa built-in and Spotify Tap playback. The best part? They&#39;re available starting today for $120 from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3sPX79Z">Amazon</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra" href="https://fave.co/3FTL6UE">Jabra</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-price-specs-152938907.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1ef55f1-ebe1-4a71-9f46-01e7d2f34dc6</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:29:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641223953</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:32:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76c51b11-6ca7-11ec-bfd7-7fd5cfa3efe6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76c51b11-6ca7-11ec-bfd7-7fd5cfa3efe6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's second-gen Nest Hub drops to $60 in New Year's sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of Google&#39;s Nest devices went on sale for the holiday shopping season and, while those deep discounts have come and gone, we&#39;re already seeing new sales pop up across the web.

It has a minimalist design, a lovely 7-inch display, clearer and louder audio than its predecessor and faster performance as well. It&#39;s just the right size to fit into any room without taking up too much space, and you can even place it on your nightstand and it will track your sleep. The feature was a bit finicky when we tested it, but as long as it&#39;s place precisely, you should get data on your sleep duration, quality, schedule and even snoring information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nest Audio is Google&#39;s $100 smart speaker that competes with Amazon&#39;s Echo and Apple&#39;s HomePod mini. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">holds its own</a> against both of those devices and it earned a score of 87 from us for its solid audio quality, charming design, good Google Assistant performance and stereo mode when two of the speakers are paired. It&#39;s the smart speaker to get if you care at all about audio quality and already rely on the Google Assistant a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Mini</a> may seem like an attractive option at $25, but you get what you pay for. Like its Amazon counterpart, the Echo Dot, the Nest Mini is an affordable way to get the Google Assistant into a small place but you&#39;ll sacrifice quite a bit on sound quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> is for those who want to go all in on both sound and Google smart devices. It has the best audio quality of them all plus a 10-inch display, gesture controls and the ability to double as a Nest Cam. It would make a good home-base smart display, one that sits in your living room or kitchen so everyone in your family has access to it when necessary.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-drops-to-60-in-new-years-sale-144818377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa6e7d7c-f270-4d20-bae9-a70f478d7b72</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 14:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221303</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:48:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub 2021 (2nd gen) photo.

The game forces you to do things like squat, jog in place and more to move your character through a fantasy world, making it a more interesting way to work out at home, especially during the winter months. Amazon has the pack for $55, or $25 off its usual price, and it&#39;s currently in stock as of writing this, so you can get your hands on it fairly quickly. The price only appears on the product page if you&#39;re a Prime subscriber, but it&#39;s available for all and it will show up once you have the game in your cart.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31jevsm" id="af4d3c5a87d7429bb047e10a2d3d0dc8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ring Fit Adventure at Amazon - $55</a><p>Designed to work with the Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-ring-fit-adventure-winter-workout.html"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a> tracks motion using the console&#39;s Joy-Cons. One straps to the provided ring while the other attaches to a leg strap so it can keep track of both upper- and lower-body movements. Like regular games that don&#39;t have a sneaky exercise component, you&#39;ll design your character when you first boot up the title and they&#39;ll immediately be plopped into a new world that&#39;s ready to be explored. Only here, you&#39;ll do so by running in place and completing exercises like leg lifts and crunches to defeat enemies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Ring Fit Adventure</em> won&#39;t replicate a treadmill run or even a strength-training workout video you can follow along, but that&#39;s ultimately the point of an exercise-based game like this. It&#39;s designed to provide a unique workout that doesn&#39;t feel like a regular fitness routine. We also appreciate that the game targets all part of the body with the moves it asks you to do, and you can customize it a bit by choosing the exercises you want to run through. There&#39;s also a handy &quot;quiet mode&quot; that removes actions like jumping up and down and instead focuses on lower-impact moves.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendos-ring-fit-adventure-is-back-on-sale-for-55-135758105.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">611479af-ca2c-4793-aa1f-45c90a318a21</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 13:57:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641218283</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T13:58:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/65bdb460-e186-11ea-bfbd-ca008edf6c1c" width="640" height="433" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tech that helps with those New Year’s resolutions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the new year.

The <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3161717/china-gaming-crackdown-freeze-new-video-game-licences-extends-2022"><em>SCMP</em></a> says that the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) has not issued a new license to a game developer since July 2021. And that, as a consequence, a number of local firms have been forced to exit the business, while some of the larger players are looking to move operations overseas. It’s not clear if the NPPA’s inaction is the direct cause of these closures, especially given the broader debt crisis in China, but there’s a belief that something is up.</p><p>The NPPA has reportedly been tight-lipped about why it’s suddenly decided to stop issuing licenses, but you can likely guess why. China spent much of 2021 amplifying its already fierce criticism of video games, with a key state-owned news outlet describing them as “spiritual opium” in the summer. At the end of August 2021, limits on how long minors could play some titles was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html">slashed to just three hours a week</a>.

As part of her <a href="https://www.regeringen.dk/nyheder/2022/statsminister-mette-frederiksens-nytaarstale/">New Year’s Address</a>, she said that (translated) “by 2025, Danes must have the opportunity to fly green on a domestic route.” She added that “by 2030 at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” It was part of a broader commitment by the leader to toughen measures against polluters and to jump-start the country’s green transition.</p><p>There are, however, reasons to be concerned that such an ambitious deadline can be reached, given the lack of ready alternatives. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">Electric planes may never succeed</a>, and hydrogen flying, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">while much more promising</a>, is nowhere near ready to be rolled out to a major airline’s fleet. Not to mention, of course, that only hydrogen produced as a result of electrolysis, powered by excess renewable energy, can be called truly “green.” <a href="https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article12437427.ece"><em>EnergiWatch</em></a> has said that Denmark’s standing policy of waiting for magic bullet technologies to come to fruition is not going to help it reach its international commitments on climate emissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Denmark has made more steps than some countries to help make the transition toward zero-carbon technologies. The country has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-to-end-offshore-oil-gas-pumping-by-2050-162837374.html">issued a hard deadline</a> to end oil and gas exploration and is a big player in the wind power industry. At the start of 2021, it committed to build an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-energy-island-north-sea-wind-power-140022879.html">artificial island</a> which could collect and store power from Denmark’s wind farms, enough to supply 10GW. At the same time, the country hopes that any excess wind power can be used to drive an electrolyzer, helping it develop a nice sideline as a producer of guilt-free Hydrogen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/denmark-pledges-green-domestic-flights-by-2030-101536240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2001297e-d119-458d-92eb-567c9196dd9d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641202848</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T09:40:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbus A320 SAS Airlines.
