While that feature didn’t quite make the release of those two updates, it’s now available at six Hyatt locations across the US. As you might expect, it allows you to store a digital version of your hotel keycard in Apple Wallet.</p><p>You can add the keycard at any point after you reserve a room. However, you’ll still need to check in at the front desk before you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to enter your guestroom or any other restricted area within the hotel. The digital keycards support Apple Wallet’s Express Mode feature, which means you don’t need to authenticate your identity with Face ID or Touch ID every time you want to use the feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If at any point you decide to extend your stay or change rooms, the hotel can update your keycard without the need for you to visit the front desk. What’s more, if your device starts running low on battery life and enters Power Reserve mode, you can still use your iPhone or Apple Watch as a keycard for up to five hours.</p><p>The six locations where you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to store a keycard are as follows: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p><p>Hyatt says it expects to roll out the technology to all of its locations globally. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-digital-id-delay-195046762.html"><ins>Sometime next year</ins></a>, Apple also plans to allow iOS 15 and watchOS 8 to store government issued IDs from select states as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-hotel-keycards-hyatt-launch-190013202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cf0798a-0b23-4144-aec8-c82207f5eeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638989843</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T18:57:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyatt Hotels Corporation]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ford Bronco Sport contains trace amounts of recycled ocean plastic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many car brands are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">touting recycled parts</a> in their vehicles, but Ford thinks it can claim some extra bragging rights.

At the same time, it shows just how far Ford has to go.

This might help you catch shops lying about the quality of their parts, though, and could be useful if you repair an iPhone yourself and want to be sure your fixes went smoothly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df0c8187-af16-4774-ae0b-b8cb86e61af3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638985550</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:46:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GTA Online's next big update features Dr. Dre and Franklin from 'GTA V']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rockstar%20games/">Rockstar Games</a> will soon release another big update for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gta%20online/"><em><ins>GTA Online</ins></em></a>, which includes a story mission featuring one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/GTA%20V/"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto V</ins></em><ins>&#39;s</ins></a> main characters. &quot;The Contract&quot; centers around Franklin Clinton and his friends, who aspire to be problem solvers for celebrities and &quot;rich folk who got rich folk problems.&quot;</p><p>One of those potential clients is Dr. Dre, who appears as himself in the story.

The tool essentially simulates what a conversation like that may look like with the help of AI chatbots. At launch, the CCS came with access to one such “persona.” Today, The Trevor Project is <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/the-trevor-project-expands-its-ai-innovation-with-new-crisis-contact-simulator-persona-to-scale-counselor-training/">adding a second one called Drew</a>. The new chatbot represents a fictional youth in their early 20s who lives in California and faces bullying and harassment.</p><p>Since implementing its first persona, the aptly named Trevor, in February, the organization says the technology has helped train more than 1,000 counselors. One thing to note here is The Trevor Project is using the Crisis Contact Simulator to complement its existing training methods; the tool is not a replacement for in-person training. It allows new applicants to complete two roleplay sessions at a time that works best for them. It also claims the chatbots offer an accurate representation of today’s Gen Z youth, complete with “realistic” capitalization and punctuation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Starting from the first conception of the Crisis Contact Simulator two years ago, it has always been our hope to develop a variety of training roleplay personas that represent the diverse experiences and intersectional identities of the LGBTQ young people we serve, each with their own stories and feelings,” said Dan Fichter, The Trevor Project’s head of AI and engineering. “We’re excited to deploy Drew with our trainees to offer a wider variety of practice scenarios and narratives, which will better prepare them to connect with any young person in a moment of crisis when the time comes.”</p><p>The Trevor Project is no stranger to the tech world.

Machine learning systems can help alleviate some of this burden by automating the policy enforcement process, however modern AI systems often require months of lead time to properly train and deploy (time mostly spent collecting and annotating the thousands, if not millions of, necessary examples). To shorten that response time, at least to a matter of weeks rather than months, Meta’s AI research group (formerly FAIR) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14690.pdf">has developed a more generalized technology</a> that requires just a handful of specific examples in order to respond to new and emerging forms of malicious content, called Few-Shot Learner (FSL).</p><p>Few-shot learning is a relatively recent development in AI, essentially teaching the system to make accurate predictions based on a limited number of training examples — quite the opposite of conventional supervised learning methods. For example, if you wanted to train a standard SL model to recognize pictures of rabbits, you feed it a couple hundred thousand rabbit pictures and then you can present it with two images and ask if they both show the same animal. Thing is, the model doesn’t know if the two pictures are of rabbits because it doesn’t actually know what a rabbit is. That’s because the model’s purpose isn’t to spot rabbits, the model’s purpose is to look for similarities and differences between the presented images and predict whether or not the things displayed are the same. There is no larger context for the model to work within, which makes it only good for telling “rabbits” apart — it can’t tell you if it’s looking at an image of a rabbit, or of a lion, or of a John Cougar Mellencamp, just that those three entities are not the same thing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="63d90029fa404788975f4678c771df7f"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0fJyXvO" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>FSL relies far less on labelled data (i.e. pictures of rabbits) in favor of a generalized system, more akin to how humans learn than conventional AIs. “It’s first trained on billions of generic and open-source language examples,” per a Wednesday Meta blog post. “Then, the AI system is trained with <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__transparency.fb.com_features_approach-2Dto-2Dranking_content-2Ddistribution-2Dguidelines_content-2Dborderline-2Dto-2Dthe-2Dcommunity-2Dstandards_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=nq7G5BV3pUJKzCGIu8cu5_tCus3U1C00PIx5p0WG07A&amp;m=W_gGKUlJZmdjHRDSGJwMk1WvQKkih20AvL1uv-AHrdA&amp;s=iykgbeuxOzQP-V5xTgniBEzjaSAwPNs4WBMZ4LIur3M&amp;e=">integrity-specific data</a> we’ve labeled over the years. Finally, it’s trained on condensed text explaining a new policy.” And unlike the rabbit-matching model above, FSL “is pretrained on both general language and integrity-specific language so it can learn the policy text implicitly.”</p><p>Recent tests of the FSL system have proven encouraging. Meta researchers looked at the change in prevalence of harmful content shown to Facebook and Instagram users before and after FSL’s activation on the sites. The system both found harmful content that conventional SL models had missed and reduced the prevalence of that content in general. The FSL system reportedly outperformed other few-shot models by as much as 55 percent (though only 12 percent on average).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/969af200-57a5-11ec-9f2f-58cccf12ef42" alt="FSL Prevalence Graph the numbers are going down" data-uuid="d2f3768b-8bcd-39f2-9c32-95084353d122"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>FSL’s improved performance is thanks in part to entailment, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entailment#:~:text=noun,an%20entailment%20of%20the%20job.">defined as</a> “the act or fact of entailing, or involving by necessity or as a consequence.” It’s essentially a logical consequence between two sentences — if sentence A is true, then sentence B must also be true. For example, if sentence A is “The President was assassinated,” then it entails that sentence B, “the President is dead,” is also true, accurate and correct. By leveraging entailment in the FSL system, the team is able to “convert the class label into a natural language sentence which can be used to describe the label, and determine if the example entails the label description,” Meta AI researchers explained. So instead of trying to generalize what a conventional SL model knows from its training set (hundreds of thousands of rabbit pics) to the test set (“are these two images of rabbits?”), the FSL model can more broadly recognize harmful content when it sees it, because it understands the policy that the content violates.</p><p>The added flexibility of having a “single, shared knowledge base and backbone” could one day enable AI moderation systems to recognize and react to new forms of harmful content far more quickly, catch more content that just barely skirts around current policies and even help Meta develop and better define future policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-prototype-moderation-ai-only-needs-a-few-examples-of-bad-behavior-to-take-action-170005410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ae0fcc97-8149-4a28-9d2c-f39045d7e3fc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638983854</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:17:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A 3D printed Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta and Facebook logo are seen in this illustration taken on November 2, 2021.

The smart speaker firm has <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/newsroom/sonos-sustainability">unveiled</a> an inaugural climate plan that will make its &quot;value chain&quot; carbon neutral by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

Fiscal 2023 will also mark the release of Sonos&#39; first devices designed explicitly with recycling and reuse in mind, such as easier-to-remove fasteners in place of glue.

Neutrality in 2030 isn&#39;t an aggressive target when it includes offsets — Sonos will still produce excess CO2 emissions.

From security cameras to smart light bulbs, pretty much any internet-connected device that you can control via an app is enough to get you started on your smart home journey. But before you dive in, we advise taking a few preliminary steps. For one, don’t try to outfit your entire smart home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. From there, you can figure out if you want to buy more devices, making sure that they’re compatible with one another. Below are our suggestions for the best of each smart device category, with alternate suggestions where appropriate.</p><h2>Before you start, pick a voice assistant</h2><p>While plenty of smart home devices are platform agnostic, there are some — smart speakers and smart displays in particular — that require you to choose your voice assistant. Currently, that means deciding if you’ll use the Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa on a regular basis. (I’ll address Siri in a moment.) They’re both compatible with various smart home products from light bulbs to robot vacuums, but there are certain devices that work best with either Google or Amazon. Nest products, for example, are more compatible with Google-powered speakers and displays. They can still work with Amazon devices, but certain features might be disabled. The same holds true with Amazon products: They work better if they’re in the same ecosystem.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how do you choose between Alexa and Google Assistant? It really depends on your personal preferences. Do you listen to Audible, watch Prime Video and tend to do a lot of shopping on Amazon? Then you might lean toward an Alexa-powered product. Do you use a lot of Google services like YouTube and Google Podcasts? A Google-powered device might be best.</p><p>If you want a voice assistant that’s great at answering questions, Google Assistant tends to be better than Alexa. Amazon’s helper, on the other hand, currently supports more smart home products. The company’s smart speakers and displays also support the Zigbee smart home protocol, and some devices even have built-in smart home hubs. Both Google and Amazon devices can sync with your calendar, though Google’s tend to work better with Google services. Plus, if you already have an Android phone, you might be more comfortable with Google Assistant anyway.</p><p>But what about Siri? Apple’s assistant is an option as well, but it doesn’t have the same level of device support as Google and Amazon. The HomePod mini and the (now discontinued) HomePod are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market at the moment, too. That said, it’s not too hard to find HomeKit-compatible gear as more third-party companies add support for it, but you currently have a smaller pool of devices to choose from.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best smart speaker: Sonos One</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/914b9040-7a8c-11ea-9ee7-aa6c14e6afb5" alt="Sonos One smart speaker." data-uuid="77872500-1368-45aa-9f4c-36cc0673f1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham</div></figure><p>Our recommendation for the best smart speaker is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos One" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla">Sonos One</a>. It’s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that’s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room — which requires the iOS app — the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn’t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it’s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It’s also compatible with a slew of  streaming services, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it’s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time. It’s also convenient if you plan on building a home theater setup later on, as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-18-sonos-one-review.html">One</a> integrates well with Sonos soundbars. On top of that, the Sonos One supports both Alexa and Google Assistant, so you don’t have to worry about picking one voice assistant over the other.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla" id="ac81c869b45542adb77c867ca0fda046" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sonos;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Sonos One at Sonos - $219</a><h3>Runner-up: Amazon Echo Studio</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/84def960-de40-11ea-9df7-585cf9572509" alt="Amazon Echo Studio" data-uuid="6d7ee036-22bd-4f67-9ea9-23309a9cdc72"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re not interested in a multi-room audio setup, we also like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#x002019;s Echo Studio" href="https://amzn.to/3otXvYe">Amazon’s Echo Studio</a>.

It has a 7-inch screen, which makes it just big enough to fit in most rooms in the house. The size also makes it work well as a digital photo frame. You can set it up to pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and there’s a smart algorithm that automatically uses the best shots while avoiding the blurry ones. As you might expect, you can also use the display to watch YouTube, Netflix and other streaming services.</p><p>Plus, a smart display without a camera is great if you want to place it in more intimate places like the bedroom, where you might be more protective of your privacy. If you place it by your bedside, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a> also has a sensor that can track your sleep patterns, if you opt in.</p><p>If you prefer a display with a camera, we recommend splurging on the higher-end <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub Max" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW">Nest Hub Max</a>. Its built-in camera can be used for video calls with Google Duo, Google Meet and Zoom. It also has an optional face-tracking feature that lets the camera follow you around during calls. One benefit of the camera is that it gives you the option for Face Match, a feature that automatically recognizes individual members of the house and then displays the information that’s pertinent only to them, like calendar alerts.</p><p>Additionally, the camera adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen, which is convenient if you need to stop the music without having to shout across the room. The Nest Hub Max also has better audio quality than the Hub thanks to its larger speakers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3wHhGp9" id="38b68d24b5ce4340a364331a4bddff54" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub at B&amp;H - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW" id="57bace0447e945a09c3067c4cb5a8d52" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub Max at B&amp;H - $230</a><h3>Best smart lights: Philips Hue</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/5574d7a0-0d69-11eb-a5d9-6907f548d61e" alt="Philips Hue smart light bulbs" data-uuid="02e675c4-0dd2-30fb-bc04-78a9c7e9eb7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon / Philips</div></figure><p>One of the easiest entry points to the smart home is to swap out some of your existing light bulbs with smart ones. Smart light bulbs let you control your lighting remotely, either via an app and with your voice. They add automation and scheduling to the mix, so you can have them turn on and off at certain times of the day. Some also let you adjust their brightness and color temperature, or even let you create a custom light scene.</p><p>Our favorite smart lighting products come from Philips Hue, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6">White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit</a> is a particularly good entry point as it includes three Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 60W LED smart bulbs; a Hue hub that lets you control up to 50 lights; and a Smart Button if you want to have the option of turning off the lights without having your phone around.</p><p>This kit offers lots of versatility in lighting styles; you can change not just the brightness but also the color temperature and experiment with all different shades of the rainbow, decking out your room in whatever light scene you desire. If that seems a little too daring, Philips offers alternatives: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3CeFthg">Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit</a> lacks the color option, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3wDkCmw">Hue White Starter Kit</a> won’t let you adjust the color temperature.</p><p>The main reason we prefer Philips Hue bulbs is that they’re widely supported across smart home ecosystems. Not only can you find them pretty much anywhere, but they’ll work with Google, Amazon and Apple’s HomeKit. Since all the bulbs connect to the Hue hub via the Zigbee protocol (and not your home’s WiFi), it tends to be more reliable and it won’t slow down your home internet connection either.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6" id="9fe2ec724416420ba4f7f91a1ba5627c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Philips Hue starter set at Best Buy - $130</a><h3>Best budget smart lights: Cync by GE</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49403500-582d-11ec-bef3-22d267ca3d71" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="GE Cync smart light bulbs" data-uuid="fa1de799-ca8a-35b7-9c23-8b292251791c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>If you’re not quite ready to dive into a whole lighting ecosystem or you just prefer a more affordable alternative, we suggest GE’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb" href="https://amzn.to/3C9FSlg">Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb</a>.

It, too, offers an array of lighting options in all manner of colors, and you can set schedules as well.

Our favorite is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wyze Cam V3" href="https://amzn.to/3wEvSiF">Wyze Cam V3</a> for its wide range of features along with its affordable price. Plus, thanks to its IP65 waterproof rating it can be used either indoors or outdoors, and it has color night vision that’s capable of recording nighttime video in full color.</p><p>Like previous-gen models, it sends alerts to your phone whenever it detects sound or motion. You can also customize Motion Detection Zones that allow you to adjust just how sensitive you want it to be. It also offers 24/7 continuous video recording that you can store via a 32GB microSD card (not included).</p><p>We especially like that the Wyze doesn’t require a subscription; free cloud storage is included with the purchase, and you’ll always have access to the last 14 days of recording on the app. Be warned, however, that the free account can only hold 12-second clips every five minutes. If you want it to record unlimited motion, consider upgrading to a Cam Plus subscription, which includes additional features like alerting you if it detects a person or a package. Fortunately, it’s inexpensive at $2 a month or $15 a year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wEvSiF" id="0c4e455f1d3546ac8428322ecb234593" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Wyze Cam V3 at Amazon - $36</a><h3>Best wireless security camera: Blink cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/2d0766e0-327e-11eb-9fb5-f5f70d69930a" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Blink Outdoor and Indoor cameras" data-uuid="aa2aeee8-9d34-3dd5-8180-35356b8c3035"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>There’s a lot to like about the Wyze Cam V3, but it needs to be plugged in.

They both run on AA batteries, so you can place them anywhere you want, and they’ll run for around two years before you need to replace the batteries. The Blink Outdoor is weather resistant, but otherwise both cameras are the same. They both have night vision, motion detection and two-way audio. You can store clips in the cloud via the Blink Subscription Plan or you can also save events locally to a Sync Module 2 via a USB flash drive (sold separately). Unfortunately, Blink works with Alexa only, which could be a non-starter for some.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wE8UYS" id="ed24a17cfe3a44c9a13873dcd4f6794d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Indoor at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3c87ah2" id="2b710ffa1b014510a96e6d3c8deaaa71" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Outdoor at Amazon - $90</a><h3>Best doorbell camera: Arlo Essential Video Doorbell</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/60d237f0-800a-11eb-8f6f-b663ffc7fde9" style="height:1241;width:2000;" alt="Arlo video doorbell" data-uuid="443fe154-d8a4-3f2a-8f30-1639f91f85be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you want a camera specifically for your front door, a doorbell camera makes more sense than a standalone option.

It delivers high-quality HDR footage along with a 180-degree view so you can see a person from head to toe and it can ring your phone with a video call whenever someone rings the bell. There’s also two-way audio so you can talk to whoever’s at the door.</p><p>A highlight of this doorbell is that it comes with a three-month trial to Arlo’s Smart subscription service, which includes a motion detection feature that can tell the difference between a person, package, vehicle or animal. Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">said</a> that he really appreciated the package alerts; it did a good job of telling him whenever UPS dropped off a box. It’s such a useful feature, in fact, that we recommend keeping the service beyond the trial period.</p><p>You should be able to use the Arlo Essential Video Doorbell with either Google or Amazon’s smart displays, but it won’t be fully integrated. You’ll be able to view the webcam on the display, but if someone rings the doorbell, they won’t automatically show up on the screen.

We recommended it in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> as it did a great job cleaning hard and carpeted surfaces. (We liked the Shark Ion RV761, too, but the Roomba 694 is a newer model.) Plus, the app is really easy to use for luddites and the tech savvy alike. And just in case you don’t have access to the app — maybe you left your phone in another room, for example — the Roomba 694 has manual controls as well.</p><p>One of the reasons the Roomba 694 cleans so well is that it has a three-stage system that tells it to suck up dirt while also navigating around obstacles. When it encounters an especially filthy area, it focuses in on it, making sure it’s clean before moving on. You can also manually instruct it to clean a specific spot in case you need it. And if you prefer to talk to your robot vacuum, the Roomba 694 works well with both Alexa and Google Assistant.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HgVKpz" id="4a6535ec304448c9aa6601316bb3c014" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $275</a><h3>Best high-end robot vacuum: iRobot Roomba i7+</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/4d25a5d0-dd70-11ea-b7ff-ddeb3a0d2525" style="height:1028;width:1600;" alt="iRobot Roomba i7+" data-uuid="7819e0d4-2ec1-4e5f-8a74-23637c74a45d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don’t mind spending more money on an even better robot vacuum, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba i7+" href="https://amzn.to/3qxI1oK">Roomba i7+</a>.

You probably won&#39;t buy a TV with Stadia in mind, but this significantly widens the number of sets where native support is an option — you might be more inclined to try it if the barrier to entry is that much lower.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-lg-smart-tv-release-date-152718368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64752abf-fae3-4f24-b1b0-f52414eb4087</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:27:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976469</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polestar will increase its EV's horsepower with a €1,000 software update]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html"><ins>Polestar 2&#39;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower.

The feature is part of Facebook parent Meta&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">$1 billion investment</a> in creators that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html">bonuses</a> for Instagram influencers and an expansion to the Stars program <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114137082634871">announced yesterday</a> by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest feature of professional mode profiles is the addition of the Reels Play <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses">bonus program</a> that allows creators to earn up to $35,000 a month based on views of qualifying reels (videos). Previously, that program was only open to users with Pages. It&#39;ll be invitation-only for professional profiles to start with, with more information about how to create reels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/reels-for-facebook">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of Reels, Facebook is planning to add the ability to create longer, 60 second reels, save drafts mid-creation and create compositions from multiple clips. Those features are coming &quot;soon&quot; and it&#39;s planning to expand Reels to more countries next year, too. Professional Mode also lets profiles see the same kind of post and audience analytics data that Page users get, including shares, reactions and comments. You can also see your follower growth over time.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a caveat that, not surprisingly, involves privacy. Once you turn on professional mode, &quot;anyone can follow you and see your public content in their feed,&quot; Facebook said. However, you&#39;ll still be able to limit specific posts or updates to friends only.</p><p>Facebook is playing catchup to rival platforms with the creator community, particularly TikTok, which recently passed 3 billion downloads and is ahead of Facebook in user engagement. On top of the new profiles, it recently introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">Stars store website</a> that lets creators earn cash from followers without paying app store commissions. Professional mode is testing with a limited number of profiles today in the US, but will be expanded to more people in the US &quot;soon&quot; and more countries in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-introduces-a-new-professional-mode-for-creators-140006876.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd9bdd0f-4477-4363-b683-aa4a167dc39a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638967259</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T12:41:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[8Bitdo's SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update, 1:17pm ET:</strong> The Lightning Deal on the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro+ has now expired.</p><p>8Bitdo controllers have been some of our favorites thanks to their charming designs and affordable prices. We called one of the latest, the SN30 Pro+, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-8bitdo-sn30-pro-plus-controller-impressions.html">near-perfect Nintendo Switch controller</a> and now you can get that accessory at its best price yet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sn30 Pro+" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS">SN30 Pro+</a> is down to $40 today as a Lightning Deal on Amazon, which means you have roughly six hours from the time of writing this to grab it before the price goes back up to $50. This is the same deal we saw on Black Friday, so if you missed it then, you have another opportunity to get it today.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS" id="4b9c6ef95ef44a09a0444cff60c0d9a3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8Bitdo SN30 Pro+ at Amazon - $40</a><p>The SN30 Pro+ will look familiar to those who loved the SNES. It has a similar design to that console&#39;s controller with a D-pad, circular A, B, X and Y buttons and start and select buttons in the middle. But it also has handles for better ergonomics, along with analog sticks and two more buttons. It&#39;s well-built and lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag and take with you when you want to play with your Switch on the go. While plenty of people will want to use it with Nintendo&#39;s console, the SN30 Pro+ is also compatible with PC, macOS, Android, Steam and Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Not only did we find the SN30 Pro+ to be even more comfortable than Nintendo&#39;s own Switch Pro Controller, it also has the added benefit of a removable battery pack. It&#39;ll last about 20 hours on a single charge, but in a pinch, you can take out that pack and replace it with AA batteries instead. That&#39;ll come in handy on long flights, camping trips and other situations in which you can&#39;t charge up for a while. We also appreciate that the <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo Ultimate Software</a> lets you personalize the controller a bit further by remapping buttons and creating custom profiles.</p><p>The few gripes we had with the SN30 Pro+ were its somewhat tedious syncing process with the Switch (but thankfully you only have to do that once), its lack of a headphone jack and its lack of support for iOS, Xbox and PlayStation. However, if you&#39;re looking for a stocking stuffer for the gamer in your life, the SN30 Pro+ is hard to beat at this sale price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdos-sn-30-pro-plus-controller-drops-to-40-for-today-only-133621646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c346769f-65d3-4033-bc65-9476f32d180d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:36:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638987447</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T18:17:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[8Bitdo&#39;s SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple was reportedly forced to halt iPhone and iPad assembly for the first time in a decade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple was forced to cease <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone</a> and iPad production for several days when it was supposed to kick into high gear, according to a report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Apple-s-nightmare-before-Christmas-Supply-chain-crisis-delays-gift-deliveries"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>.

But this is reportedly the first time in a decade that the company had to cease operations at its factories during China&#39;s Golden Week.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple factories typically ramp up production during the Chinese holidays that take place at the beginning of October, running 24 hour shifts so that it can keep up with holiday shopping demands. This year, though, it reportedly gave its workers some time off instead. A supply chain manager told the publication that it made no sense to pay workers overtime for working during the holidays when there were very limited component and chips to work with. As a result, people who may be thinking of getting a new iPad or a new iPhone as a Christmas gift for loved ones or themselves may not get it in time for the season.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Nikkei Asia</em> says that supply chain issues started way before the pandemic, when Chinese companies blacklisted by the United States hoarded inventories to survive crackdowns. That said, the COVID-19 lockdowns implemented in Malaysia and Vietnam due to the Delta variant heavily affected the production of numerous electrical components and chips.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, bottlenecks weren&#39;t caused by the lack of a device&#39;s most expensive components, but its cheaper peripheral parts. Component manufacturers that don&#39;t have as much purchasing power as tech giants fall to the back of the list when it comes to raw materials, after all. For the iPhone 13 Max, for instance, tiny peripherals that only cost a few cents each are what&#39;s causing the delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple chief Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html">previously said</a> that the company lost $6 billion for the quarter ending in September due to supply chain constraints, and that he believes that it could lose more in the final quarter of the year. It still remains to be seen if Apple would still enjoy the same level of demand by the time it has the components to manufacture its devices. <em>Nikkei Asia</em> says Apple told suppliers that demand persists for the iPhone 13 and to reaccelerate their component production for November, December and January. According to a previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html"><em>Bloomberg report</em></a>, though, Apple warned suppliers that demand for its biggest revenue source has already weakened just before the holidays.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-forced-to-halt-iphone-ipad-assembly-131714897.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e8fd40c-67ed-4bef-9f0d-b1f6dbb935ac</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:17:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638969623</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:20:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Hubble telescope wakes up from 'hibernation']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s Hubble telescope has been in a month-long nap since going into system failure in late October. However, early yesterday, the agency announced it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">waking Hubble up</a>. NASA says the telescope is now functioning as normal, with all four active instruments collecting data.</p><p>On October 23rd, NASA first noticed Hubble&#39;s instruments weren&#39;t receiving messages from the telescope&#39;s control unit. NASA ended up putting the telescope into a sort of safe mode while it tried to figure out what happened. That safe mode takes a long time to come out of because of the sensitivity of Hubble&#39;s hardware. Rapid power or temperature changes aren&#39;t good for its lifespan. The telescope is now 31 years old — Hubble may be nearing the end of its useful life in space. NASA will use the telescope till the end, though, planning to use it in tandem with the Webb telescope, which is expected to finally launch on December 22nd.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-premium-memberships-announcement-160019679.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Discord gives server owners the tools to put channels behind a paywall</a></h2><h3>The company is testing Premium Memberships with a small group of users.</h3><h3></h3><p>Discord has started testing a feature called Premium Memberships.

Matches for the T20 World Cup are at the top of this year&#39;s global searches, along with other sporting events, such as the UEFA Euro 2021 and the NBA, and the hit Netlix Korean series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a>.

COVID remains a hot topic, as you&#39;d expect, with COVID vaccines, stimulus checks and the virus itself joining Afghanistan in the top trending news list. It seems like more and more people are getting into cryptocurrency, as well — or at least getting curious about it — and showed special interest in Dogecoin and Ethereum prices. Current events, including Hurricane Ida and the Georgia Senate race, and meme stocks (AMC and GME) round up the list.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it comes to the top trending people of the year, Alec Baldwin holds the top spot, followed by Kyle Rittenhouse. President Biden and athletes Tiger Woods and Simone Biles made waves this year, as well.

Marvel movies were as popular as ever, with <em>Eternals</em> holding the top spot for trending films, followed by <em>Black Widow</em>. <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> are also in the list, along with other hits for the year, such as <em>Dune</em> and <em>Red Notice</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the attention of people everywhere, and it&#39;s joined by <em>Bridgerton</em>, <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Cobra Kai</em> and <em>Loki</em> in the top trending TV shows list.

Finally, people around the world apparently had cravings for Birria tacos, nasi goreng, feta pasta, shōgayaki and charcuterie boards this year.</p><p>You can check out the whole Year in Search results across various categories <a href="https://about.google/stories/year-in-search-2021/">right here</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-year-in-search-2021-091628080.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35cc2c28-ef85-4b72-b761-27b27ce8ae17</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 09:16:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638955038</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T12:14:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f0c8e8c0-57f7-11ec-af9f-67c7c75348c4" width="4512" height="3008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f0c8e8c0-57f7-11ec-af9f-67c7c75348c4" width="4512" height="3008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Darrian Traynor via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA - NOVEMBER 18: Glenn Maxwell, Bayley Fritsch, Aaron Finch, Angus Brayshaw and Matthew Wade pose for a photo with the T20 World Cup Trophy and the AFL Premiership Cup during an Australian T20 World Cup Media Opportunity at Melbourne Cricket Ground on November 18, 2021 in Melbourne, Australia.

Verizon (Engadget<em>&#39;s</em> former parent company) collected users&#39; location, web browsing and mobile application usage data to send them marketing messages or offers under Selects, though subscribers could opt out if they wanted to. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/verizon-ignored-users-previous-opt-outs-in-latest-push-to-scan-web-browsing/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, the carrier recently replaced its Selects program with the Verizon Custom Experience Plus and Custom Experience programs. And that&#39;s all well and good, except users have been receiving emails to tell them that they&#39;d been automatically enrolled.</p><p>In the email, Verizon stated that they will be included in the programs, which means their data will be collected, even if they previously opted out of participating in Selects.

The carrier also wrote that it keeps browsing information for no more than 6 months. It keeps location and phone number information for approximately one year.&nbsp;</p><p>To remove themselves from the program, users will have to opt out again. While we&#39;re sure a lot of subscribers wouldn&#39;t appreciate being enrolled into marketing programs they previously chose not to participate in, it&#39;s at least easy to unsubscribe. They can go to their Verizon account&#39;s privacy preferences page or &quot;My Verizon&quot; in their mobile app and head to &quot;Manage Settings&quot; or &quot;Manage Privacy Settings&quot; to toggle off both programs.&nbsp;</p><div id="2a3abf57a24740e2ab60a6cf3fb7711a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Uh yeah no fucking thank you, verizon <a href="https://t.co/QgWxQjVMiq">pic.twitter.com/QgWxQjVMiq</a></p>— Jordan&#39;s Happy House of Horrors (@jordanhirsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/jordanhirsch/status/1467969318235381761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-custom-experience-054918415.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c142c19-2c2a-4bc6-9a58-3a200a01ddd8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 05:49:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638970515</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:35:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/59276730-57e3-11ec-bffd-da008b72936f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/59276730-57e3-11ec-bffd-da008b72936f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Indianapolis - Circa March 2021: Verizon Wireless Retail Location.

There&#39;s a version with a clamp for Android phones and older iPhones, but the star of the show is the MagSafe model — you won&#39;t completely sully the design of your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 12 or 13</a>.</p><p>This being a Razer accessory, you can expect the seemingly obligatory RGB lighting (controlled through Bluetooth) as well as a high-powered seven-blade fan that remains quiet at about 30dB.
