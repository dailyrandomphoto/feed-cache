Core stars Ella Purnell (Jinx), Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Katie Leung (Caitlyn) are already set to reprise their roles.</p><p>There&#39;s no mystery behind the decision: the show is a success. Co-creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee said they were &quot;beyond happy&quot; with the reaction. The numbers also back them up ‚Äî the first season of <em>Arcane</em> racked up nearly 34.2 million viewing hours in its first week on Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-top-10-chart-transparency-213412386.html">new top 10 chart</a>, making it the second-most popular TV series in any language behind <em>Narcos: Mexico</em> (almost 50.3 million).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The popularity isn&#39;t a shock. Both Netflix and <em>League</em> creator Riot Games heavily promoted the show, to the point where <em>LoL</em> included multiple crossovers. You knew <em>Arcane</em> was available if you were even vaguely interested in the game that inspired it. And yes, it helps that <em>Arcane</em> happens to be well-received by many accounts.</p><p>The renewal doesn&#39;t necessarily hint at a new wave of game-inspired Netflix shows. It does, however, suggest that relatively high-budget game productions have a healthy future at the streaming pioneer. Don&#39;t be surprised if Netflix takes more chances on projects like this.</p><div id="70f443c97c6b401c9230b256966f3e26"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ready yourselves, friends.

Albums should be listened to &quot;as [artists] intended&quot; as they tell &quot;a story,&quot; the singer explained in a follow-up on Twitter.</p><p>You can still shuffle an album using the controls for individual songs. This mainly adds an extra step and pushes you to choose a first track. Rivals like Apple Music still let you tap a &quot;shuffle&quot; button from an album page.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no question some albums are meant to be played in order, including <em>30</em>. It weaves a narrative around an important time in Adele&#39;s life. However, critics have already raised concerns about removing a feature to please an artist. It&#39;s one thing to recommend playing albums a certain way, but it&#39;s another to take control away from listeners to dictate that order ‚Äî and what about artists who are happy to allow shuffle play?</p><p>Spotify has an incentive to make changes like this, at least. Adele&#39;s lead single for <em>30</em>, &quot;Easy On Me,&quot; broke a single-day Spotify streaming record previously held by K-pop megagroup BTS. While Spotify hasn&#39;t outlined its rationale, the company probably isn&#39;t eager to antagonize one of its most important musicians and risk losing customers.</p><div id="dd3791e6496e4ca486c04e05f846b00d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was the only request I had in our ever changing industry!

Meta, then Facebook, started a broader push toward encryption and other privacy features in 2019.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The delay could lead to awkward timing, at least in the UK. The country is enacting a safety law in 2023 that will require tech companies to prevent abuse and safeguard children. While it doesn&#39;t require <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-how-ag-barr-is-going-to-get-encryption-backdoors.html">encryption backdoors</a>, current UK home secretary Priti Patel hasn&#39;t been shy about opposing default encryption ‚Äî she claimed it would &quot;severely&quot; limit law enforcement&#39;s ability to pursue criminals. Meta might face pressure to change its plans by the time the law takes effect.</p><p>Davis said Meta would still have the power to detect abuse through a combination of unencrypted info and user reports. The delay might also offer time to reassure governments and head off potential conflicts. Chat encryption isn&#39;t under immediate threat, then, but the longer timeframe adds some uncertainty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-instagram-default-message-encryption-164246622.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f2e6d146-c3a7-4b50-bdd6-6e2207114a2a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 16:42:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637512968</ingested><modified>2021-11-21T16:42:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/d877a620-16f5-11ea-ab7b-0770d8aa9f2e" width="5003" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/d877a620-16f5-11ea-ab7b-0770d8aa9f2e" width="5003" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - May 1,2019: Apple iPhone XR showing Instagram application on mobile]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone XR showing Instagram application on mobile]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch SE and Fitbits drop to all-time low prices at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today could be a very good day to buy wearable tech as a gift.

As you might have guessed, though, this wasn&#39;t the results of a (non-existent) feature update during that period. Rather, the blame appears to rest on app prompts and more than a little confusion.</p><p>The iPhone maker told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">iOS 15.1</a> started prompting users for ratings and reviews &quot;just like most third-party apps.&quot; However, many people thought they were rating the show they were listening to, not the app ‚Äî and that led to a flood of scores and reviews for podcasts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This issue hasn&#39;t affected many other first-party apps, such as Apple Maps (2.8 stars as of this writing).

At the same time, though, the mixups are inflating Podcasts&#39; value and rendering the scores useless for many people deciding on podcast clients. The shift also underscores the problem with trusting ratings and reviews regardless of platform. It&#39;s still relatively easy for misguided users, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-palestinian-activists-facebook-app-rating-protest-211008340.html">activists</a> and fraudsters to skew that feedback.</p><div id="f9d9a30d81dd41219c859a384529769b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: <a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3">pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3</a></p>‚Äî Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-app-review-score-prompts-215857401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a03308b1-595c-4c9e-8bd2-9b4a2caa3fa9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 21:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637445539</ingested><modified>2021-11-20T21:59:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Podcast application is seen on an Apple iPad on October 24, 2017.

First, Mat Smith checked out the new SharePlay feature on iOS 15.1 and determined it has potential. Next, Billy Steele listened to the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones and found them to be just as comfortable as their predecessors, and with improved noise cancellation, too. Nathan Ingraham put the HP Chromebook X2 to the test and found the lightweight laptop has a stellar screen that‚Äôs ideal for travel. Steve Dent turned the dial on ASUS‚Äôs ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED laptop, which he says has an exceptionally color accurate screen and thoughtful features for creatives. Finally, Terrence O‚ÄôBrien made a few stickers and decals with the Cricut Explore 3.</p><h2>iOS 15.1 rolls out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">new SharePlay feature</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cd60a720-4969-11ec-bef3-d5f411982434" alt="Apple iOS 15.1" data-uuid="b3a19b3e-7790-3e4e-baa1-4608cdb299f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Mat Smith calls iOS 15.1 a relatively minor update when compared to the more drastic changes brought by iOS 14. A good bulk of the additions here come from the release of SharePlay, which allows you to do things like stream TV shows with a friend over FaceTime. Mat said that the shows were lag free in testing, the fitness apps were motivating and the free games were more fun than he expected. However, SharePlay isn‚Äôt available for all apps ‚Äî for instance, YouTube and Netflix are not supported right now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mat also tested spatial audio, which gives callers directional sound, but he was more impressed by the new voice isolation and wide modes. He also played around with Focus modes, which help you track and limit your screen time via profiles and the ability to ‚Äúlock‚Äù yourself out of your phone for set periods of time. Mat points out that these features, in addition to the machine learning improvements with Visual Look-up and Live Text, show that Apple is rededicating itself towards sharing.</p><h2>HP‚Äôs Chromebook X2 makes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-chromebook-x2-review-162005261.html">a great first impression</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7b0ddd70-496a-11ec-bc57-06274e606c55" alt="HP Chromebook X2" data-uuid="cc7b511e-ba38-3df1-ac59-b96320056fe2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham found the hardware on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">HP Chromebook X2</a> to be well built, sturdy and simple in design. He called the bright 11-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 touchscreen a standout that made work feel less cramped thanks in part to its 3:2 aspect ratio. The keyboard was responsive with good travel, and he liked that the included stylus attached neatly and magnetically to the side. When it came to performance, he found the X2 to do well for watching videos, browsing the web and playing games.</p><p>However, he found the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c mobile processor struggled when it came time to push the machine with intensive tasks. Though he was able to run his usual programs, it wasn‚Äôt the fastest experience and he said he avoided playing music from the device while running a lot of other apps because it would cause slowdowns. That being said, its stellar battery life, size and lightweight design make the Chromebook X2 a solid secondary or travel device.</p><h2>The ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html">laptop for creatives</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a977e250-496a-11ec-8be5-ce2e9acfd640" alt="ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED" data-uuid="c51a6c48-bed2-37de-8a31-dbd71038ad3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook</a> is clearly intended to woo artists and creatives with its fast performance, gorgeous 16-inch 4K OLED screen and the ‚ÄúASUS dial‚Äù for video and photo editing. The screen is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, and has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky blacks that make it good for content creation and streaming entertainment. It also features an ‚ÄúIceCool Pro‚Äù thermal solution to boost airflow while keeping noise levels minimal. Steve found this to hold true during testing, except for very GPU/CPU intensive tasks, which did bump up the noise levels.</p><p>He was also particularly impressed with the dial, which he says feels nice with a textured grip and smooth rotation. The location is convenient and the dial can be used to adjust volume or display brightness as well as to access menu options from four Adobe apps. Steve was also pleased with the number of ports on the machine, including a USB-C with DisplayPort support and an SD Express card slot. In testing, the laptop performed well during both gaming and editing tasks, thanks in part to a RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 CPU. On top of that, Steve found it had a solid battery life, too, which lead him to declare the Studiobook 16 the best Windows 10 laptop for content creation.</p><h2>Bose makes minor but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">appreciated updates</a> with the QuietComfort 45 headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f9ecf5e0-496a-11ec-976b-610c6b36e5c0" alt="Bose QuietComfort 45" data-uuid="10c057d0-fbdf-36db-a3e5-06805c781eba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele isn‚Äôt disappointed that Bose didn‚Äôt update the design of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:QuietComfort 45" href="https://amzn.to/3csDpIf">QuietComfort 45</a> headphones. In fact, he was pleased that the company kept so much of what made the previous model popular, from the light weight to the physical buttons and cushiony pads. He reports that the new headphones keep the sound quality that Bose is known for, with crisp highs, robust mids and deep bass. The QC45 sounded good across multiple genres and the updated noise cancelling removed more background sounds than the last model.</p><p>New to the QC45 is an ambient sound or aware mode, which allows you to hear what‚Äôs happening around you. Billy said it‚Äôs serviceable but not the best he‚Äôs experienced. While testing, he managed to get 22.5 hours worth of playback before he needed to recharge the headphones. However, he did find the multi-device connectivity a bit frustrating as it required him to reconnect after ending a call. Overall, he still feels that the newest QuietComfort cans offer a lot for folks who travel frequently and need a comfortable set of headphones with exceptional noise cancelling capabilities.</p><h2>Cricut‚Äôs Explore 3 cutting machine is for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html">devoted crafters</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6cd6650-496b-11ec-b7ce-a0eba766a7dd" alt="Circuit Explore 3" data-uuid="340d0376-7646-3315-8981-6f93bf9be0b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O‚ÄôBrien admits he‚Äôs not the core audience for a Circuit craft machine. Designed to cut hundreds of different types of materials, the Circuit line can make vinyl transfers for shirts, 3D cardboard masks, stickers, decals, iron-ons and more. However, his beginner crafting level didn‚Äôt stop him from thoroughly enjoying the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Explore 3" href="https://fave.co/3nraY3E">Cricut Explore 3</a>, which he said felt like magic to use. In testing, he created a Spiderman emblem for a Halloween costume, several laptop stickers and (most of) a 3D cardboard fox.</p><p>Terrence said he found the companion app easy to use: it also offers access to over 1,000 free images and 250 projects. Even more are available via the $10 a month Cricut Access membership and you can upload your own designs. He appreciated the detailed instructions for the predesigned projects, but points out that projects often required a lot of additional add-ons like a scoring stylus or foil transfer tool. Overall, Terrence says whether or not the $300 Explore 3 (or $400 Maker 3) is worth it to you is going to depend a lot on how often you‚Äôll use it ‚Äî and what other materials you already have on hand.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-its-finally-time-to-test-shareplay-on-apple-ios-15-1-170037187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e89f24f6-2c7b-4fc1-bcc7-5e4c7bdc9549</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637350812</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T19:40:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c17040-42ee-11ec-b91b-0b35e1ae5116" width="2000" height="1363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c17040-42ee-11ec-b91b-0b35e1ae5116" width="2000" height="1363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: An ode to the joy of antibiotics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stress and uncertainty surrounding the COVID pandemic, along with misinformation about the life-saving vaccines developed in response have <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/aaron-rodgers-discusses-positive-covid-19-test-im-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-woke-mob-right-now-173236045.html">broken many a weak mind</a> over the past two years, leading people to try everything from injecting themselves with bleach and inhaling nebulized hydrogen peroxide, to slugging down horse dewormer in misguided attempts to outwit modern medicine.

Workman Publishing ¬© 2021</p><hr><p>Aside from putting barriers between us and plagues, the next primary approach to defeating them was to attack them directly, thanks to breakthroughs in science that created and discovered antibiotics and antitoxins. Some of these medicines aren‚Äôt simply employed against microorganisms like bacteria, but act as antifungals, antivirals, and antiparasitics as well. Today, there are more than a hundred types of medicines in this group. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of medicines deemed essential for a country‚Äôs healthcare system to best care for its citizenry, and a large chunk of those essential meds battle infectious diseases.</p><p>Some might assume that penicillin was the first definitive weapon discovered in our fight against pathogens, but there were several that preceded it and broke significant ground when they were discovered.</p><p>The Prussian-born Emil von Behring was a doctor and an assistant to the famed Robert Koch at the Institute for Hygiene in Berlin. In 1888, he developed a way to treat those suffering from diphtheria and tetanus. Not a disease familiar to many these days, diphtheria is prevented by a vaccine that is usually coupled with your routine tetanus shot. In the 1800s, diphtheria was a terrible killer that inflamed a victim‚Äôs heart, inflicted paralysis, and caused a suffocating membrane to cover the throat. In Spain, the disease was so rampant in 1613 it was nicknamed <em>El A√±o de los Garrotillos</em>, or ‚ÄúThe Year of Strangulations.‚Äù</p><p>Much of the disease caused by diphtheria is driven by the toxin created by <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>. Von Behring infected rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs with weakened (attenuated) forms of it, then gathered their serum‚Äîthe liquid fraction of their blood, minus the red and white blood cells. That light, honey-colored liquid, which contained antibodies to the diphtheria toxin, was then injected into another set of animals that were sickened with fully virulent diphtheria bacteria.</p><p>The newly infected animals given the serum didn‚Äôt die because they gained a passive form of protection against the toxin with the donated serum. In 1891, a child‚Äôs life was saved using this new method for the first time. The serum was produced in large quantities using animals like sheep and horses. At a time when 50,000 children died annually from diphtheria, it was a miraculous treatment.</p><p>Tetanus serum was created soon after, becoming a workable treatment by 1915. Today, antitoxins are used to treat botulism, diphtheria, and anthrax. The same principles of antitoxin treatment are utilized for antivenom therapy to remedy poisonous animal bites, including those from black widow spiders, scorpions, box jellyfish, and cobras. A treatment called passive antibody therapy, in which the serum of patients recovered from an infection is given to other sick patients (also called convalescent plasma therapy), may have been helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic, though data is still forthcoming. Antibodies against infections can not only treat diseases like toxic shock syndrome, but prevent infections during exposures, such as those for hepatitis A and B and botulism. But the antibodies themselves have been employed to treat more than just bites, stings, and infections. Intravenous immunoglobulins from pooled donors treat a variety of disorders, such as ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) and severe immune deficiency diseases.</p><p>Another antibody therapy‚Äîmonoclonal antibodies‚Äîhas been a game-changer in treatments over the last decade or so, the first one approved by the FDA in 1986. These specially designed antibodies are used to treat several types of cancers (melanoma, breast, and stomach, among many others) and autoimmune diseases (including Crohn‚Äôs disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis). The antibodies themselves are Y-shaped proteins that bind to a specific protein. In doing so, they can elicit a whole range of effects: switching on or off immune system cascades, destroying cells, blocking or engaging cell activities. The antibodies only bind to a single antigen, hence ‚Äúmono,‚Äù and are produced by clones of cells that churn out the antibodies in large amounts. Sometimes they can also be bound to radioactive particles, delivering radioactivity directly to a cancer cell. Others can be bound to a chemotherapy agent. Often, they work alone.</p><p>In the realm of cancer therapy, most of us have some understanding of chemotherapy. But the origin of the term chemotherapy itself actually came from the fight to treat infections, not cancer. At the turn of the twentieth century, antibiotics had yet to establish themselves as a cure for infections. That changed with a physician and scientist named Paul Ehrlich. He was born in 1854 in East Prussia (now Poland) where his father ran a lottery office. During his career, he took advantage of the burgeoning German dye industry to experiment on how cells looked stained with different chemicals. His love of color led to some notable idiosyncrasies, like carrying colored pencil stubs in his pockets. But Ehrlich‚Äôs work led to what would become the famous Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain for tuberculosis. (Unfortunately, he also stained his very own TB bacteria from his sputum, though luckily survived the illness.) Later he collaborated with the aforementioned Emil von Behring, a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning physiologist, on serum therapy for tetanus and diphtheria.</p><p>But perhaps Ehrlich‚Äôs most notable discovery happened by accident as he sought a chemical cure to treat a specific disease‚Äîa ‚Äúchemotherapy.‚Äù Specifically, he hoped to cure sleeping sickness, a disease caused by a microscopic parasite called <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>. He had been working with a chemical called atoxyl (meaning ‚Äúnontoxic‚Äù), ironically an arsenic compound. Ehrlich coined the term ‚Äúmagic bullet‚Äù related to his hope of finding that perfect chemical that would hopefully kill a very specific pathogen, the <em>Trypanosoma</em> parasite, and not the patient. He ended up testing nine hundred variations of the arsenic compounds on mice. None were particularly effective, but he revisited #606 because it seemed to have an effect on a newly discovered bacterium believed to cause syphilis. In 1910, the medicine called Salvarsan (sometimes simply called ‚Äú606‚Äù) was proven to be effective‚Äîit killed the syphilis spirochete and left the guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice alive.</p><p>In the next few decades, new research would be applied to battle not just the pandemics of old, but daily infections that could upend people‚Äôs lives. A scratch or bite could kill if those <em>Staphylococcus</em> or <em>Streptococcus</em> infections spiraled out of control. A German scientist named Gerhard Domagk began working with a group of chemicals called azo dyes that had a characteristic double nitrogen bond. Azo dyes can color textiles, leather, and foods various shades of brilliant orange, red, and yellow. When an azo compound had a sulfonamide group attached (a nitrogen and sulfur link with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the sulfur, should you need to impress friends at a party), they knew they‚Äôd found something special. The sulfonamide group inhibits a bacteria‚Äôs ability to make folate, a necessary B vitamin. Humans, on the other hand, can obtain folate through their diet. And so another magic bullet was born. The new compound seemed to work in mice infected with <em>Streptococcus</em>, otherwise known as strep.</p><p>Domagk used the new medicine, called KL 730 and later patented as Prontosil, on his own daughter Hildegard. Suffering from a severe strep infection, she received a shot of Prontosil and recovered, though the drug left a telltale dyed, reddish discoloration at the injection site.</p><p>‚ÄúSulfa‚Äù drugs would go on to be used in a variety of medicines, including antibiotics (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, aka Bactrim), diabetes medicines (glyburide, a sulfonylurea), diuretics (furosemide, or Lasix), pain meds (celecoxib, or Celebrex), and are also used today to treat pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections, among others.</p><p>Domagk‚Äôs work won him the Nobel Prize in 1935. However, the Nazis, who disapproved of how the Nobel committee tried to help German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, had their Gestapo arrest Domagk for accepting the prize and forced him to give it back. He was able to receive it later in 1947.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-patient-zero-lydia-kang-nate-pederson-workman-publishing-163030051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40a015b5-070e-4d01-856a-05325e42d549</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 16:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137102</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6d0ae90-3d1e-11ec-bbed-dcb96101f5dd" width="6942" height="4628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/91a25190-3d1e-11ec-bfd4-984b39658db5" width="5933" height="2696" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fahroni via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Colorful capsule pills in plastic box.

On Friday, the company sent an email to current subscribers informing them of the impending change. Starting on December 21st, all Hulu + Live subscriptions will include access to Disney‚Äôs two other streaming platforms. Previously, you could get Hulu + Live TV on its own.</p><p>And with the change, the price of Hulu + Live TV plans is increasing by $5 per month for both current and new customers. Come the 21st, the ad-supported tier will cost $69.99 per month, while the ‚Äúno ads‚Äù package will cost $75.99 every 30 days. If you‚Äôre a Hulu + Live TV customer with an existing Disney+ and or ESPN+ subscription, those will roll into the new plan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney previously increased the price of its live TV packages in 2020 when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-live-tv-price-increase-211018162.html"><ins>went up by $10 per month</ins></a>.

In a complaint with the state‚Äôs Superior Court in Alameda County, Jessica Barraza, a production associate with Tesla, said she was subjected to ‚Äúnightmarish‚Äù working conditions over the past three years. Barraza‚Äôs lawsuit describes a factory floor that looks more like ‚Äúa crude, archaic construction site or frat house‚Äù than the site of advanced EV production.</p><p>Barraza‚Äôs allegations against Tesla are numerous. In one incident, the suit alleges a male co-worker stuck his leg between her thighs when she went to punch in after a lunch break. Amid the harassment, Barraza says her complaints fell on deaf ears. In one instance, she says a supervisor did nothing when she complained of a co-worker staring at her breasts. ‚ÄúMaybe you shouldn‚Äôt wear shirts that draw attention to your chest,‚Äù her supervisor told her, according to the suit. Barraza told the man she was ‚Äúwearing a work shirt provided by Tesla.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúAfter almost three years of experiencing all the harassment, it robs your sense of security ‚Äî it almost dehumanizes you,‚Äù Barraza said in an interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/19/tesla-sexual-harassment/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, which was the first outlet to report on the suit. We‚Äôve reached out to Tesla for comment. The company does not typically respond to media requests.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit comes one month after Tesla was ordered by a federal court to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">pay $137 million to a Black employee</a> who said they were subjected to daily racist abuse at its Fremont factory.  ‚ÄúWe continue to grow and improve in how we address employee concerns,‚Äù the company said at the time. ‚ÄúOccasionally, we‚Äôll get it wrong, and when that happens we should be held accountable.‚Äù Tesla is appealing the award.</p><p>Tesla also isn‚Äôt the only EV-maker accused of fostering a toxic workplace for women. Just days before its IPO, Rivian was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">sued by Laura Schwab, one of its former executives</a>. In her lawsuit, Schwab alleges the automaker fired her after she complained of a ‚Äútoxic ‚Äòbro culture‚Äô‚Äù that saw her excluded from meetings and more. ‚ÄúThe culture at Rivian was actually the worst I‚Äôve experienced in over 20 years in the automotive industry,‚Äù Schwab said at the time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-sexual-harassment-suit-185934119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9aca2d5-639f-445a-b833-2c243cb35f2a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 18:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637349236</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T19:13:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bc21a560-496c-11ec-9b6f-a86ec738bd13" width="4804" height="3203" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Tesla vehicle drives past Tesla's primary vehicle factory after CEO Elon Musk announced he was defying local officials' coronavirus disease (COVID-19) restrictions by reopening the plant in Fremont, California, U.S. May 11, 2020.

The last decade-plus has seen Apple‚Äôs computers become essentially impossible for users to service or upgrade, and the iPhone has always been a locked box. Adventurous owners might follow <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+13+Pro+Teardown/144928">guides from iFixit</a> to try and do repairs themselves, but it‚Äôs a dangerous proposition. Remember, it was just earlier this year, when we discovered that replacing the display on an iPhone 13 would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-face-id-third-party-replacement-215624361.html">disable Face ID</a>. (Apple later backpedaled on this.)</p><p>So Apple‚Äôs announcement earlier this week that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">start selling parts and tools directly to consumers </a>and offer repair guides was a huge surprise, and a move immediately hailed as a victory by right-to-repair activists. ‚ÄúOne of the most visible opponents to repair access is reversing course,‚Äù <a href="https://mailchi.mp/9af21ee3e564/statement-apple-concedes-to-right-to-repair-movement-reverses-ban-on-selling-parts-to-consumers?e=767d7cbbfe">said Nathan Proctor</a>, a senior Right to Repair campaign director at Public Interest Research Groups (PIRG). ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs move shows that what repair advocates have been asking for was always possible.‚Äù iFixit was similarly pleased, saying that the move is ‚Äúexactly the right thing for Apple to be doing.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both groups caveated their statements by noting a few catches. PIRG says that Apple‚Äôs plans weren‚Äôt as comprehensive as the right-to-repair legislation being discussed in more than two dozen states, while iFixit wants to ‚Äúanalyze the legal terms and test the program‚Äù before it can say just how much credit Apple deserves. But regardless, it‚Äôs still a major about-face. So what led Apple to this move?</p><p>Proctor told Engadget in an email exchange that he thinks ‚Äúcombined pressure from consumers, regulators and shareholders has shifted Apple&#39;s thinking.‚Äù But he was also quick to point out that there was pressure coming from inside Apple itself. ‚ÄúWe saw from <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/43008/apple-emails-reveal-internal-debate-on-right-to-repair">some leaked emails</a> from 2019 that many inside Apple never wanted to be hostile to repair in the ways that Apple has been at times,‚Äù he said. You probably saw that [Apple co-founder Steve] Wozniak called [out] the practices, but leaked emails show internal concern they were doing the wrong thing.‚Äù</p><p>Apple has made some other movies recently that show that potential government scrutiny and oversight could be driving change at the company. In 2020, Apple finally let users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">set different browser and email apps</a> as default on the iPhone and iPad, and Siri has gotten smarter about learning your preferences for different music apps when you ask it to play tunes.</p><p>While it‚Äôs likely that Apple is thinking about government pressure, this change might also simply be part of the company listening to its users and correcting some mistakes it made over the last five years or so. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">Take the new MacBook Pro</a>, perhaps the biggest ‚Äúmea culpa‚Äù Apple has ever offered: The company reversed its trend of pursuing thin and light design at all costs and instead actually made the both the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros thicker and heavier than their predecessors. The company also added back ports it had previously removed, killed the unpopular Touch Bar, and generally made a laptop that made it seem like they were listening to consumer feedback. The same could be said for its new home repair program.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/413d2f90-ca89-11e9-a1be-2ec8d17a9f7d" alt="A worker refurbishes an Apple Iphone cell phone at a workshop of the Oxflo company, specialised in refurbishment of broken European smartphones which will be resold and provided with a warranty as part of an eco-responsible approach, in Lusignac, France, June 20, 2019. REUTERS/ Regis Duvignau" data-uuid="a3bb151b-d2db-3e0d-bd23-83ba5e5d2857"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Regis Duvignau / Reuters</div></figure><p>Apple‚Äôs move this week can also be seen as an extension of a program the company launched last year, when it started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-verifies-mac-repair-shops-144422765.html">providing parts and training to third-party repair shops</a> that met Apple‚Äôs qualifications. Obviously, this isn‚Äôt the same as making it easy for anyone to do repairs, but opening up access means the repair landscape for Apple products has changed significantly in the last few years.</p><p>However big of a change this new plan is, though, Proctor and PIRG see this as a first step, something Apple will need to keep up and expand to really deliver what right-to-repair activists think consumers deserve. ‚ÄúI think Right to Repair knows what it wants, and it will be really hard to convince us to settle for anything less than an open market for repair,‚Äù Proctor said. ‚ÄúIf they had done this step years ago, maybe we would have to settle, but we have the momentum, and we are going to empower repair as much as we can. I think most legislators agree: This is just one company and a limited program. The floor got raised, but we aren&#39;t near the ceiling yet.‚Äù</p><p>iFixit has a similar view on the situation. ‚Äú[Apple] pioneered glued-in batteries and proprietary screws, and now they are taking the first steps on a path back to long-lasting, repairable products. iFixit believes that a sustainable, repairable world of technology is possible, and hope that Apple follows up on this commitment to improve their repairability.‚Äù</p><p>As for what‚Äôs to come, it sounds like Apple is committed to making this just a first step. The company said that repair options would initially focus on commonly-repaired modules in the iPhone 12 and 13, like the screen, battery and cameras, but it says that more options will come in the following year. We don‚Äôt know if Apple will ever give right-to-repair activists everything they want. It seems unlikely that Apple will make an iPhone where you can just pop it open and drop a new battery in, like the phones of old.</p><p>Apple can often be a bellwether for the rest of the industry ‚Äî just look how quickly other phone-makers dropped their headphone jacks. So, it‚Äôs possible we‚Äôll see some other big consumer electronics companies make similar moves. ‚ÄúI think other companies will follow,‚Äù Proctor said. He also noted that Google had just released software that lets a replacement display on the Pixel 6 be properly calibrated to work with the in-screen fingerprint sensor.‚Äù We see a lot of changes in the works, and we are hopeful we can set a new baseline [for] access to repair.‚Äù If that happens, we‚Äôll likely remember Apple‚Äôs about-face as a catalyst for these changes ‚Äî assuming the company follows through with its new stance and makes it easier for owners to repair a wider variety of its products.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65b293b6-1e20-431e-88d8-a50d492b2a25</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637354117</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T20:35:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/325bd980-4959-11ec-bfd2-888ffdd2c055" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/325bd980-4959-11ec-bfd2-888ffdd2c055" width="1600" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Why Apple changed its mind on Right to Repair]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus 9 Pro is $270 off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re looking for an alternative smartphone to an iPhone, Samsung handset or Pixel, you can&#39;t go far wrong with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9 Pro</a>.
