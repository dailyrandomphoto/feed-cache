Dochterman, who worked with Wise on the 2001 DVD version, will all return to work on the 4K spruce up.</p><p><em>The Motion Picture</em> (<em>TMP</em>)’s fraught production meant that the film was barely finished before it premiered, with Wise carrying the print himself to the premiere. Wise had said that the film was “unfinished,” and despite a healthy box office, took a pasting from critics who deemed it to be too slow and talky. At the dawn of the DVD era, Wise, Fein, Matessino and Dochterman collaborated on a re-edit of the film that better showed off Wise’s original vision. This included remastered visual effects and a remastered and re-edited score by Jerry Goldsmith. The effects for the 2001 version were produced by CGI pioneers Foundation Imaging, which was Star Trek’s (then) contractor for all computer generated work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="79819b7fd7064a83ae3367637e916e2a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbgqsaBZHUQ?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>(After its theatrical run, ABC broadcast a “Special Longer Version” of the film that is notorious for including extra scenes with clearly unfinished effects. The most obvious of which is the start of Kirk’s EVA, where the airlock set is surrounded by <a href="https://movies.trekcore.com/gallery/displayimage.php?album=270&amp;pid=29519#top_display_media">studio scaffolding</a>, intended to be replaced by a matte painting.)</p><p>It was a well-held myth in fan circles that a 4K version of the <em>Director’s Edition</em> was impossible because the CGI assets and film footage had been scanned and edited for standard definition. The bankruptcy of Foundation Imaging, which took place shortly after the film was released, also dashed hopes for any higher-definition re-releases. However, as <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture#December_1977_.E2.80.93_December_1979:_Star_Trek:_The_Motion_Picture">Memory Alpha</a> lists, producer David C. Fein confirmed in 2017 that the digital material necessary to facilitate a 4K remastering still exists.</p><p>Given how<em> TMP’s</em> reputation has been slowly rehabilitated over the last three decades, a 4K version of the film is very welcome. If only because, as well as a smart and interesting vision of the future, the model work and score are so good that they deserve to be seen in the best possible resolution. We can’t wait to experience this in 4K when it arrives at some point between December and next March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-motion-picture-directors-edition-4k-remaster-paramount-plus-154117182.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">235684c6-b85f-4927-b7d2-75661fcbf293</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:41:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625758917</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T15:42:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92176d10-e001-11eb-bb6b-1881eff87f0d" width="4350" height="3073" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Ochs Archives via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DECEMBER 7:  Actors Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and William Shatner pose for a portrait with writer Gene Roddenberry and  director Robert Wise during the filming of the movie "Star Trek: The Motion Picture" which was released December 27, 1979 in the United States.

Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program (which is a bit like Microsoft&#39;s Windows Insider early-access scheme), it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>The snappily named Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders harnesses Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Snapdragon 888 5G chipset</a> (but not the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a>). It has a 2.84 GHz octa-core processor and the Adreno 660 GPU. It has what Qualcomm describes as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E support with speeds of up to 3.6 Gbps. You&#39;ll get 16GB of LPDDR5 memory and 512GB of storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 6.78-inch AMOLED display from Samsung has a 144 Hz refresh rate, which could help make it a solid gaming phone. The screen has up to 1,200 nits of brightness and it&#39;s HDR10 and HDR10+ certified. The phone has three rear cameras: a 64MP main lens, 12MP ultrawide camera and 8MP telephoto. The array can capture video in up to 8K. The device also has a 24MP front camera and AI auto-zoom.</p><p>Qualcomm says this is one of the first phones to support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-wireless-audio-quality-160036734.html">Snapdragon Sound</a>, which has features including low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz. Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds and a charging case for them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/96deec00-df58-11eb-a7e2-a4745dcb8aa8" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="56dfe2ba-28f9-3103-8794-86ec75b4175d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure><p>There&#39;s also Qualcomm Quick Charge 5 support, which should charge the 4000mAh battery up to 70 percent of capacity in half an hour or fully in 52 minutes, according to the company. In addition, the phone has dual SIM slots and it runs on stock <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2011">Android 11</a>.</p><p>The device draws from previous ASUS smartphones. It pulls from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG Phone 5&#39;s body design</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenfone-8-compact-flagship-flip-camera-price-availability-182205867.html">ZenFone 8 Flip&#39;s camera module</a>. Still, it&#39;s a showcase for Qualcomm&#39;s mobile tech. The company is facing some challenges on the mobile processor front, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-5g-iphone-chips-2023-kuo-080605379.html">many phone makers</a> working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">their own chips</a>. Showing off its knowhow with its own smartphone seems like a solid idea for Qualcomm. That way, it can perhaps remind people what it can do.</p><p>The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It&#39;ll arrive in India later. You&#39;ll be able to buy the $1,499 device at ASUSTeK’s eShop and other retailers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d079e9f-9ac1-4f23-a299-1ab2d2a46a68</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625763024</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T16:50:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Qualcomm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter's extended NFL deal adds live Spaces chats with players]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has once again renewed its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-30-twitter-expanded-programming-nfl-blizzcon.html">deal with the NFL</a>, and this time there&#39;s more than just video shows and Moments to keep football fans happy.

The two, along with whistleblower Daimler, supposedly agreed to avoid competing on emissions-reducing AdBlue urea injection tech in discussions held between 2009 and 2014.</p><p>BMW, Daimler and VW reached a deal on AdBlue tank sizes, ranges, and average consumption, and even shared &quot;sensitive&quot; technical details with each other, the Commission claimed. This reportedly halted competition and stopped the trio from realizing the &quot;full potential&quot; of their emissions-reducing tech. They might have cleaned diesel output beyond EU requirements, but apparently chose not to.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All three have agreed to settle the case. Daimler had been facing a €727 million ($861.5 million) fine if it hadn&#39;t disclosed the behavior.

To that end, officials offered guidance on cooperation that wouldn&#39;t run afoul of antitrust rules, such as developing a unified AdBlue software system.</p><p>That pioneering conclusion might cause problems, however. VW said in a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volkswagen-weighs-appeal-against-eu-fine-over-emissions-tech-collusion-2021-07-08/">statement</a> that it was considering a possible appeal against the fine for allegedly setting a dangerous precedent in unfamiliar territory. The automaker also maintained that the substance of the discussions was &quot;never implemented&quot; and that customers never suffered as a consequence. It&#39;s not certain VW would succeed with an appeal, but the fight could be far from over.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eu-fines-bmw-vw-over-diesel-emissions-tech-132924021.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b1533e3-5928-453f-80ff-dfd03a997f25</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 13:29:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625750967</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T13:29:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5166f240-dfe8-11eb-a1fe-8114df448292" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sean Gallup via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WOLFSBURG, GERMANY - OCTOBER 26: The Volkswagen logo is reflected in the window and body of a Volkswagen ID.3 electric car standingt on display at the Autostadt promotional facility next to the Volkswagen factory on October 26, 2020 in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Because my twins were NICU graduates, there was no question that we wanted a monitor at home that could reproduce the stats we were used to seeing in the hospital. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Owlet;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet&#x002019;s smart sock" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Owlet’s smart sock</a> is the only infant wearable that measures heart rate, pulse ox and breathing rate. That information is displayed in an app that graphs your child’s data and tracks their sleep patterns as well. If your child’s readings rise or dip outside normal levels, you’ll be alerted through an alarm on your phone and the Owlet base station.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ve used both the second- and third-generation sock for the twins until they hit the weight limit. Strapping the sock onto a wriggly baby is not always easy, and a poor fit can cause heart-stopping false alerts. However, checking the Owlet’s readings frequently in those early days was reassuring to me, and over time I felt more comfortable as I got a sense for their typical stats. The sock measurements also helped me understand their sleep habits by reporting back on when they were sleeping and when they were very much not sleeping. The amount of information and support was especially helpful when I found myself worrying, as I could simply pull up their data on the app for reassurance. Additionally, Owlet makes a camera that can tie into the system to provide video and audio feeds and sound/motion alerts, so you can get a quick peek at your little one.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Owlet;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy smart sock at Owlet - $299" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">Buy smart sock at Owlet - $299</a></p><h2>Nanit Pro baby monitor</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b068f670-df62-11eb-9b5d-837409d12b3e" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Nanit Pro baby monitor" data-uuid="40b65531-8edd-3177-bfa5-cf1821c4319f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nanit</div></figure><p>Once you finally get your newborn to sleep, you’re going to want to check on them roughly every two and a half minutes until you pass out on the couch watching Hulu. Regardless, there is no bigger transgression than waking a sleeping baby, so you’ll need a quality monitor to help keep tabs on your new addition without disturbing them. There are a lot of good monitors on the market, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nanit" href="https://amzn.to/3pGI7rw">Nanit</a> became a favorite thanks to its clear video and extensive features. The Nanit camera offers a bird’s-eye view of your child’s crib, and because it’s positioned over the crib you won’t need to worry about adjusting the angle. It needs to be either wall mounted or set up on its stand, but  I found the latter setup wobbly and fragile, so I’d recommend the stand, for sure.</p><p>The 1080p video stream is clear, day and night, and it can be shared with multiple caretakers. Nanit is tied to an app so you’ll access the feed from your phone; there’s no need to charge or keep track of a separate display. It also offers noise and sound alerts, which made it easy to get a heads-up when one of the twins was stirring, though I had to minimize the sensitivity of these in the app because they occurred frequently. It collects snippets of your child’s night time activities for your reference, and tracks sleep data. Nanit also offers a Breathing Band wearable if you’d also like to track your baby’s breaths per minute.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Nanit Pro at Amazon - $300" href="https://amzn.to/3pGI7rw">Buy Nanit Pro at Amazon - $300</a></p><h2>Munchkin 59s pacifier sterilizer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/40ba2730-df63-11eb-8d53-555b6734a16d" style="height:1025;width:1500;" alt="Munchkin pacifier cleaner " data-uuid="226069fb-3ce9-3cf2-bfdd-bc3c706cbb22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Munchkin</div></figure><p>It wasn’t until I had babies that I realized how completely filthy everything in my home was. Although I have used the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wabi steam sanitizer" href="https://amzn.to/3ix9D9b">Wabi steam sanitizer</a> for the last year or so in order to deep clean the majority of the kids’ cutlery, bottles and cups, it’s overkill to haul that thing out for pacifiers alone. Munchkin makes a cute <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:4.1 ounce UV-C cube" href="https://amzn.to/3cAnuYy">4.1 ounce UV-C cube</a> that can sterilize a single pacifier in under a minute. It’s straightforward to use and easy to tote around, thanks to the silicone wrist strap.</p><p>You’ll have to first wipe down any pacifiers that are covered in hair, crumbs or other toddler detritus, but after that all you need to do is pop the binky into the cube and hit the button. The 59S lights up in a blue hue that fascinates my kids while it kills 99 percent of household germs — and that may include coronavirus, which the FDA says <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-covid-19-and-medical-devices/uv-lights-and-lamps-ultraviolet-c-radiation-disinfection-and-coronavirus">could be</a> rendered inactive from the UV-C. The combination of pacifier wipes and the 59S came in handy during a recent trip where my kids were in a variety of different environments; I didn’t have to worry at all knowing that I could quickly cleanse their pacifiers without having to run to a sink every time they threw a binky on the ground, outside their sleeping area, into a pool or directly into someone’s cup of coffee.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Munchkin 59s sterilizer at Amazon - $20" href="https://amzn.to/3cAnuYy">Buy Munchkin 59s sterilizer at Amazon - $20</a></p><h2>Willow wearable breast pump</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/301ff850-df63-11eb-bef7-049c6979ddad" style="height:1531;width:2000;" alt="Willow breast pump" data-uuid="666c1cb6-5e87-39ec-9ec3-695af1e037ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Willow</div></figure><p>Establishing a pumping and breastfeeding routine is an exhausting challenge, so any shortcuts that save you time or energy are basically essential. Wearing a breast pump instead of being tethered to my Spectra was a tremendous relief. I could pump while doing laundry, working, soothing a cranky baby or even practicing yoga. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Willow" href="https://amzn.to/3iBNZAL">Willow</a> makes wearable breast pumps that are spill-proof (I tested it in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/willow-30-versus-elvie-smart-breast-pump-review-140030444.html">downward dog</a>) and comfortable to use. However, they weigh 12.5 ounces each and I felt pretty self-conscious wearing them around because they made my silhouette look like an exaggerated comic book character.</p><p>Willow’s system contains all the parts in an egg-shaped pump that you slip into a bra. The wearer can control intensity either on the pump itself or via the smartphone app, which also tracks a session and how much you’ve pumped. I particularly like that Willow gives users two options for milk collection: a reusable container or a disposable bag, though only the bag option is spill-proof. It’s fairly quiet but I still skipped wearing it outside for longer than it took to grab the mail. Although the Bluetooth connection to the app was inconsistent, it didn’t hinder my ability to use the hardware — or my gratitude in being able to move freely while pumping.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Willow breast pump at Amazon - $500" href="https://amzn.to/3iBNZAL">Buy Willow breast pump at Amazon - $500</a></p><h2>Hatch Rest+</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8ae1de80-a83a-11eb-aed3-01be4ca15df3" style="height:1000;width:1500;" alt="Hatch Rest+" data-uuid="b94901be-cd31-3e42-a5b2-643bceba0998"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hatch</div></figure><p>My love for the Hatch Rest is well established; I’ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-white-noise-machines-for-babies-140053157.html">written</a> multiple times how I use it daily, and how it’s been useful as a night light, white noise machine and sleep trainer. I’ve recommended it to friends and I even packed it when my family was being <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hatch-baby-rest-gadget-irl-123051499.html">evacuated</a> from a forest fire. In case you missed those previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-gifts-for-new-moms-123052827.html">references</a>, here’s the scoop: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hatch Rest" href="https://amzn.to/3gsvYSC">Hatch Rest</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rest+" href="https://amzn.to/3gnDm1V">Rest+</a> are minimally designed, fully-functional smart home devices that can be programmed to play a variety of sounds and colors. There are 10 available colors, or you can create a custom one, and 11 sounds including rain storms and lullabies. You can control it either from your phone or from the physical buttons and touch ring on the device itself.</p><p>The Rest+ is more expensive at $90 but brings a few additional features like battery power, two-way audio, a dimmable clock, voice control with Alexa, and access for multiple users. If you can do without those, the $60 Rest should suffice. Hatch also makes an adult model, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Restore" href="https://amzn.to/2V8JJPv">Restore</a>, and recently released the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Rest Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3jM9vU7">Rest Mini</a>, which offers a subscription to stories, lullabies and more kid-friendly content.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Hatch Rest at Amazon - $60" href="https://amzn.to/3gsvYSC">Buy Hatch Rest at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Hatch Rest+ at Amazon - $90" href="https://amzn.to/3gnDm1V">Buy Hatch Rest+ at Amazon - $90</a></p><h2>4moms mamaroo4 infant seat</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/581a5850-df63-11eb-9efc-756c92eefc00" style="height:1280;width:1500;" alt="4moms mamaroo4 infant seat" data-uuid="96e39684-585b-34f5-96fa-0a3aea26665c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">4moms</div></figure><p>An infant swing can be helpful to entertain your babe while you do other tasks or to help them gently fall asleep while being gently rocked. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:4moms mamaroo4" href="https://amzn.to/2TmGKSU">4moms mamaroo4</a> is a smart swing that not only mimics the actions that parents use when soothing babies, but can also be fully controlled from your phone. It is also blessedly simple to set up; the instructions are well-explained and I was able to get the whole thing up and running in under 10 minutes while my twins were distracted with teething crackers and <a href="https://amzn.to/3k1HyrF">Flappy the Elephant</a>. It offers five movement options (car ride, kangaroo, rock a bye, tree swing and wave), five speed options and four built-in sounds (rain, fan, ocean, heart). You can also connect an MP3 player to it to play your own lullabies and tunes.</p><p>The speakers on the mamaRoo4 aren’t exactly bangers, though, so if you connect an MP3 player or streaming device don’t expect it to sound amazing. It will do the job for kid’s lullabies or classical tracks, but it doesn’t get very loud and isn’t built to be a speaker system. The swing itself isn’t exactly silent as it moves either, though in no way is it annoying or distracting. It does muffle the built-in sounds a bit so it’s hard to distinguish between them. The swings movements seem subtle at times, but my daughter seemed to enjoy them. It is pricier than most standard swings and will work up to six months or 25 pounds, but it might be worth it to be able to start, pause, change movement all from your phone as your baby settles down.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy mamaroo4 at Amazon - $250" href="https://amzn.to/2TmGKSU">Buy mamaroo4 at Amazon - $250</a></p><h2>Withings Thermo smart thermometer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e42e5490-df63-11eb-9cfd-4077f1625f5e" style="height:991;width:1500;" alt="Withings Thermo Smart Temporal Thermometer" data-uuid="ab327d9d-c7ea-3a22-8f64-97dcd742fa9d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Do you really need a $100 smart thermometer for your new baby? Technically, no. But y’all, let me tell you it only took a single use of the Withings Thermo to win me over. Here’s why: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Withing&#x002019;s smart temporal thermometer" href="https://amzn.to/2SqENV5">Withing’s smart temporal thermometer</a> uses an artery in the head to measure temperatures. Which means instead of trying to keep a standard thermometer correctly positioned in the armpit of a wriggly, crying infant for an interminable time to get a reading you hope is accurate, all you have to do is gently swipe the Thermo wand across their forehead. You don’t even have to make direct contact with the skin since Thermo can still measure when held a half-inch away. It’s easy enough that I found myself taking my kid’s temperature more regularly because it was no longer a fight.</p><p>Thermo then displays the result on the LED display (which, for what it’s worth, really intrigued my twins) and you can press a button to save the reading. Because it’s tied to an app, Thermo not only saves previous readings so you can track temps, but it also lets you add multiple family members and assign a temperature to the correct individual. As a mom of twins, that’s the feature I was most interested in and it was simple and easy to scroll through profiles using a swipe next to the display. The app also helps you get Thermo set up. I will admit it took two attempts before I could complete this process but it wasn’t complicated; it just initially seemed to get stuck on the setup screen. Also, it’s worth noting that the Thermo started to take temperatures immediately, so I had a few results come in just as I was holding it in my hand and pointing it at a wall but these ambient readings are easy to dismiss.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Withings Thermo at Amazon - $99" href="https://amzn.to/2SqENV5">Buy Withings Thermo at Amazon - $99</a></p><h2>Baby Brezza Safe + Smart bottle warmer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/9fce5080-a83a-11eb-bfeb-5e1c9d26ad99" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Baby Brezza smart bottle warmer" data-uuid="655b48dd-cd4a-3c7f-ac00-65d451329e0d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Baby Brezza</div></figure><p>A good bottle warmer should be efficient, minimal and easy to clean. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Baby Brezza&#x002019;s version" href="https://amzn.to/3hE5bU3">Baby Brezza’s version</a> is a good option because it has a slim profile, which makes it convenient to stash on a countertop, along with intuitive buttons and controls. It can heat either formula or breast milk using two warming settings (a steady warm water bath or a quick steam warm), as well as defrost frozen milk. The bottle tray fits most types, too — I can confirm it worked fine with the three different types that I had in my house. I was able to figure out how to work it without consulting the instructions too much, and I was pleased at how the bottles came out at an ideal temperature.</p><p>However, the noteworthy feature of the Safe + Smart is the Bluetooth connection that allows the warmer to be controlled through an app on your phone. You can select things like warming speed and the bottle’s starting temperature before starting a warming session all from within the app. It will also alert you when the bottle is ready to go.</p><p>While it sounds like a niche device, it proved particularly useful in certain situations. I was able to prepare a bottle, start my kid’s baths and use the app to start warming a bottle so it would be ready right as they were. I could also start a bottle, then text my partner to bring it upstairs as I read bedtime stories. And the alarm meant I could avoid walking up and down stairs several times to check on the warmer as I usually do. It’s a neat feature, but because you’ll still need to add water to the warmer each time, it works best if you plan ahead to use it.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Baby Brezza bottle warmer at Amazon - $70" href="https://amzn.to/3hE5bU3">Buy Baby Brezza bottle warmer at Amazon - $70</a></p><h2>Toys</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2495630-df63-11eb-b0fb-09965d7305c0" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Skip Hop Bandana Buddies Elephant" data-uuid="2a838fdc-38c6-3419-9e16-ce4f558757d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skip Hop Bandana Buddies</div></figure><p>Infants experience the world around them through their senses, so they’ll be drawn to toys with a lot of colors, sounds and textures. Look for toys they can grab, twist, crinkle, chew, shake and spin. For example, this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:activity ball" href="https://amzn.to/3x7lkHG">activity ball</a> is ideal because it has several interactive elements: a mirror, a spinning ball, beads in a tube and a squeaky button, among others. My kids really enjoyed exploring each element here as their skills progressed. Sensory soft toys like this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:elephant" href="https://amzn.to/2UyWh2c">elephant</a> reproduce a similar experience with rattles, gum massagers, pockets and rings, and are easy to hang in a car seat as well.

The most important feature of the Bites 2 Lite is its price. At $125, it costs half as much as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-petcubes-bites-2-and-play-2-hands-on.html">predecessor did at launch</a>. Naturally, that means some compromises. What you won’t find on the Bites 2 Lite is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-petcube-bites-2-play-2-alexa.html">Alexa</a>. Amazon’s voice-activated assistant made the Bites 2 into more than just a treat dispenser and home camera. You could also use it as a smart speaker with all the usual functionality that comes with an Echo device. It also came with a Petcube-specific Alexa skill that allowed you to sling treats at your pet.</p><div id="02f4b92dbed0485fabd2bc7a98c22b75"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PJ-seNwO4xY?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Other compromises include a camera with a narrower 160-degree field-of-view and no support for 5GHz WiFi connectivity. On that front, the Bites 2 Lite limits you to a slower 2.4GHz connection. Beyond those missing features, there aren’t a lot of meaningful differences between Petcube’s newest device and its predecessor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/29fa1a90-df4b-11eb-bbce-531e1dabbccc" alt="Petcube Bites 2 Lite" data-uuid="3862afd1-496b-3aec-944b-5c43d633bf2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Petcube</div></figure><p>It comes with a 1080p camera that features automatic night vision and 8x digital zoom.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hyrope" href="https://fave.co/3jWqova">Hyrope</a> can pair with the company&#39;s official app to track the user&#39;s jump count, speed, pace and calorie burn as they go along. Hygear&#39;s app picks the interactive workouts they can follow based on their fitness goals and uses AI tech to adjust them based on actual performance.</p><p>While gyms have started <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-gym-is-open-but-everythings-different-11615887001">reopening</a> in recent months after coronavirus restrictions loosened up, some may still choose to continue exercising in their homes. A lot of people purchased expensive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-corporate-wellness-134436951.html">machines</a> in the middle of the pandemic last year, after all, and may have gotten used to following video workouts from the growing number of digital fitness subscriptions out there. Hyrope may have a been a bit late to the game, but it could still find its audience in those who now prefer working out at home, or those who just want a handy exercise tool they can bring anywhere they go.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says it chose to introduce Hyrope, because &quot;because mixing cardio with strength training is one of the best, most effective ways to burn calories for weight loss,&quot; and rope jumping is &quot;excellent cardio activity that can be performed in limited space.&quot; Hyrope is now <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:available for pre-sale" href="https://fave.co/3jWqova">available for pre-sale</a> for $39. It comes with the device itself and a year-long Hygear app membership. The jump rope is launching with a 90-day weight loss program that&#39;s accessible through the app, and the company is also rolling out 45- and 60-day cardio programs in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyrope-hygear-smart-jump-rope-042428375.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e4a2d8a-a529-4963-9545-ef482065f3af</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 04:24:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625745737</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T12:02:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e38c02d0-df9f-11eb-8bc7-e18ce25fd50c" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e38c02d0-df9f-11eb-8bc7-e18ce25fd50c" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BenMizrachi/Hygear]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hygear]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hygear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[36 states launch antitrust suit against Google over the Play Store (update)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has yet another antitrust lawsuit on its hands. <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/07/36-states-dc-sue-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-in-its-android-app-store-498622"><em>Politico</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports 36 states and Washington DC have banded together to sue the company over its handling of the Play Store. They say Google&#39;s control over the marketplace violates US antitrust law. The bipartisan group of attorneys general behind the suit <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/60042641/1/state-of-utah-v-google-llc/">filed the case</a> in the same California federal court where Judge James Donato is scheduled to hire Epic&#39;s suit against Google over <em>Fortnite&#39;s</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-android-225437892.html">removal from the Play Store last year</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This latest action is the fourth antitrust lawsuit launched against Google following three similar claims in 2020. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-third-antitrust-lawsuit-175948359.html">In December</a>, a group of 38 states and territories led by Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed antitrust charges against the company over its search business. The tech giant is also the subject of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-us-justice-department-antitrust-competition-announcement-144344497.html">Department of Justice probe</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The timing of Wednesday&#39;s suit follows after Google recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">lowered</a> its Play Store commission fee to 15 percent on the first $1 million developers earn on the marketplace every year. When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">announced the change back in March</a>, it claimed it would reduce the fees it takes from 99 percent of Android developers by 50 percent. Later this year, Google also plans to enforce a policy that will require all developers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">process their payments through the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>. The announcement led to uproar among companies like Netflix and Spotify that had in the past skirted that requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the Play Store comes preinstalled on the majority of Android devices, it is not the only place where you can download software to your phone. Amazon and Samsung operate their own app stores. It&#39;s also possible to sideload Android apps from websites like APK Mirror, allowing you to bypass the Play Store completely. Both those facts are not true of iOS devices where Apple&#39;s App Store is the only place where you can download software for your iPhone or iPad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today&#39;s suit also comes a little more than a week after a federal judge in Washington <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">dismissed the FTC&#39;s antitrust complaint against Facebook</a>, saying the agency hadn&#39;t presented sufficient evidence to back up its claims that the social media giant is a monopoly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 07/07/21 10:30PM ET: </strong>Colorado has joined the lawsuit against Google, bringing the total number of states to 37. The tech giant has <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/">published</a> a blog post defending its practices, however, calling the lawsuit &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;meritless&quot; for &quot;attacking a system that provides more openness and choice than others.&quot; Google&#39;s Senior Director of Public Policy, Wilson White, concluded the post with this note: &quot;This lawsuit isn&#39;t about helping the little guy or protecting consumers. It&#39;s about boosting a handful of major app developers who want the benefits of Google Play without paying for it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">13888926-80a4-45a3-86b9-6cc3fdde71d1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 21:11:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625714860</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T03:27:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Young / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google CEO Sundar Pichai is sworn in prior to testifying at a House Judiciary Committee hearing “examining Google and its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 11, 2018.

This week, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16794/oneplus-9-performance-examination"><em>AnandTech</em></a> published a report in which it said it found the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-and-9-pro-official-141121859.html">OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9</a> throttle the capabilities of their Snapdragon 888 processors when running popular apps like Chrome, Twitter and WhatsApp. <em>AnandTech</em> wasn&#39;t able to suss out a complete list of all the applications where the two phones limit their CPU output, but what&#39;s notable about the outlet&#39;s findings is that the OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9 don&#39;t throttle any benchmarking tools.</p><div id="30aa934fdbec4d678e538793d61c7767"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s disappointing to see OnePlus handsets making performance decisions based on application identifiers rather than application behavior.

Following the launch of the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro in March, some users told us about some areas where we could improve the devices&#39; battery life and heat management. As a result of this feedback, our R&amp;D team has been working over the past few months to optimize the devices&#39; performance when using many of the most popular apps, including Chrome, by matching the app&#39;s processor requirements with the most appropriate power. This has helped to provide a smooth experience while reducing power consumption. While this may impact the devices&#39; performance in some benchmarking apps, our focus as always is to do what we can to improve the performance of the device for our users.</p></blockquote><p>If you&#39;ve been following OnePlus for a while, you&#39;ll know the company is no stranger to this type of controversy. Back in the days of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-01-oneplus-3t-benchmark-cheating.html">OnePlus 3T</a>, the company included code in OxygenOS that would artificially boost the clock speeds of the phone&#39;s Snapdragon processor when running certain benchmark apps. <em>XDA</em> caught the company doing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5-benchmark-cheating-reviews/">something similar with the OnePlus 5</a>.</p><p>On the face of things, the situation here is different. OnePlus is throttling the OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9 to save on battery life. And while most people won&#39;t notice unless they have another Snapdragon 888 device next to their phone, the company was still mispresenting the capabilities of those devices based on the fact they it throttle benchmarking apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-throttling-200547997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">630dcf7f-1ed7-4b29-b7bb-324dcda8a7ae</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 20:05:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625749334</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T13:02:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/469fea50-df5d-11eb-9fa7-40b26c97f4e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/469fea50-df5d-11eb-9fa7-40b26c97f4e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok tests letting US users to apply for jobs with video resumes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-job-recruitment-tool-report-191359350.html">reports were accurate</a>: TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes">expanding into job recruitment</a>.

The company hopes this vaccine will prove more potent than the current 40 to 60 percent efficacy rate of conventional flu vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We are pleased to have begun this Phase 1/2 study of mRNA-1010, our first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine candidate to enter the clinic. We expect that our seasonal influenza vaccine candidates will be an important component of our future combination respiratory vaccines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said. “Respiratory combination vaccines are an important pillar of our overall mRNA vaccine strategy. We believe that the advantages of mRNA vaccines include the ability to combine different antigens to protect against multiple viruses and the ability to rapidly respond to the evolution of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses.&quot;</p><p>This vaccine has been generated using the same genomic techniques the company utilized to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-vaccine-research-and-development-150052906.html">develop its COVID-19 treatment in 2020</a>. The technique works by exploiting the human body&#39;s own cells to reproduce snippets of viral DNA to instigate an immune response and prime the body against future infection. Since this method doesn&#39;t require the entire virus (either weakened or dead) but rather just a birt of its genetic code, mRNA vaccines could be applied to any number of deadly modern diseases including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mrna-tech-we-used-against-covid-could-help-us-finally-beat-malaria-153045965.html">malaria, TB — even cancer</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moderna-submits-its-m-rna-based-flu-vaccine-for-clinical-trials-172548543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">358fdb8b-5098-412b-92a4-48714f431ece</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 17:25:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681450</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Infectious Diseases]]></category><category><![CDATA[Epidemic & Plague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Medical syringes in the mini shopping trolley are seen in front of the Moderna logo displayed on a screen.

But it’s not quite the upgrade we were expecting. For months, reports claimed a “Switch Pro” would also deliver some sort of 4K upscaling capability and faster performance. But this new model, which will sell for $350 when it’s released on October 8th, doesn’t go nearly that far. Instead, it’s more of a minor step forward that fixes a few of the Switch’s original design flaws, but doesn’t dramatically change the system. And you know what? That’s fine.</p><p>If you’ve been following Nintendo for any amount of time, it shouldn’t be surprising that the company isn’t really interested in joining a spcs race. Let Sony and Microsoft duke it out for 4K dominance — Nintendo can show there’s still plenty to love about games in 1080p and below. Sticking with the same hardware also means developers don’t have to worry about splitting the Switch user base, an issue that’s plagued Nintendo systems over the last few decades. (Was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds.html">New 3DS</a> actually worth it?)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">global chip shortage</a> may have foiled Nintendo’s plans to stuff better hardware in this Switch, as well. The system currently uses a custom version of NVIDIA’s Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-nintendo-switch-upgraded-battery-life.html">quietly updated in 2019</a> to increase the console’s battery life. According to various reports, Nintendo was exploring docked 4K upscaling using NVIDIA’s DLSS technology, which uses AI processing to bump lower-resolution textures up to something that looks far sharper. But that technology would have required an updated Tegra chip that brought over some of the hardware from NVIDIA’s recent RTX GPUs. That’s not an impossible task, but it’s one that may have required more work than NVIDIA was able to accomplish during the hellscape of 2020 (at least, while keeping the final cost reasonable).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0370e9b0-df3e-11eb-bec7-1c955b9d7f3d" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="7be3a59e-e8e7-35a0-9937-6d314a89ca4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>That doesn’t mean dreams of a 4K-capable Switch are dead; it’s just something we’ll have to wait a year or two to see. Nintendo would also need to add more RAM to the Switch so it could better handle the 1080p textures required for DLSS upscaling. That’s not easy to do with the system’s meager 4GB of RAM, so a future console would need 6GB or 8GB. And don’t forget, Nintendo also needs to balance delivering solid battery life with the Switch in handheld mode, so it needs to be careful about shoving in demanding new hardware.</p><p>For owners of the original Switch, or newcomers to the platform, this OLED model still seems like an enticing upgrade. The larger screen makes the system look more modern, with less of a chunky display bezel. OLED will also make games look dramatically better, especially while playing outside in direct sunlight. There’s also a wider kickstand, similar to the one of the Microsoft Surface tablets, which should make portable play a lot more stable. There’s also 64GB of internal storage, up from 32GB, and “enhanced audio,” which could just refer to better speakers. Nintendo isn’t getting very specific there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/03704d70-df3e-11eb-bddf-b215b32ed725" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="5007a9b5-8a73-3c44-bdfa-5f8e6622cc14"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>And if you’re really into online multiplayer, you’ll likely appreciate the Ethernet port built into the OLED Switch’s dock. (And if that’s the main draw for you, Nintendo says the dock is also compatible with the old Switch models.) Due to the larger screen, though, Nintendo says the OLED Switch may run into issues with some Labo kits and other games.</p><p>I get it, $350 is a lot to shell out for a slightly better Switch. That’s particularly true when you can get the disc-less PlayStation 5 for $399, or the full PS5 and Xbox Series X for $499. But for Nintendo diehards, the improvements are definitely tempting. Just don’t be surprised if the company ends up dropping the 4K-capable Switch during the 2022 holiday season.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-oled-switch-not-switch-pro-161744624.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97cc4a00-f020-47fd-a967-9f76ef814ff9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 16:17:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681630</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bungie will reveal what's next for 'Destiny 2' on August 24th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Destiny%202"><em><ins>Destiny 2</ins></em></a> fans will soon find out more about the future of the game.

Trump announced the legal bid at a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, promising the case would lead to an &quot;end of the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and the canceling that you know so well.&quot; Trump and his lawyers, many of whom he said come from the tobacco industry, plan to file the lawsuits in the Southern District of Florida and hope to obtain class action status with each one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Trump alleges the tech giants violated his First Amendment rights and even calls Facebook a &quot;state actor&quot; in one of the suits.

The decision to file the suits in Florida may prove an early roadblock for Trump. As noted by <a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1412795910430527489?s=20"><em>Reuters</em></a>, both the Facebook and Twitter note in their terms of service that any case brought against them must done so at select courts in California.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Following the January 6th US Capitol riot, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html">Facebook</a> suspended Trump from their respective platforms. &quot;We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,&quot; Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at the time. The action comes more than two months after Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board said the company&#39;s suspension of the former president was &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">appropriate</a>.&quot; Facebook currently plans to uphold the ban until at least January 2023.
