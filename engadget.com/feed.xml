According to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"><em>XDA-Developers</em></a>, the foldable device shows a warning when you attempt to unlock its bootloader, telling you that doing so &quot;will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phones and apps to stop working correctly.&quot; Indeed, that&#39;s exactly what happens when you do go through with the process to gain root access and modify the device&#39;s software.</p><p>After unlocking the bootloader, you&#39;ll notice that the stock camera app will fail to operate. You&#39;ll no longer be able to fire it up to take photos, and the apps on your phone that use the camera won&#39;t be able to access it, as well. Those apps — yes, including third-party camera apps — just remain dark or time out after a while, so there&#39;s no workaround. In fact, all camera-related features will cease to function, including facial recognition.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Samsung for a statement and were told that the company has nothing to share right now. As the publication notes, Samsung has always made it difficult to root its phones: Modifying the device&#39;s software already voids your warranty and kills Samsung Pay. This is next level protection, though — and perhaps a most effective one — considering most people at this point in time frequently use their phones as cameras. <em>XDA</em> says re-locking the bootloader will also re-enable the Galaxy Fold 3&#39;s camera, so all won&#39;t be lost if you do decide to try it out and poke around for a solution yourself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-disables-galaxy-z-fold-3-camera-unlock-bootloader-044518459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6467bb73-c545-4914-b0b4-6b479a089e12</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 04:45:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629866731</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T04:45:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d1bd9d0-0558-11ec-babf-42ae6a6c05ce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d1bd9d0-0558-11ec-babf-42ae6a6c05ce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California expands Activision Blizzard lawsuit to include temporary workers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has expanded the scope of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard to include temporary workers.

According to the agency, only 20 percent of all employees at the studio are women, and they’re consistently paid less, overlooked for promotions and fired faster than their male counterparts.

So, to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, my favorite console of all time, which arrived in the US on August 23rd, 1991, I wish you many happy returns.</p><p>The SNES wasn’t my first console. Like many kids of the ‘80s, I started with the venerable NES. But that system never quite felt like mine. I played it at friends’ houses for years before my parents relented and got me one for Christmas in 1989. While I don’t want to downplay my excitement, I had already played many of the platform’s classic games. So while it was a huge deal to have my own NES, I wasn’t exactly coming to it fresh.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But the Super NES, that console was <em>mine</em>. I didn’t get it on launch day, but I had been eagerly devouring details about it in <em>Nintendo Power</em>.&nbsp;I started saving my allowance, doing extra chores and monitoring weekly sales flyers for price drops. Finally, at some point in 1992, I brought it home – the console, two outstanding controllers whose design has stood the test of time and <em>Super Mario World</em>. (Remember how generous game companies used to be with the pack-ins?)</p><div id="c4c44020b2834fed9f1122573bc6cb75"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On this day 30 years ago, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America! What are some of your favorite <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNES?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SNES</a> games and memories? <a href="https://t.co/NjpZqPi9U9">pic.twitter.com/NjpZqPi9U9</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1429820774907584512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Obviously, one does not buy a console to ogle the hardware. It’s all about the games, and <em>Super Mario World</em> was an outstanding introduction to the system. I was plenty familiar with Mario at this point, but the sheer scope this time around was stunning. Individual levels were massive and crammed with secrets, and you could re-enter and play them again for the first time to find everything. New additions like Yoshi and the cape power-up offered new ways to navigate and explore these levels.</p><p>And, of course, the game both looked and sounded fantastic. <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> pushed the NES about as far as it could go, but <em>Super Mario World</em> underscored how much more capable the new system was. Mario and some familiar enemies looked more vibrant and detailed than ever, and the system’s power was also evident in those sprawling levels and environments. It was the first Mario game with a save feature, and with good reason. There was no way to take in even half of what the game offered in just one sitting.</p><div id="2b962af97e7042a3b1e407a8dc280359"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWyMk-2aH9E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>This underlines how video game development was changing with 16-bit consoles. Many NES games were ports of arcade mainstays, perhaps modified to make them more suitable for extended play sessions. But they were still games meant to be finished in one session, once you got good enough. RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Warrior</em>, not to mention Nintendo’s own adventure game <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> bucked that trend with a bigger focus on exploration and a save feature so you could proceed at your own pace. But with the Super NES, developers were thinking bigger, regardless of genre.</p><p>For me, the finest example of this is <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. It was the second game I bought for the system, despite having never played the earlier NES Zelda games — the buzz around it was just too enticing. It was a smart choice, because it’s still on the short list of my favorite games ever. Its art style remains gorgeous 30 years later, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the freedom of exploration, combined with all the puzzles to unravel, was unlike anything I had played before.&nbsp;</p><div id="8cf31d34044e4a3cb7981b7bbc4d7273"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbIet2sM-JA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The story’s twists and turns made me always want to keep pushing forward, but I also was happy to go off the path and search for secrets I hadn’t found. And there are still a handful of show-stopping moments that rank among the most memorable game experiences I’ve had. Striding out of the Sanctuary after the first hour or so of gameplay with the booming main theme behind me, getting the Master Sword and the final showdown with Ganon after months of play leading up to it are just a few&nbsp; parts of the game that I’ll never forget.</p><p>Besides these bigger titles, the SNES still had plenty of arcade ports – they were just much better than in the NES era. The SNES was far more capable of replicating the arcade experience, and games like <em>Street Fighter II</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> were outstanding ways for me to get my arcade fix.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the SNES enjoyed strong third-party developer support from companies like Capcom, Konami, Tecmo, Square and Enix. And while I spent tons of hours on those aforementioned arcade games and other excellent titles like Capcom’s <em>Mega Man X</em>, the SNES allowed Nintendo to flex its muscles as one of the best game developers around.</p><p>The list of all-time classics that Nintendo published during the system’s lifespan is impressive. Aside from <em>Super Mario World</em>, games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Donkey Kong Country</em> (and its sequels), <em>Super Metroid, Yoshi’s Island, EarthBound</em> and <em>Super Mario Kart</em> were critically acclaimed, hugely popular or both. Launch titles <em>F-Zero</em> and <em>Pilotwings</em> didn&#39;t hit those heights, but they still provided the SNES with a strong and varied lineup from day one.</p><p>All these games and many more have kept me coming back to the SNES over the many years since it launched. I played it throughout high school and when I came home from college; at some point I lost track of that console and all the games I had, though. It was a tough pill to swallow, but since I (like many Nintendo fans) have re-bought favorite games on the systems like the Wii and the Switch, not to mention the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-snes-classic-edition-review.html">tiny SNES Classic Edition</a>. Of course, you can’t be the real thing, so I picked up a used SNES about 10 years ago, too. I don’t play it often, but I’m happier knowing I can when I want to.</p><p>It’s not just for nostalgia, either. Somehow, I have never played <em>Super Metroid</em> – and with <em>Metroid Dread</em> coming out soon, I think it’s high time I finally try another of the system’s all-time greats. I never would have expected that I’d be playing the Super NES 30 years after it arrived in the US, but I won’t be surprised if I still go back to these games 30 years from now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-30th-anniversary-193016005.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9090326c-1d9e-4f9b-b10b-6a5997326686</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 19:30:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629833419</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T19:30:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2f39beb0-050d-11ec-8b7f-d76bee7057ed" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2f39beb0-050d-11ec-8b7f-d76bee7057ed" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pint-sized 'Pac-Man' and 'PAW Patrol' arcade machines for kids are on the way]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;re never really too young to start gaming, but some kids might struggle to get to grips with standard arcade machines.

The online retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:4th-generation WiFi smart lock" href="https://fave.co/2PQ2RzI">4th-generation WiFi smart lock</a> for $179 when you use the coupon code <strong>ENGADGET20</strong> at checkout.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2PQ2RzI" id="5301e0581feb4f3cbbc6bb60c8f6bb1d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Wellbots;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy August WiFi smart lock at Wellbots - $179</a><p>August didn&#39;t fix what wasn&#39;t broken about its smart lock, but it did take the time to add features that make the 4th-generation feel like a substantial upgrade. It&#39;s half the size of the previous generation lock and it no longer requires a bridge thanks to its WiFi connectivity. Installation is pretty quick and easy, thanks in part to the helpful video instructions in the August mobile app, and we appreciate that the company forces you to turn on two-factor authentication during setup. It&#39;s an extra security measure that&#39;s especially important when you&#39;re talking about a device that lets people into your home. In addition to two-factor authentication, the lock also uses Bluetooth encryption, AES 128-bit and TLS encryption.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once installed, the mobile app can act as your digital keys, remotely locking and unlocking your door at any time. This makes it easy to let a friend or family member into your home when necessary even if you&#39;re away. You also don&#39;t have to forsake your physical keys all together — you can still use them to unlock your door at any time, so even if you forget to replace the smart lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries, you&#39;ll still be able to get into your home. Just make sure to check out <a href="https://support.august.com/deadbolt-compatibility-list-rkzJDLyR_G">August&#39;s support page</a> to see if your deadbolt is compatible with the smart lock before you buy it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/august-wifi-smart-lock-4th-generation-deal-exclusive-coupon-wellbots-132055001.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88a2d484-ffb0-4f85-b2fd-3a8540862e28</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:20:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629810141</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T13:02:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/e44e9720-bc76-11ea-9eb7-00cc03e3d519" width="960" height="640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/e44e9720-bc76-11ea-9eb7-00cc03e3d519" width="960" height="640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[August Smart Lock 4th gen]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[August Smart Lock 4th gen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify will allow any US podcaster to charge for a subscription]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify is expanding paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-podcast-subscription-platform-120040301.html">podcast subscriptions</a> to all US creators as a means of monetizing more content. Since its launch with a dozen indie publishers in the Spring, the premium option has been activated on 100 podcasts, according to the Sweden-based streaming service. On September 15th, subscriber-only content will be made available to international listeners. While overseas creators will have to wait a tad bit longer to get their hands on the monetization tools.</p><p>The program itself is available through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-anchor-podcast-playlist-format-133051601.html">Anchor</a>, the podcast creation platform Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-06-spotify-gimlet-anchor-podcast-profitable.html">acquired</a> alongside podcast network Gimlet for just shy of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/14/spotify-gimlet-anchor-340-million/">$340 million</a> in 2019. The company has billed the service as a win-win for its entire user base, giving publishers the chance to reap subscription fees with no commission (for the first two years) from avid listeners. Spotify will start taking a cut of 5 percent in 2023. Comparatively, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcast-subscriptions-172016084.html">Apple charges a $20 annual fee</a> for its program and takes a 30 percent cut of subscriptions for the first year and 15 percent thereafter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on learnings from its test period, Spotify is introducing 20 new pricing options for podcasts to offer creators more flexibility. It&#39;s also allowing publishers to download a list of contact addresses for their subscribers so they can better engage with them.

Not only will this help you better organize your library, the system will automatically generate personalized lists based on the movies you own. You should now see a My Lists tab next to My Movies.</p><p>Organizing a Movies Anywhere library presents a different challenge to grouping titles together on the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/prime%20video">Amazon Prime Video</a>. While subscribers of those services have access to the same content based on the country they&#39;re in, every Movies Anywhere user has a unique selection of films in their locker.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Movies Anywhere is looking to avoid having the same movie in too many lists. As such, movies are typically funneled into categories to which they&#39;re most closely matched.</p><p>One key part of the My Lists feature is that it takes into account viewing behavior. During a demo last week, Movies Anywhere didn’t go into too much detail about how this works. However, if you watch a few minutes of any film, the algorithm, artificial intelligence and machine learning systems will consider what you&#39;re interested in watching when they organize your lists.</p><p>Movies Anywhere’s content team classifies the films and there are around 2,000 different potential categories as things stand. These are centered around things like genres, franchises, people (say, actors, directors or composers) and themes. So, if you have a lot of movies about robots or cyborgs in your library, they might be grouped together in a list. Same thing goes for a collection of Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Other lists might focus on movies focused on antiheroes or musicians. The system might generate a list of nostalgic flicks, or classify films into subgenres.</p><p>Lists that Movies Anywhere creates for you are marked as &quot;automatic lists.&quot; You can also create and modify lists. You&#39;ll be able to add and remove films, reorganize lists and rename them. If you own all the Star Wars movies, for instance, you can place them in release order, sort them in the canonical timeline or even arrange them in the so-called <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/features/star-wars-movies-series-may-the-fourth-list-machete-order-sequence-rise-of-skywalker-clone-wars-last-jedi-2222667">Machete order</a>. It’s up to you.</p><p>One thing you can&#39;t do right now is modify any lists on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-samsung-smart-tvs-202921681.html">Movies Anywhere smart TV app</a>. You can only browse your lists there. But because your lists sync across devices, you can make changes on a phone, tablet or computer, and you&#39;ll see those reflected on your smart TV.</p><p>This is a useful update, especially for Movies Anywhere users who pick up a ton of movies during sales or those who redeem tons of digital codes from Blu-ray purchases. The service says that My Lists is &quot;a direct response to specific requests&quot; from users. It should bring some more order to users&#39; libraries, which can get unwieldy as they grow in size.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/movies-anywhere-my-lists-feature-ai-machine-learning-130038870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3eac470d-c270-46e9-a176-09b2b1a5d6e0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629811761</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T13:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a600040-04df-11ec-b9d3-bceb6f6a0076" width="3232" height="2046" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a600040-04df-11ec-b9d3-bceb6f6a0076" width="3232" height="2046" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Movies Anywhere My Lists section.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Movies Anywhere My List]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Yamaha's $500 wireless ANC headphones pack 3D sound and head tracking tech]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yamaha is releasing high-end headphones with adaptive audio tech and an eye-catching design to help them stand out in a crowded marketplace. The $499.95 <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-l700a/index.html">YH-L700A</a> are the latest over-ears to join the exclusive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-quantum-gaming-headphones-speaker.html">head tracking</a> audio club. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-27-dolby-dimension-wireless-headphones-review.html">Dolby Dimension</a> before them, Yamaha says its new headphones can identify where sound is coming from and re-orientate what you hear on the fly.&nbsp;</p><p>Working in tandem with the 3D audio, the tech aims to deliver an immersive experience that lets you track individual sounds. It all sounds similar to Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tvos-spatial-audio-181110124.html">Spatial Audio</a> or Samsung&#39;s rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review-163027027.html">360 Audio</a>. Yamaha&#39;s feature is called &quot;3D Sound Field&quot; and essentially leans upon its Cinema DSP processing to convert stereo sound into multi-channel audio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc1556f0-04c8-11ec-b7ff-8ffa523f4953" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A" data-uuid="8d89f7d6-8360-36a2-8e25-0aafc885239e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yamaha</div></figure><p>Overall, the headphones tick a number of boxes. There&#39;s &quot;advanced&quot; active noise cancelation (ANC) that can be switched on and off. Here, the system uses an algorithm and internal mics to adaptively remove ambient noise from the playback music signal.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, there are a range of audio modes that you can enable via an accompanying mobile app, which (along with the advanced ANC) are also available on the $350 <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-e700a/index.html">YH-E700A</a> headphones. They include a &quot;listening optimizer&quot; that can adjust the sound based on how you wear the headphones; &quot;listening care&quot; that promises a fuller range of audio at lower volumes; and &quot;ambient sound&quot; that uses the mics to capture external sounds and present them in the background of your audio. Yamaha claims you&#39;ll get an ambitious 34 hours of listening time per charge, though the jury&#39;s out on whether that will withstand rigorous testing.</p><p>While they retain some features from Yamaha&#39;s other headphones, they don&#39;t look like the company&#39;s prior efforts. Yamaha has switched from round to rectangular earcups that can swivel and fold. Like the headband, they&#39;re covered in a foamy fabric. The new headphones are out now at select retailers and on the <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/yh-l700a/index.html">Yamaha store</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-anc-headphones-130036800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30d6a7f4-6af0-48b5-977e-ed5efcb3b807</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 13:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629818818</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T15:27:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3fbb69e0-04c8-11ec-b2fe-c1b102980892" width="1280" height="854" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3fbb69e0-04c8-11ec-b2fe-c1b102980892" width="1280" height="854" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yamaha]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yamaha YH-L700A]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peloton's newer, safer Tread will be available to buy on August 30th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-plus-tread-plus-123651887.html">Peloton introduced its new lower-cost Peloton Tread</a> to the market, which was around $1,800 cheaper than the original Tread+ ($4,295). It was then sold for a short period of time in the UK, Canada and the US, where it had a limited invitation-only release. Then the company had to halt sales of the Tread and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-recall-cpsc-safety-us-canada-154309695.html">recall both its connected treadmills</a> after reports of several injuries and one fatality. The Tread in particular had to be recalled because its touchscreen console could detach and fall. The issues have since been fixed, but the incident obviously delayed the broader release of the Tread.</p><p>Now, the company is ready for a redo of sorts with a much wider launch. Peloton announced today that the newer, safer Tread will be available in the US, Canada and the UK on August 30th, while those in Germany will have to wait until later this fall. The Peloton Tread is priced at $2,495 USD ($3,295 CAD / £2,295 / €2495).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a reminder, the Tread includes many of the same features of the Tread+, albeit in a more affordable package. It has a 23.8-inch HD touchscreen instead of the 32-inch on the Tread+, and it uses a traditional running belt instead of a shock-absorbing slat belt. The Tread also has a slightly smaller footprint; it’s 68 by 33 inches, rather than 72.5 by 36.5 inches.</p><p>Peloton also emphasized software and hardware safety features in the new Tread, which helps address the recall concerns. One of them is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-treadmill-owners-will-be-able-to-run-again-without-a-paid-subscription-065018321.html">Tread Lock</a>, a mandatory four-digit digital passcode. Tread Lock will be available for both All-Access members as well as those without. There’s also a physical safety key that a runner can pull to quickly stop during a class.</p><p>Additionally, as you&#39;d expect, Peloton said that all Treads from here on out will have the improved hardware and software installed. That means that the touchscreen console is now securely attached to the Tread at all times, according to the company. As previously announced, existing Tread users can have this repair done for free.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/peloton-tread-sale-120039581.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b12ba5a7-64f8-4670-8798-0203881082a5</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 12:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629813416</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T13:57:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/446cea60-04d0-11ec-aef2-8c1825e40813" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/446cea60-04d0-11ec-aef2-8c1825e40813" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Peloton Tread]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Peloton Tread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Crypto heist hacker returns all $610 million they stole]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s the weirdest cryptocurrency heist so far. On Monday, Poly Network, a cryptocurrency finance platform, was hacked by “Mr. White Hat” who exploited a vulnerability in its code to steal $610 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other cryptocurrencies. The company now says it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/poly-network-161726337.html">recovered all the money it lost in the theft.</a></p><p>Less than a day after stealing the digital currencies, the hacker started returning millions saying they were “ready to surrender.” They subsequently locked more than $200 million in assets in an account that required passwords from both them and Poly Network. They said they would only provide their password once everyone was “ready.” At that point, Poly Network offered the hacker a $500,000 reward — a fraction of what they had stolen.</p><p>It’s not entirely clear why the hacker surrendered, but it may have been difficult to cash out the millions. The hacker says they were trying to contribute to the security of Poly Network. Maybe they just didn’t want to get caught.

But those who do get access to the test will be able to call friends on the platform without having to fire up the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>As the publication notes, this looks like a move Facebook is exploring to further streamline its services that include Messenger, which became a separate app in 2014, and WhatsApp. Connor Hayes, director of product management at Messenger, told <em>Bloomberg</em> that it&#39;s meant to reduce the need to jump back and forth between the company&#39;s main app and its Messenger service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook already has plans to unify its messaging apps. In September 2020, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chat-across-instagram-and-messenger-120049504.html">enabled the ability</a> to chat and send messages between Instagram and Messenger, and the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-30-facebook-will-let-users-chat-across-messenger-instagram-and-wha.html">previously said</a> that WhatsApp would also get inter-app messaging capabilities. The company tested putting a simpler version of Messenger within the main app last year, as well. That&#39;s something the social network been considering since at least 2019 when Jane Manchun Wong found an experimental feature that takes users straight to a &quot;Chats&quot; section when they tap on the messaging icon. Currently, doing so automatically opens the Messenger app.&nbsp;</p><p>Hayes told the publication that Facebook now considers Messenger as a service instead of a standalone app. We may see more of its technologies across the company&#39;s other apps in the future — in fact, Instagram, Oculus and Portal devices already use Messenger&#39;s technology for voice and video calls. &quot;You’re going to start to see quite a bit more of this over time,&quot; he said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-test-voice-video-calls-main-app-101603664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1a0cf5d-d2aa-420b-9707-dc8ce49b0ed3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 10:16:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629800174</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T10:16:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/ce493a30-e692-11e9-9b8d-d93c668dd8e2" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[May 26, 2019 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters located in Silicon Valley (1 Hacker Way);]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tourists posing in front of the Facebook Like Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oculus update lets Quest headsets auto-sync VR media to mobile]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Oculus">Oculus</a> is rolling out an update to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-oculus-quest-pro-vr-headset-164646103.html">Quest</a> VR headsets that includes several tweaks and improvements.

The video game giant has announced that it&#39;s making a Patents Pledge, which gives rival developers free access to any of its accessibility-related technologies. While not all gameplay mechanics are patented, some companies have <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/03/patents-on-video-game-mechanics-may-strangle-innovation/">taken to</a> making sure competitors aren&#39;t legally allowed to use their technologies. Critics condemn the practice, <a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/the-orcish-patent-how-do-video-game-patents-work-and-should-you-be-protecting-your-ideas/">accusing</a> the companies of stifling creativity and innovation in the industry. EA at least won&#39;t be suing anybody that incorporate its accessibility features in their games, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-31-gaming-irl-apex-legends.html">Apex Legends&#39;</a> &quot;ping&quot; system.</p><p>The feature gives players in the same team a way to communicate with each other without using voice chat. They can simply tap buttons to tell their teammates where they are on a map, to alert others of a threat or to tag targets. Supposedly, Epic Games borrowed <em>Apex&#39;s</em> ping system for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-28-fornite-season-eight-apex-legends-sea-of-thieves-theme.html"><em>Fortnite</em></a>. The Patents Pledge also covers at least four more EA features, three of which make video games more accessible to players with vision issues. Those technologies, already in use in the <em>Madden NFL</em> and <em>FIFA</em> franchises, can automatically detect colors and then modify their brightness and contrast to make them more visible.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last patent in the five EA specifically mentioned covers a technology allowing players with hearing issues to modify or create their own music. EA says it will add any future accessibility patents to the pledge and that it hopes the move can &quot;encourage others to build new features that make video games more inclusive.&quot;</p><p>Chris Bruzzo, EA&#39;s EVP of Positive Play, Commercial and Marketing, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;At Electronic Arts, our mission is to inspire the world to play. We can only make that a reality if our video games are accessible to all players. Our accessibility team has long been committed to breaking down barriers within our video games, but we realize that to drive meaningful change, we need to work together as an industry to do better for our players.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We hope developers will make the most of these patents and encourage those who have the resources, innovation and creativity to do as we have by making their own pledges that put accessibility first.
