The notorious con-man pretended to be Russian oligarch Simon Leviev, the son of Russian-Israeli diamond mogul Lev Leviev. He would take his victims — mostly Scandinavian women — on trips via private jets, stay with them in luxury hotels and treat them to expensive dinners. In truth, he&#39;s an Israeli man named Shimon Hayut, who fled to Europe twice to escape theft, forgery and fraud charges in his home country.&nbsp;</p><p>Online dating scams have been fairly common these past years, with con-artists using every available outlet into finding potential victims. According to the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/data-spotlight/2021/02/romance-scams-take-record-dollars-2020">FTC</a>, losses to romance scams reached a record $304 million last year. And that&#39;s just for the scams Americans reported to the agency. The Tinder Swindler hit the headlines for living a jet set lifestyle, though, with previous victims funding his efforts into wooing his current ones.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hayut would spend months pretending to be in a relationship with his targets before he begins asking them for money, usually pretending to be in trouble to ask his current &quot;girlfriend&quot; for help. Norwegian publication <a href="https://www.vg.no/spesial/2019/tindersvindleren/english/"><em>VG</em></a> spent six months tracking Hayut and got in contact with two of his most recent victims. One of the women it interviewed said she had to take out loans to help him out and ended up being scammed out of 2.1 Norwegian Krones (US$244,000).&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix&#39;s documentary will be produced by the makers of <em>Three Identical Strangers</em> and <em>Don&#39;t F*** With Cats</em>, both of which are also available on the streaming platform. It will also be directed by Felicity Morris of <em>Don&#39;t F*** With Cats</em>. <em>Variety</em> says it will follow the women Hayut conned as they &quot;uncover his true identity and bring him to justice.&quot; The Tinder Swindler was <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/tinder-swindler-released-from-prison-early-infuriating-fraud-victims/">arrested</a> by Greek police back in 2019 and was extradited to Israel, but he was released last year after only serving five months of a 15 month sentence.

The highlight feature of the company&#39;s new Seoul earbuds is a mode toggle that Urbanista claims reduces Bluetooth latency to about 70ms. A dedicated latency toggle isn’t something we’ve seen on a lot of true wireless headphones. Most gaming-oriented earbuds use Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html">aptX Bluetooth codec</a> to get latency as low as possible.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/43c4a0a0-ddb9-11eb-b736-0c4bdb031a57" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Seoul" data-uuid="9b3ff420-36d0-3eca-9065-df36a8d90925"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>With the codec’s low-latency variant, Qualcomm claims you get that number down to about 40ms. The downside of aptX is both your earbuds and phone need to support the codec. That’s not a problem with most Snapdragon devices since Qualcomm makes those too, but you won’t find the codec supported on Apple devices. That’s what makes the Seoul earbuds interesting. They give you a device agnostic way to get a low-latency mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that feature, the Seoul earbuds are about what you expect from a pair of mid-range true wireless earbuds in 2021. At $89.90, they feature a claimed eight hours of battery life on a single charge, with the included case allowing you to get another 32 hours of playtime before the entire unit needs to recharge. At that point, you can charge them using either a USB-C cable or Qi charging pad.  They’re also IPX4-certified, come with Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and feature both Google Assistant and Siri integration. Urbanista will sell the Seoul earbuds in four colors: black, blue, purple and white.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/09f791c0-ddb9-11eb-9fff-0accef854609" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Urbanista Lisbon" data-uuid="9f482045-319c-3af0-aae6-e16cd856821d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Urbanista</div></figure><p>For those looking for something more affordable, Urbanista also announced its new Lisbon earbuds. At $49.90, they’re the company’s cheapest true wireless earbuds to date. Looking at the spec sheet Urbanista sent over, they look decent too.

The open-source software is now collecting user data for &quot;app analytics&quot; and &quot;improving our app&quot; as well as &quot;for legal enforcement.&quot;</p><p>The privacy policy was updated on July 2nd, following Muse Group&#39;s <a href="https://mu.se/newsroom/tpost/6dhedma301-muse-group-acquires-audacity-expanding-c"><ins>acquisition</ins></a> of Audacity in April — Muse Group also owns Ultimate Guitar and notation app MuseScore. As reported by <a href="https://fosspost.org/audacity-is-now-a-spyware/"><em><ins>Foss Post</ins></em></a>, the policy notes Muse Group is collecting details about users&#39; operating system version, processor, country based on IP address, crash reports and non-fatal error codes and messages. According to the policy, processing that data is in the &quot;legitimate interest&quot; of the company &quot;to offer and ensure the proper functioning of the app.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The data it collects on law enforcement grounds is more vague. The policy says Muse Group will capture &quot;data necessary for law enforcement, litigation and authorities&#39; requests (if any).&quot; It may share personal data with &quot;any competent law enforcement body, regulatory, government agency, court or other third party where we believe disclosure is necessary.&quot; Data may be shared with potential buyers too.</p><p>Users&#39; personal data is stored on servers in the European Economic Area (EEA). However, Muse Group is &quot;occasionally required to share your personal data with our main office in Russia and our external counsel in the USA.&quot; Muse Group noted that whenever personal data is &quot;transferred outside the EEA to countries that are not deemed adequate by the European Commission, your Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in accordance with [the European Union&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr">General Data Protection Regulation</a>].&quot;</p><p>The policy states users&#39; IP addresses are &quot;stored in an identifiable way&quot; for a day before they&#39;re hashed. That leaves users open to identification through law enforcement or government data requests.</p><p>Several other points in the privacy policy have raised some eyebrows, including a ban on under-13s using Audacity. That, as <em>Foss Post</em> notes, violates the license under which Audacity is distributed. The General Public License prohibits restrictions on software use. Engadget has contacted Muse Group for comment.</p><p>All is not lost for Audacity users who value their privacy and pre-teens who tinker with audio in the app. Some users have been <a href="https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213">calling for</a> a fork of the software, a new version of the app based on the source code. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising to see the community take Audacity in that direction.</p><p>Until that fork arrives, privacy-conscious users might want to find alternative software, or at least block Audacity from accessing the internet. After all, it&#39;s a desktop app that doesn&#39;t have any tangible online functions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audacity-privacy-policy-spyware-accusations-data-collection-210001803.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06062508-3fd8-452a-96b6-f2b247d41c60</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 21:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625496852</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T14:54:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1732a0d0-dd9d-11eb-bbe7-ce8bd06a0ac6" width="891" height="570" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audacity]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook, Google and Twitter threaten to leave Hong Kong over privacy law changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tech companies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-hong-kong-stops-data-requests-134700801.html">at odds with the Hong Kong government</a>, and that tension appears to be on the rise. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-twitter-google-warn-planned-hong-kong-tech-law-could-drive-them-out-11625483036?mod=djemalertNEWS">learned</a> that the Asia Internet Coalition, a tech alliance including Facebook, Google and Twitter, has quietly warned Hong Kong that companies would stop operating in the territory if officials move forward with data protection law amendments that could hold companies liable for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-former-senate-it-worker-pleads-guilty-to-doxxing-senators-on-wik.html">doxxing</a> campaigns.</p><p>The tech giants are worried that staff could face criminal investigations or even charges if users share personal info online, even if they didn&#39;t mean any harm.  That would be a &quot;completely disproportionate and unnecessary response&quot; and could chill free speech, the Coalition wrote. The alliance instead suggested that Hong Kong narrow the scope of violations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hong Kong&#39;s Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data acknowledged the letter&#39;s existence, but said that new measures were needed after doxxing pushed the &quot;limits of morality and the law.&quot; The Commissioner also insisted that the changed laws would &quot;not have any bearing&quot; on freedom of speech, and wouldn&#39;t deter outside investment in the Hong Kong region.</p><p>The amendments could be approved by the end of the legislative year.</p><p>The concern, as you might guess, is that pro-China officials might abuse the updated laws to silence dissent. Pro-democracy activists doxxed police officers and others frequently during the 2019 protests, and there&#39;s a worry that the revised laws could be worded loosely enough that merely sharing a photo of someone in a public space could get both sharers and tech companies in trouble.

Now, scientists from <a href="https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/articles/year-2021/novel-microscopy-method.html">UT Southwestern</a> have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01175-7">developed</a> a new &quot;simple and cost-effective&quot; device capable of capturing multi-angle photos that can be retrofitted onto existing lab microscopes. The team say their solution — which involves inserting a unit of two rotating mirrors in front of a microscope&#39;s camera — is 100 times faster than converting images from 2D to 3D.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, this process involves collecting hundreds of photos of a specimen that can be uploaded as an image stack into a graphics software program, which then performs computations in order to provide multiple viewing perspectives. Even with a powerful computer, those two steps can be time-consuming. But, using their optical device, the team found they could bypass that method altogether.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s more, they claim their approach is even faster as it requires only one camera exposure instead of the hundreds of camera frames used for entire 3D image stacks. They discovered the technique while de-skewing the images captured by two common light-sheet microscopes. While experimenting with their optical method, they realized that when they used an incorrect amount of de-skew the projected image seemed to rotate.</p><p>&quot;This was the aha! moment,&quot; said Reto Fiolka, assistant professor at the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics at UT Southwestern. &quot;We realized that this could be bigger than just an optical de-skewing method; that the system could work for other kinds of microscopes as well.”&nbsp;</p><p>Using their modified microscope, the team imaged calcium ions carrying signals between nerve cells in a culture dish and looked at the circulatory system of a zebrafish embryo. They also rapidly imaged cancer cells in motion and a beating zebrafish heart. They also applied the optical unit to additional microscopes, including light-sheet and spinning disk confocal microscopy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microscopes-3d-images-cells-170004411.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ceb9ee1e-7839-4a55-838c-3a5d017f7537</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625504888</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T17:08:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/742cc040-dd89-11eb-af6f-f8d5a582c9ab" width="3766" height="2521" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW Pics via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Optic microscope with a blood smear sample.

The researchers used a membrane distillation process that resulted in 99.9 percent salt rejection for one month. If commercialized, they say the solution could help alleviate the drinking water crisis exacerbated by climate change. More than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/26/more-than-3-billion-people-affected-by-water-shortages-data-shows">3 billion</a> people worldwide are affected by water shortages, with the amount of fresh water available for each person plunging by a fifth over two decades, according to the UN.</p><p>The new study details a way to purify sea water using a a nanofiber membrane as a salt filter. While scientists have used membrane distillation in the past, they kept encountering a massive obstacle that slowed down the process. If the membrane became too wet, or flooded, it could no longer reject the salt. Needless to say, this was a time-draining process that forced scientists to either wait for the membrane to dry or come up with additional solutions, like using pressurized air to release trapped water from its pores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To overcome this challenge, the Korean team turned to a nano technology known as electrospinning to create their three-dimensional membrane. In scientific terms, they used poly vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene as the core and silica aerogel mixed with a low concentration of the polymer as the sheath to produce a composite membrane with a superhydrophobic surface. In essence, this created a filter that had a higher surface roughness and lower thermal conductivity, allowing it to desalinate water for up to 30 days. The full report was published in the <em>Journal of Membrane Science.</em></p><p>“The co-axial electrospun nanofibre membrane has strong potential for the treatment of seawater solutions without suffering from wetting issues and may be appropriate for real-scale membrane distillation applications,” Dr Yunchul Woo, a materials scientist at the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology, said. He added that the membrane may be appropriate for &quot;pilot-scale and real-scale membrane distillation applications.”&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the main method of purifying sea water is through reverse osmosis at the roughly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/climate/desalination-water-climate-change.html">20,000</a> desalination plants around the world. But these facilities require vast amounts of electricity to operate and also create concentrated <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/desalination-plants-produce-twice-as-much-waste-brine-as-thought">brine</a> as a waste product, which is typically dumped back in the sea. Therefore, it&#39;s no wonder scientists are exploring new solutions that aren&#39;t as counter-productive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nanofiber-membrane-drinking-water-150039679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a14a0633-0280-4cd7-bcef-fe4bb4a7766b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 05 Jul 2021 15:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625481855</ingested><modified>2021-07-05T10:44:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e3e3aa0-dd7b-11eb-bade-1c98e39feabb" width="965" height="595" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elsevier]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Membrane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[membrane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy VII Intergrade’s entertaining DLC should also be on PS4]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em> is a little confusing, if the name didn’t give it away. It’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-120044800.html"><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em></a>, remade (or at least polished up) for the PlayStation 5. It also includes new original content called “Intermission.” This is a two-chapter run completely separate to the main game, following the once-optional character Yuffie arriving into <em>Remake</em>’s main setting, Midgar, and bringing her own fight to the evil Shinra corporation. Sadly, you can only play Intermission with a PS5.</p><p>In <em>Remake</em>, each character had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-final-fantasy-7-remake-preview.html">unique playstyle in battle,</a> and that’s still true in Intermission. Yuffie’s battle style switches between long- and close-range fighting. She’ll hurl her oversized shuriken at enemies, and then either close the distance for melee attacks, or launch magical elemental attacks from afar, with the shuriken acting as a sort of lightning rod.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a young, out-of-town ninja, Yuffie also brings a healthy dose of sass and attitude to a game (and characters) that can take everything a little too seriously. The results are often hilarious. When you take on secondary characters from Remake in Fort Condor mini-games, she’ll talk smack to the likes of Jessie, Roach and Kyrie. At points, it’s borderline tone-deaf: Jessie may have just sent her friends, part of anti-Shinra group Avalanche, to their deaths. But from the perspective of Yuffie, she doesn’t know that, and when she crushes the anxious Avalanche member in a board game, the ninja doesn’t hold back.</p><section data-eng-breakout="655ff1edcd8f4a09957e2a3ae03e8ddc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc462110-d991-11eb-beae-355c192c530b" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade"></section><p>Soon into the first chapter, Yuffie is joined by a new character, Sonon. He acts as a close-range tank, distracting enemies from Yuffie who’s more easily damaged. While he’s an uncontrollable support character, and will choose his own movement and enemies to attack, you can still order him to attack with skills or equipped magic from the battle menu.</p><p>This leaves Yuffie able to deal damage safely from a distance; she has the ability to mete out elemental attacks without having to equip the necessary materia (orbs that add magic and skills to characters), able to attack weak points without tinkering much with your loadout. You can also bolster Sonan with materia, making him a more tempting lure to enemies, or just amping up his hit points to ensure he survives more often than not. Sonon also has a convenient resurrection skill that triggers if Yuffie gets KOed, ensuring you’ll center your fight strategies around letting Sonon draw the enemy’s attacks, while Yuffie attacks weaknesses and shoots across the area for enemy crowd control.</p><p>I’m impressed Square Enix was able to eke out yet another completely different fighting style for this DLC chapter — and this bodes well for the subsequent four characters that were party members in the PSOne’s <em>Final Fantasy 7.</em> In the original, barring stats and limit break attacks, characters were blank slates which you loaded out with materia to offer more attack options. In the Remake, they move and attack almost completely differently, demanding different playstyles when you switch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc4e1050-d991-11eb-bf6e-2a028996f9ae" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="074940c7-3c3b-398e-bd5f-2430bb3b1aff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There’s a PS5 version of Remake, too. Given that <em>FF7R</em> was a recent exclusive to the PS4, the changes aren’t groundbreaking but they’re certainly noticeable. I took issue with the grainy land and skyscapes you’d see from the detailed areas in <em>FF7R</em>, and in Intergrade, the resolution has been increased and detail improved. Things that the internet went to town on, like those <a href="https://kotaku.com/ffvii-remake-doors-look-much-better-on-ps5-1847062520">atrociously rendered doors</a>, have been fixed.</p><p>In Intergrade, you can now switch between performance (60fps fixed) and graphics (4K, more graphical flourishes) modes. The former is a revelation during your battles across both the game and the Intermission chapters, as your team fluidly moves around enemies. It feels easier on the eyes and just more satisfying to play. The original <em>Remake</em> (I hate having to write that) didn’t choke too often, but sometimes all the pyrotechnics and detailed boss battles did take its toll on framerates on the fourth-generation PlayStation. There&#39;s also a new photo mode in <em>Intergrade</em>, making it easier to captures some beautiful stills from what is a gorgeous game. I&#39;ve added my favorite shots at the bottom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/bc721311-d991-11eb-bf9d-f253c81ac19d" alt="Final Fantasy VII Intergrade" data-uuid="5ecd8276-3aa0-3b2f-b7ff-4a23b50b6511"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>There are some other PS5 upgrades, too. Yes, the DualSense’ haptic feedback occasionally kicks in but you’ll rarely notice it. I was only reminded of the difference during the motorcycle chase during the base game, where you can literally feel the texture of parts of your tarmac. Besides that and Cloud’s occasional memory flashes, no other times really stood out where the controller was offering me any extra immersive rumbles. As you might also expect, the loading speeds are also hugely improved: loading your saved game, or hopping between chapters are both incredibly swift.</p><p>One of the big criticisms leveled at Intermission is that these new chapters are playable only on the PlayStation 5 — if you’ve been able to buy one. But do the environments, battles and rambunctious ninjas demand next-gen console hardware?</p><p>Only Square Enix knows for certain, but I don’t think so. The PS4 would have struggled to keep up with Yuffie’s battle style, which sees her shooting across the battlefield after her oversized shuriken. There are other parts, as you navigate levels, that seem to be there expressly to showcase how smoothly the PS5 can handle a ninja hurtling down a mechanized fire pole, with scaffolding, levels and items shooting past — all backed by a five-track jazz arrangement. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-soundtrack-154531230.html">I&#39;m not joking</a>.</p><p>Right at the start of the Intermission chapters, Yuffie gingerly steps through a gap — one of the in-game slow-downs familiar to anyone that’s played <em>Remake</em> on the PS4. This seems to happen only once in the new parts of Midgar introduced in Intermission. It’s almost a knowing nod that things are going to speed up. And they do: the second chapter takes a few darker turns, and at times turns into a gauntlet of punishing battles that are both challenging and entertaining.

The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

These weren&#39;t obscure titles — the malware had over 5.8 million combined downloads and posed as easy-to-find titles like &quot;Horoscope Daily&quot; and &quot;Rubbish Cleaner.&quot;</p><p>The apps tricked users by loading the real Facebook sign-in page, only to load JavaScript from a command and control server to &quot;hijack&quot; credentials and pass them along to the app (and thus the command server). They would also steal cookies from the authorization session. Facebook was the target in each case, but the creators could just have easily steered users toward other internet services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were five malware variants in the mix, but all of them used the same JavaScript code and configuration file formats to swipe information.</p><p>Google told <em>Ars</em> it banned all the app developers from the store, although that might not be much of a deterrent when the perpetrators can likely create new developer accounts.  Google may need to screen for the malware itself to keep the attackers out.</p><p>The question, of course, is how the apps racked up as many downloads as they did before the takedown. Google&#39;s largely automated screening keeps a lot of malware out of the Play Store, but the subtlety of the technique might have helped the rogue apps slip past these defenses and leave victims unaware that their Facebook data fell into the wrong hands. Whatever the cause, it&#39;s safe to say that you should be cautious about downloading utilities from unknown developers no matter how popular they seem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-removes-android-apps-stealing-facebook-passwords-192721252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23ba4161-4838-44bb-bd4f-efe5c75e15f3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jul 2021 19:27:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625426857</ingested><modified>2021-07-04T19:27:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok's AI is now available to other companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-might-not-sell-tiktok-algorithm-to-us-buyer-184748008.html">TikTok&#39;s AI</a> is no longer a secret — in fact, it&#39;s now on the open market.

The Las Vegas Convention Center Loop is an underground transportation system that is the first commercial project by Elon Musk’s The Boring Company. The USD 52.5 million loop, which includes two one-way vehicle tunnels 40 feet beneath the ground and three passenger stations, will take convention attendees across the 200-acre convention campus for free in all-electric Tesla vehicles in under two minutes. To walk that distance can take upward of 25 minutes. The system is designed to carry 4,400 people per hour using a fleet of 62 vehicles at maximum capacity. It is scheduled to be fully operational in June when the facility plans to host its first large-scale convention since the COVID-19 shutdown. There are plans to expand the system throughout the resort corridor in the future.

The German car maker has <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-recall-24987.html">recalled</a> about 43,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-cross-turismo-ev-launch-153020559.html">Taycan Cross Turismo</a> EVs worldwide over a sudden power loss issue. You&#39;ll have to take your electric sports sedan to a workshop to receive an hour-long software update (over-the-air isn&#39;t an option this time), although Porsche said you could continue driving until the update is ready.</p><p>The bug has already been addressed for models rolling off the line, Porsche said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The recall was prompted by an NHTSA investigation of nine incidents where power shut off while the cars were in motion, with six of the cars refusing to restart. <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/07/01/porsche-taycan-recall-power-loss/">noted</a> that Porsche found the problem in 130 cars after conducting its own investigation. There haven&#39;t been reports of collisions or injuries.</p><p>The recall is a blow (if minor) to Porsche, which has generally enjoyed strong sales for the Taycan. The EV is now popular enough in the US that it&#39;s <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en_US/2021/company/porsche-cars-north-america-retail-sales-second-quarter-2021-24978.html">outselling</a> the 911, 718 and Panamera. While this isn&#39;t likely to tank sales, it comes as Porsche is still trying to persuade buyers that it&#39;s worth ditching the company&#39;s legendary gas engines for electric motors — it might face some hesitancy after this, even if EVs are likely to be more reliable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-ev-power-loss-recall-official-194259245.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">403f5c47-1372-4293-ac28-b7d6bca9cc69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 19:42:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625341427</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T19:43:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/002fcbe0-dc32-11eb-b7fb-186f20ce24eb" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/002fcbe0-dc32-11eb-b7fb-186f20ce24eb" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Baldwin/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan Turbo S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan Turbo S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC charges Broadcom with 'illegally monopolizing' the chip industry]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-broadcom-q4-022356419.html">Broadcom</a> is facing a major antitrust crackdown. <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/ftc-charges-broadcom-with-illegal-monopolization-of-the-1847224100">reports</a> that the Federal Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/07/ftc-charges-broadcom-illegal-monopolization-orders-semiconductor">charged</a> Broadcom with &quot;illegally monopolizing&quot; the markets for broadband and TV chips, including WiFi parts. The FTC claimed that Broadcom struck exclusive deals with vendors and service providers that prevented them from buying chips from rival suppliers.</p><p>The FTC also accused Broadcom of obtaining &quot;exclusivity and loyalty commitments&quot; for chip supplies, making it difficult for companies to compete on their own merits. The vote was near unanimous, although newly installed Commissioner <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html">Lina Khan</a> bowed out.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Commission&#39;s proposed action would forbid Broadcom from negotiating certain exclusivity and loyalty deals, bar the company from conditioning chip access based on commitments, and ban retaliation against customers who buy from Broadcom&#39;s competitors.</p><p>Broadcom signalled to Engadget that it might cooperate on a settlement. It still disagreed with the FTC&#39;s portrayal and claimed that it didn&#39;t break the law. You can read the full statement below.</p><p>The chipset giant hasn&#39;t exactly won favor from regulators in recent years. It spent 2017 and 2018 aggressively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-broadcom-abandons-qualcomm-deal.html">trying to buy Qualcomm</a>, only to give up after the White House <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-12-trump-blocks-broadcom-takeover-of-qualcomm.html">blocked the deal</a>. We wouldn&#39;t expect regulators to make too many concessions as a result, even if a settlement seems likely. Broadcom hasn&#39;t been shy about wanting to dominate the chip business — the FTC will want assurances the company won&#39;t push boundaries in the future.</p><blockquote><p><em>&quot;We are pleased to move toward resolving this Broadband matter with the FTC on terms that are substantially similar to our previous settlement with the EC involving the same products. While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us and continuing to focus on supporting our customers through an environment of accelerated digital transformation. We are equally pleased that the FTC investigation into our other businesses has been closed without action.&quot;</em></p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-charges-broadcom-over-antitrust-180605864.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d8298d72-9bf2-4856-bf18-9ca91f2d6cc1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 18:06:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625338543</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T18:55:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f8e973e0-dc22-11eb-b9e5-8517b5521c9d" width="2751" height="1659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f8e973e0-dc22-11eb-b9e5-8517b5521c9d" width="2751" height="1659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 03: An employee walks through the parking lot at a Broadcom office on June 03, 2021 in San Jose, California.
