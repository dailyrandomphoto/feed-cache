As <em>Windows Central</em><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/halo-infinite-getting-new-playlists-dec-14">notes</a>, 343 Industries community lead Brian Jarrard has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/re5kdv/playlist_update/">confirmed</a> a dedicated Slayer playlist is coming as part of an update on December 14th.

The December 14th update will also remove or ease the requirements for existing challenges while adding more to accompany the new playlists. There&#39;s a new challenge category based on player score that should better reflect your in-game performance, although it&#39;s only billed as an &quot;initial step&quot; toward true performance-based experience points.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This addition won&#39;t satisfy fans still waiting for promised features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-forge-delayed-183757524.html">campaign co-op or Forge</a>, which won&#39;t arrive until mid-2022 at the earliest.

The large screen (even on the 41mm model) makes a big difference for readability, not to mention control. Dust resistance and a more crack-resistant screen will help for venturing outdoors, while the fast charging should keep you going if sleep tracking or a lengthy workout has chewed through the battery. Add a strong app ecosystem and solid health features and the Series 7 is strong both as a first-time watch and a solid upgrade for anyone coming from Series 4 or earlier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few catches beyond the usual iPhone requirement. Apple&#39;s built-in sleep tracking won&#39;t compare to what you get from rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">Fitbit</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Samsung</a>, and the S7 chip isn&#39;t a breakthrough in performance. There&#39;s not much to tempt an upgrade if you&#39;re using a Series 5 or 6. Beyond that, however, t&#39;s an easy choice at this reduced price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-amazon-sale-blue-152250870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea89a436-f126-4ac5-95bd-651ba6a1d0f5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Dec 2021 15:22:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639322573</ingested><modified>2021-12-12T15:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76090360-5b56-11ec-9bfc-2bdd6f1d296d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/76090360-5b56-11ec-9bfc-2bdd6f1d296d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 in blue with Sport Band]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 in blue with Sport Band]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon explains outage that took out a large chunk of the internet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has explained the Web Services outage that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-web-services-outage-dec-2021-173157290.html">knocked parts of the internet offline</a> for several hours on December 7th — and promised more clarity if this happens in the future.

On day one of the IEDM conference in San Francisco, the two companies unveiled a new design for stacking transistors vertically on a chip. With current processors and SoCs, transistors lie flat on the surface of the silicon, and then electric current flows from side-to-side. By contrast, Vertical Transport Field Effect Transistors (VTFET) sit perpendicular to one another and current flows vertically.</p><p>According to IBM and Samsung, this design has two advantages. First, it will allow them to bypass many performance limitations to extend Moore’s Law beyond IBM&#39;s current nanosheet technology. More importantly, the design leads to less wasted energy thanks to greater current flow. They estimate VTFET will lead to processors that are either twice as fast or use 85 percent less power than chips designed with FinFET transistors. IBM and Samsung claim the process may one day allow for phones that go a full week on a single charge. They say it could also make certain energy-intensive tasks, including cryptomining, more power-efficient and therefore less impactful on the environment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>IBM and Samsung haven’t said when they plan to commercialize the design. They’re not the only companies attempting to push beyond the 1-nanometer barrier. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">In July</a>, Intel said it aims to finalize the design for angstrom-scale chips by 2024. The company plans to accomplish the feat using its new “Intel 20A” node and RibbonFET transistors.</p><p><strong>Update 12/12 12:20PM ET:</strong> IBM has clarified that VTFET will help it expand beyond its existing nanosheet technology, not necessarily to chips denser than 1nm. It also noted that you can have extreme improvements in performance or battery life, but not both. We&#39;ve updated the article accordingly and apologize for the error.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ibm-samsung-vtfet-semiconductor-design-announcement-213018254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4ce969b-e2a9-4437-909a-d854c4e9f8c2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 21:30:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639329807</ingested><modified>2021-12-12T17:23:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f8474310-5aab-11ec-b3ad-af9a91eaf8df" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f8474310-5aab-11ec-b3ad-af9a91eaf8df" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IBM / Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VTFET transistors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VTFET transistors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft fixed a Teams bug that prevented 911 calls on Android]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll want to quickly update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-personal-use-features-154524176.html">Microsoft Teams</a> if you&#39;re an Android phone user. <a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63">According</a> to former <em>XDA</em> editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman, Microsoft has fixed a Teams bug that led to failed 911 calls on devices using Android 10 or later. Reddit user KitchenPicture5849 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/">discovered</a> that having Teams installed, but not signed in, would prevent emergency calls from going through. The phone would say a call was active and ring once, but never properly initiate the connection — call logs would show nothing.</p><p>Rahman and friend Kuba Wojciechowski pinpointed the cause. While all Android calling apps will try to create a PhoneAccount class instance in the operating system, Teams was creating instances every time a user started the app &quot;cold&quot; — that increased the chances of a sorting problem that stopped calls from going through.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google talked to the Reddit user and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/">revealed</a> that both the company and Microsoft were planning fixes. In addition to the Microsoft patch, Google is delivering an Android platform update on January 4th that should address its side of the problem. You can delete and reinstall Teams to clear any excess PhoneAccount instances, and staying logged in should prevent any mishaps.</p><p>Google said this only affected a &quot;small number of devices.&quot; The issue, however, was the severity. This could have blocked someone from making a life-saving call through no fault of their own.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-911-call-android-bug-fix-201139753.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9366d23a-1369-48ff-9037-35831b046d97</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 20:11:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639253503</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T20:11:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/711ed980-00b1-11ea-acfd-294bb493c9cd" width="4888" height="3328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[releon8211 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Emergency and urgency, dialing 911 on smartphone screen.

Wheeler and Christina D. Rosan. Reprinted with permission from University of California Press.</p><hr><p>While this book is about reimagining sustainable cities, we pause here to connect sustainable cities with the larger national and international context in terms of spatial inequality. We live in a world that is deeply interconnected. If we want sustainable cities, we need to work on reducing spatial disparities between cities and rural areas, and between different regions worldwide. Linkages between communities need to be recognized, and resources shared and equalized. Situations must be ended in which some regions exploit others by giving them the unwanted by-products of production, such as pollution, waste, and labor exploitation, while simultaneously moving resources and profits from poor regions to rich ones.</p><p>In and around the towns of eastern Kentucky, where Stephen Wheeler’s ancestral family is from, people of English and Scottish descent lived for many generations as self-sufficient farming families. That way of life changed in the second half of the twentieth century. Better roads, electricity, and telecommunications connected Appalachia with the rest of the world. Urban job opportunities lured away the young. Farming families became part of the cash economy and acquired new desires for processed foods, appliances, motor vehicles, and personal accessories. But hill farms didn’t generate enough cash to buy such things, especially with rising federal subsidies for agribusiness in other parts of the country. So the people of eastern Kentucky became designated as poor and came to see themselves that way.</p><p>Environmental problems grew as well. Giant bulldozers scraped away hilltops and extracted coal, adding this region to the long list of others worldwide suffering from the “resource curse.” Runoff from coal mining poisoned wells and polluted waterways. Coal jobs left as quickly as they had come, leaving many even poorer.</p><p>A new, more globalized retail economy brought first Kmart and then Walmart, putting family-owned stores out of business. Fast-food outlets proliferated. But the new service economy jobs didn’t pay much. To make better money some people began growing marijuana in hard-to-reach locations in the hills. Drug use, alcoholism, and obesity spread. Fundamentalist religion gained adherents and combined with Fox News (starting in the 1990s) to promote reactionary political values. A region that had been Democratic until the late twentieth century now helped elect US Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). McConnell in turn played one of the largest roles in thwarting progressive legislation from Barack Obama’s administration, supporting Donald Trump’s presidency and fueling the rise of populism in the US.</p><p>If this tale of decline were one isolated example, it might not matter much. But spatial inequality persists and spreads worldwide. Some left-behind communities are rural. Others are urban. Entire countries are stuck in poverty due to the legacy of military or economic colonization. Spatial inequality is a core challenge to the development of more sustainable cities. Every community needs to be able to thrive, not just certain favored ones within a highly unequal global system. Instead of engaging in a zero-sum approach to development, with winners and losers, communities need to support one another so that all improve their quality of life and sustainability.</p><p>The so-called winners of today’s global economic competition have their own problems. At the other end of the spectrum from Appalachia is Silicon Valley. This forty-mile corridor in the San Francisco Bay Area is an economic dynamo envied the world over. Covered by orchards and agricultural fields in the 1950s, this beautiful area was known as “Valley of Heart’s Desire.” Now no orchards remain, and the region is a congested sprawl of poorly connected office parks, subdivisions, malls, and commercial strips. Incomes are high, but the price of a home is nearly five times that in the US as a whole. Many residents cannot afford housing near their jobs and so endure lengthy commutes or are housing insecure. Social inequality, traffic congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions expanded greatly during the past fifty years, reducing the quality of life in the region and contributing to global warming.</p><p>The Silicon Valley ethic of “move fast and break things” has created dynamic companies, unprecedented technology, and great wealth for a few. But the new gig economy pioneered there often operates at the expense of workers and the environment. It often produces an enormous concentration of wealth that comes from the exploitation of others. One study found that one-fifth of San Francisco Uber and Lyft drivers earned virtually nothing when their full expenses, including things such as health insurance, were accounted for. The tech industry has also been heavily criticized for sexual harassment during the MeToo movement and racism during the Black Lives Matter movement. The combination of individualism, predatory capitalism, toxic masculinity, and lack of concern for the common good that Silicon Valley represents works strongly against a sustainable and equitable future.</p><p>Similar problems of unequal development exist in other successful urban areas worldwide, including Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Bangalore, Singapore, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Paris, and Tel Aviv. Though among the world’s economic success stories, on many dimensions of sustainability they are failures. The growing core-periphery disparities that produce left-behind communities and “sacrifice zones” on the one hand and wealthy but unsustainable and highly unequal job centers on the other are at the heart of recent global development patterns.</p><p>Let us imagine instead a world where we are not content with the concentration of wealth and opportunity in a small number of global cities; where all communities have affordable housing and provide a decent quality of life; where cities meet the needs of people locally and regionally but do not drain wealth from other parts of the world; where no areas are left behind in the transition to a green economy, their populations increasingly alienated, despairing, and vulnerable to unscrupulous politicians and warlords; and where social dimensions of sustainability are well served everywhere.</p><h2>Sources of the Problem</h2><p>Today’s spatial inequity problems have long historical roots, illuminated by literature in fields such as economic geography, sociology, and environmental history. One starting point is physical geography. Some parts of the world have more fertile soils than others, more abundant mineral resources, more useful plant, animal, and fish species, and/or more benign topography and climate. Other places have been strategically well located to serve as trading centers and market towns or have been easy to defend against attack. Such communities have been able to accumulate modest amounts of wealth and power. The “chessboard” of geographical wealth is constantly shifting and with global warming is likely to shift in even greater ways in the future.</p><p>However, in other cases spatial inequities have resulted from military, religious, cultural, political, and/or economic systems that further centralize power and wealth. Typically these have drained resources from the periphery to the core of empires. Many parts of the world still suffer the legacy of colonization. Local traditions and cultures were disrupted, peoples were exploited, racism was institutionalized, ecosystems were harmed, and corrupt, colonizer-friendly governments were installed following independence. The damage has been so profound and long-lasting in many places that reparations may be appropriate. The need for climate justice may likewise call for reparations and repayments.</p><p>Twentieth-century economic development philosophies exacerbated spatial inequality on the assumption that economic globalization was to everyone’s long-term benefit. Various versions of “growth pole” theory, originating in the 1950s, sought to focus business development in particular geographical locales within countries on the assumption that this would leverage economic development in other parts. Such wider-scale progress was rare; growth poles instead often channeled resources to local elites, created isolated business enclaves, and harmed the environment.</p><p>The municipal economic development practice of chasing branches of multinational corporations has likewise undermined prospects for a more stable long-term economic base in cities worldwide. This “race to the bottom” competition leads suburbs to compete to host the newest shopping mall, central cities to compete for corporate headquarters, and states or countries to lower their environmental and labor standards to attract multinational corporations. However, the resulting businesses often don’t provide the expected number of jobs, pay the decent wages promised, or stay more than a few years. As Margaret Dewar has pointed out in her well-titled article “Why State and Local Economic Development Programs Cause So Little Economic Development,” politicians have an incentive in the short term to appear to be generating jobs by attracting well-known companies but little incentive to take into account long-term economic or environmental sustainabilIty. A recent example of the extreme lengths that municipalities will go to in order to attract development can be seen in the global competition for the second Amazon headquarters.</p><p>The Bretton Woods framework of post–World War II development assistance only deepened global spatial disparities, creating what economist Andres Gunder Frank termed “the development of underdevelopment.” Agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund loaned funds to developing countries for megaprojects that created wealth for elites but left others poor and displaced, while countries accumulated enormous debt to lenders in the Global North. National governments focused on what sustainability-oriented NGOs refer to as “extreme infrastructure.” These dams, power plants, industrial zones, and large-scale agricultural projects sought to jump-start an export-oriented form of economic development that was often environmentally harmful and funneled capital created by Third World labor and resources into First World bank accounts.</p><p>Yet another source of disparities has been the structural adjustment policies that neoliberal governments in wealthy nations insisted upon as a condition for international assistance during the past forty years. These require developing countries to take actions such as cutting social programs, privatizing public assets such as utilities and railroads, reducing barriers to foreign investment, and lowering taxes on the wealthy. The effect has been to make life harder for the poor while enriching elites and international corporations. It is increasingly clear that structural adjustment policies need to be discontinued and policies that promote spatial equity put in their place.</p><p>Finally, the offshoring of manufacturing from wealthy nations to low-cost and less regulated parts of the globe during the past half century has had complex effects on spatial disparities. It has impoverished the US Rust Belt as well as the British Midlands, leading to the growth of right-wing populism in both places. Meanwhile, it has helped fuel the rise of megacities and megaregions in the developing world, leading to massive internal migration and expanding economic disparities between those urban areas and the countryside. Undoubtedly, these global economic shifts have improved quality of life for many. But they have harmed others, disrupted societies, contributed to the climate crisis, and widened the gulf between rich and poor communities (figure 7).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1f1fc860-56c7-11ec-bffd-16e17bfa19fa" alt="Figure 7" data-uuid="b580afab-a76e-34ee-aff7-402996e8b255"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">UC Press</div></figure><p>Although spatial disparities are still expanding in many places, there is hope for the rebirth of left-behind cities and regions. Manchester, UK, the first industrial powerhouse in Europe, lost much of its manufacturing in the middle of the twentieth century but has since rebuilt itself by focusing on culture, education, physical regeneration, and its geographical role as a transportation center. The US steel capital of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, after losing 350,000 industrial jobs in the 1980s, reinvented itself as a center of renewable energy, health care, and education. Even the long-declining hulk of Detroit, one of the most hollowed-out American cities, is showing signs of a turnaround. Examples such as these indicate the possibility for left-behind places to rebound. But all of these cities had assets to start with, including a strong identity and an active elite that led revitalization efforts. Other communities and regions don’t have such advantages. And the pervasive problems associated with spatial inequality affect wealthy as well as declining places, necessitating holistic and imaginative solutions at higher levels of governance.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-reimagining-sustainable-cities-christina-rosan-stephen-wheeler-uc-press-163019173.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">253db024-1dd1-4cbc-a6fd-ff57dd237c7b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638829375</ingested><modified>2021-12-06T22:23:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/df350100-56cd-11ec-a97f-4e512f1fee0d" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff225fd0-56cd-11ec-87ff-1b44c22b3958" width="3000" height="1897" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Tama via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BOONEVILLE, KY - APRIL 20:  A man walks beneath an American flag at the Owsley County Saddle Club trail ride on April 20, 2012 in Booneville, Kentucky.

Peloton is worried viewers might think the Bike was responsible, and not just because the show might hurt sales — the company&#39;s stock price plunged between December 9th and December 10th, and it didn&#39;t get much better by the weekend.</p><p>In a statement, Peloton health and wellness advisor Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum argued that Mr. Big&#39;s death likely occurred despite the Bike, not because of it.

If anything, Dr. Steinbaum suggested, Big&#39;s riding might have &quot;helped delay&quot; his heart attack.</p><p>Peloton also said it was caught off-guard. Spokesperson Denise Kelly <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/davidmack/peloton-big-just-like-that-hbo">told</a><em>BuzzFeed News</em> the company was aware an HBO-purchased Bike would be in the episode and that King would portray an instructor, but &quot;confidentiality reasons&quot; prevented it from learning about the tragic plot point until the <em>And Just Like That</em> premiere.</p><p>This likely won&#39;t significantly dent Peloton&#39;s sales figures. Still, this probably isn&#39;t the publicity the firm wanted as it grapples with a treadmill recall and stiffer competition from rivals like Bowflex, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echelon-prime-bike-shutdown-093532139.html">Echelon</a> and NordicTrack. Peloton may have to hope <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-price-cut-230347867.html">price cuts</a>, a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-guide-machine-learning-strength-training-152637209.html">strength training camera</a> and a loyal following will help it overcome any hesitancy from <em>Sex and the City</em> fans.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sex-and-the-city-peloton-bike-scene-152028623.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b237a7b-d006-4bb1-908e-414f6e24689a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Dec 2021 15:20:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639239577</ingested><modified>2021-12-11T16:19:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7e185d50-5a8c-11ec-97de-17cd16d432dd" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7e185d50-5a8c-11ec-97de-17cd16d432dd" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Scott Heins via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 04: A Peloton stationary bike sits on display at one of the fitness company's studios on December 4, 2019 in New York City.

CEO Pete Parsons said his hope was the studio’s efforts would set an example for the wider gaming industry. At the time, it appeared the announcement was a proactive move by Bungie, but now it seems the studio was responding to some of its own inner turmoil.</p><p>In response to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><ins>story from </ins><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a> reporting on years of systematic sexism and workplace harassment at the studio, Parsons has <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/50895">published an apology letter</a>. “I am not here to refute or to challenge the experiences we&#39;re seeing shared today by people who have graced our studio with their time and talent,” he says. “Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologize personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feels a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>He says over the last several years Bungie has made “significant” changes to foster a better workplace. At the top of that list, he notes the studio has removed “bad actors” irrespective of their “tenure, seniority or interpersonal relationships.”</p><div id="3ff7c5da43c74468bad77fb5ca4cde22"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you so, so much to everyone who spoke to me and trusted me with your stories for this piece. To readers, please remember that with articles like this, there is often so, so much more beneath the surface that couldn&#39;t be included for any number of reasons.</p>— Rebekah Valentine (@duckvalentine) <a href="https://twitter.com/duckvalentine/status/1469351594462363652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>That’s not something it appears was true of Bungie in the past. In one section of the report, <em>IGN</em> recounts the story of a <em>Destiny</em> narrative lead who threw a chair at a window because “he felt others were ruining his creative vision of the game.” That individual reportedly stayed at the company for several years after that incident until he left and was later hired to do contract work for <em>Destiny 2</em>. The report also notes many employees wrote letters to Parsons begging for him to intervene in a variety of workplace issues. He reportedly never responded to those pleas.</p><p>As things stand today, Parsons says he believes employees whose behavior warranted removal were either fired or they no longer work at Bungie. If new information comes to light, Parsons pledged Bungie would investigate those reports “with integrity.”</p><p>After reiterating the studio’s commitment to the reforms it announced in September, Parson’s letter turns to Bungie’s recent hiring efforts. Over the past five years, he says the number of employees who identify as women or as someone from an underrepresented community has increased to 20.5 percent and 18.6 percent, respectively. In 2021, 31 and 23 percent of the studio’s hires were employees who identified as part of those two groups. What he doesn’t mention is where those numbers were previously. Without historical data, it’s impossible to know how much better Bungie has become at hiring more diverse candidates.</p><p>While the sexual harassment scandal at Activision Blizzard has dominated headlines in recent months, today’s <em>IGN</em> report underscores that there are toxic workplaces across the gaming industry. Harassment and management protecting abusers: these are issues that keep coming up year after year. They&#39;re not exclusive to one company because many of them have been built in the same way, and it will take a concerted effort to undo those cultures.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-responds-ign-report-211235404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">12b67c0c-fc37-4b4f-8d94-06faecc085d3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 21:12:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639170780</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T21:13:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/3371d680-beb4-11e9-bffd-5994cda4b1a3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-08/3371d680-beb4-11e9-bffd-5994cda4b1a3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bungie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Destiny 2 'Titan' prepares to fight some of the game's Hive enemies.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Destiny 2 screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter reportedly knew Spaces could be misused due to a lack of moderation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter%20spaces/"><ins>Twitter Spaces</ins></a> debuted earlier this year, hundreds of people have reportedly joined live audio discussions led by &quot;Taliban supporters, white nationalists, and anti-vaccine activists sowing coronavirus misinformation.&quot; According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/10/twitter-turmoil-spaces/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a><em>,</em> Twitter didn&#39;t have the moderation tools necessary to combat bullying, calls for violence and hate speech in Spaces before rolling out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/clubhouse/"><ins>Clubhouse</ins></a> competitor — despite executives knowing that would likely lead to misuse.</p><p>Spaces doesn&#39;t have human moderators or tech that can monitor audio in real-time. It&#39;s much more difficult to automatically review audio than text. So far, Twitter has relied on the community to report Spaces they think violates the company&#39;s rules. However, if a host uses the feature as a soapbox to share transphobic, racist or otherwise bigoted views (<a href="https://katelynburns.medium.com/twitter-spaces-are-a-damn-mess-5b5707698827"><ins>as has reportedly happened</ins></a>), and their audience agrees with them, it seems unlikely that a listener will report the discussion to Twitter&#39;s safety team.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the report, Twitter&#39;s technology helped some of these discussions to go viral. Because these Spaces were amassing large audiences, the systems understood them to be popular, and promoted them to more users. Twitter spokesperson Viviana Wiewall told the <em>Post </em>the supposed bug has been dealt with.</p><p>“Ensuring people’s safety and encouraging healthy conversations, while helping hosts and listeners to control their experience, have been key priorities since the beginning of [Spaces’] development,” Wiewall told the publication. Wiewall noted that the company is &quot;exploring avenues&quot; in terms of moderating Spaces in real-time, &quot;but it’s not something that we have available at this time.”</p><p>The spokesperson noted that Twitter did have some protections in place. It can scan the titles of Spaces to look for keywords that raise red flags, but modified spellings can ensure problematic words bypass the filters.</p><p>Twitter employees are said to have raised concerns about unmoderated live audio rooms, but some of those who suggested the company should slow down and work on technology to improve safety were reportedly dismissed from or left out of meetings. Leaders forged ahead with the Spaces feature anyway, at least in part to appease investors by speeding up product development and generating more revenue.</p><p>Since August, hosts who meet certain criteria have been able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ticketed-spaces-launching-224353538.html"><ins>charge for access to Spaces</ins></a>, with Twitter taking a cut. The company has been chasing other revenue streams beyond advertising, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-revue-newsletter-service-124341255.html"><ins>newsletters</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-twitter-blue-worth-3-dollars-a-month-210059983.html"><ins>Twitter Blue premium subscription</ins></a>. There have been issues with some of those products too. The Tip Jar feature, through which users can send payments to each other as tips, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tip-jar-201442453.html"><ins>exposed some tippers&#39; home addresses</ins></a> via certain types of PayPal transactions.</p><p>Engadget has contacted Twitter for comment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-reportedly-knew-spaces-would-be-misused-due-to-lack-of-moderation-201501061.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">67048150-8478-40c0-9b77-a67594843255</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 20:15:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639166351</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T19:59:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0c075350-beca-11eb-9bff-1ad572e04754" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0c075350-beca-11eb-9bff-1ad572e04754" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/03/12: In this photo illustration the Twitter Spaces page is seen on a smartphone screen  with a Twitter logo in the background.

He calls it MetaWorld and describes it as a persistent, decentralized space filled with life and change. It’s a “10,000 square mile vast-scale simulation, owned by community and run by community,” according to Reid. He’s said it’s his life’s work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cc6b9620-587a-11ec-9ade-3930bbbcd178" alt="MetaWorld splash screen" data-uuid="c6e80f52-b039-3a0e-970a-2f86b36fff96"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld</div></figure><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html">many other organizations</a> at the moment, Reid has been using the buzz around the metaverse to ramp up his own promotional efforts. MetaWorld has a slick website, a fresh YouTube channel, a new Discord server and Reid hosts daily chats on Clubhouse. He recently launched a marketplace where he&#39;s selling digital parcels of land and property as NFTs.</p><p>In the MetaWorld Discord server, a “press” channel lists articles from Engadget, <em>Alphr</em>, <em>TechRadar</em>, <em>UploadVR</em>, <em>VentureBeat</em>, <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>, <em>Variety</em> and <em>CNBC</em>, and links to a video from <em>New Scientist</em> magazine.</p><p>Early on November 3rd, a user named Wolfssskin entered the MetaWorld press room and started typing.</p><p>“Interesting that you think you can do the same scam again,” Wolf said.</p><p>“What’s interesting is that you think that you can stalk and harass me,” Reid wrote back. The confrontation continued with Reid accusing Wolf of being a troll, and Wolf claiming MetaWorld was a scam. The exchange has since been deleted, and Wolfssskin banned from the server.</p><p>However, Wolf is active on another Discord server — this one also called MetaWorld and also created by Reid, though he hasn’t posted in it since 2019. The old server is full of angry users who say they gave Reid their money between 2016 and 2018 to join MetaWorld, and believe they were scammed.</p><p>Reid’s final message in the old MetaWorld Discord server was posted on September 6th, 2019: “Check updates on the updates channel in coming weeks … I&#39;ll also be around with mods for discussion all week.” No update ever came, and in the two years since, the old server has become a guide to the seven stages of grief.</p><p>“It&#39;s disgusting to think that they have just left paying customers with not even a response,” a user named LordGirthVader wrote in June 2020.</p><p>“Yeah but that’s the thing,” another user named Floogey responded, “We weren’t actually customers, we were victims.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="fa242dd79b434aeba249af74c51cf2e2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/125f30a0-587c-11ec-bfbe-11285c659391" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>Engadget first interacted with Reid in 2016, when a UK startup named Improbable arranged a meeting inside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-03-hello-vr-metaworld-improbable.html">a MetaWorld prototype</a> to demonstrate Spatial OS, the startup’s scalable server tech. Reid was one of several developers to make use of the company’s public SDK, and Improbable thought MetaWorld made an effective demo to promote its “open community platform.”</p><p>Shortly after the launch of that prototype, Improbable stopped promoting or mentioning MetaWorld at all. By 2017, questions were being raised about Reid’s ability to deliver on his ambitious promises, which included a custom avatar system, a living world as large as the state of Maryland, a virtual economy, rich environmental simulations and cross-platform capabilities for a variety of VR headsets.</p><p>Reid started <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/metaworld-the-vr-mmo-simulation--2#/">an Indiegogo campaign</a> in April 2017, a move that prompted his former business partner and MetaWorld prototype developer, Carelton DiLeo, to publicly distance himself from the project. DiLeo noted that he was “not currently working on MetaWorld” and didn’t know how Reid planned “to deliver on the promise of the fund.”</p><p>The Indiegogo campaign was not a success, eventually raising $3,674 of a $50,000 flexible goal, meaning Reid got to keep all of the money pledged. This was followed by a new revenue-driving initiative: land speculation. In September 2017, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/metaworld-wants-buy-virtual-land-real-money-not-clear/">Road to VR</a><em>&nbsp;</em>noted that Reid was selling virtual land for real money, and detailed the many questions surrounding the project. Land was available to buy in three tiers, ranging from $15 for a quarter acre to $100 for two acres, though it was unclear what exactly players would do with this property, how the economy would function or how people who didn’t buy land would join the game.</p><p>MetaWorld was listed on Steam as an Early Access title in mid-2017, advertising consistent updates and transparent, community-driven development. There was no actual game to play, no virtual world to explore, but Reid was selling land in MetaWorld regardless. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/?appids=511100&amp;appgroupname=MetaWorld+-+The+VR+MMO+Simulation&amp;feed=steam_community_announcements">September 28th, 2017</a>, a blog post in the MetaWorld Steam community claimed land titles were being sent out to investors, supported by a cryptocurrency Reid had created called MetaCoin.</p><p>In its September 2017 article, <em>Road to VR</em> concluded, “MetaWorld is headed into Early Access, which partly excuses it from being an incomplete product, but the inconsistency in messaging around the game’s core mechanics and features ought to leave you worried about the stability of the still unreleased MMO.”</p><p>By early 2018, Reid claimed he had been investing in crypto for several years to form the economy of MetaWorld, using the cash from early land sales to build the MetaCoin fund. He said he wasn’t personally making any money in the process, and all of the money coming into MetaWorld was being converted into cryptocurrency and kept in a single place called the Metabank, where it was reserved specifically for this new virtual economy.</p><figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/574ccc9e44607bcd495dbce67a3b8292/204148197/metaworld.jpg" data-uuid="f48103b0-bddd-3b2a-b111-63f228c74fb6"><figcaption>The 2016 MetaWorld prototype Engadget experienced.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld</div></figure><p>Reid told Engadget in 2018, “We&#39;re a community-funded entity. So we&#39;ve been working on that, in fact taking on cash and kind of forming it into cryptocurrency, and building an economy.” He said he was using “robo-trading, a couple different investment tools to grow the money.”</p><p>Roughly a year after saying that, Reid left his final message in the original MetaWorld Discord and disappeared from the server.</p><p>A few weeks after Reid’s quiet exit, a user named Immortal posted in the lobby, “Been a while since I’ve heard anything on this game and even longer since my money was happily taken for it. Anyone know anything about this release or is this just one of those things that never happen?”</p><p>“I don’t expect anything to happen,” a user called Myrothas replied. “Asked for a refund a year ago and many times. All I heard was: send me a mail. I did do that multiple times and never received an answer. Quite the red flag for me.”</p><p>Myrothas, real name Johannes Fischer, shared with Engadget a 2018 email exchange where he requested a refund through the MetaWorld help channel. “Backed this project about a year ago and expected it to come out already,” he wrote in the email. “I’d like to ask for a refund.” He says he never received his money.</p><p>Engadget interviewed Reid twice in 2018. In these interviews, Reid explained how paying customers would build MetaWorld themselves, and how cryptocurrency would make the whole thing work as a decentralized, libertarian dreamscape. With players responsible for funding and developing MetaWorld themselves, it was difficult to pin down what exactly Reid was selling.</p><p>One year after the launch of his crowdfunding campaign, Reid said he had “a design worked out in Unity” for MetaWorld, and he planned to transfer this into the existing Spatial OS ecosystem — even though Improbable, Spatial OS’ parent company, wasn’t actively supporting the project any longer. He claimed he’d built a procedural terrain generator for VR and also a robust avatar system with “head tracking, eyes, eye blinking, eye gazing, lip sync, upper torso support,” though these features weren&#39;t ever demonstrated.</p><p>Most of Reid’s goals never materialized. The MetaWorld release date was pushed back again and again, until eventually the Steam page simply read, “Soon.” Reid showed off high-fidelity environments on YouTube and Discord, and then later revealed MetaWorld would be a Google Blocks project, making those assets impossible. MetaWorld never went live.</p><p>“We had a lot of broken promises right off the bat, that was a pretty major flag,” one early adopter told Engadget under the condition of anonymity. We’ll call them Morgan. “And the community was very quick to do some snooping.”</p><p>Engadget spoke with 11 original MetaWorld investors, including people who were deeply involved in the community and often interacted with Reid directly. Many of these members asked not to be named, considering Reid had their personal information and they didn’t trust him to not misuse it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8dabb460-58e8-11ec-9b7b-5e7b442ca566" alt="MetaWorld Discord" data-uuid="0bf3f0ac-d353-364b-82c8-26919808217e"><figcaption>Users commiserating on the original Discord server in 2020.

As people would ask for refunds in the original Discord server, Reid would call them trolls and delete their messages.</p><p>At the time, as calls for refunds were flooding the MetaWorld community, Reid told Engadget he was “in the process of coming up with a better refund policy” and he wanted to honor these requests, but it was difficult to do so without seriously affecting development. Not that Reid planned on doing much development himself — as he described it, he was a designer, the guy with the vision. According to his plan, the community would do the actual coding and game-making, after buying their way into MetaWorld.</p><p>“It was around then that we learned that users would also be responsible for creating assets,” Morgan said. “Assets included anything from buildings to animals… but we&#39;d also be responsible for creating jobs, and performing said jobs to earn currency on the blockchain.”</p><p>Besides that, Reid told Engadget he planned to piggyback off the work happening at multibillion-dollar companies like Facebook, IBM and Google. He pointed out that these organizations had already built VR worlds, avatar systems and AI frameworks, and he said he’d simply use these to create MetaWorld. He seemed unconcerned with the concepts of intellectual property and trade secrets.</p><p>“From my perspective, all code is done and written,” Reid said. A few minutes on, he continued, “The code that drives the artificial intelligence — Watson, or just name your AI code — it exists, right? So I can play with concepts, whereas code&#39;s already written, right? You know what I mean? I can take from any code set I want. And I think by understanding code — I also write code. But rather than get heads down on writing code, I sort of enjoy dreaming up concepts and just understanding how things are put together.”</p><p>In the end, Reid was basically selling an early-concept <em>Roblox</em>, in VR and for adults. But first, he was asking players to build the game itself and pay him for the privilege. After all, he said, actually making MetaWorld was the easy part.</p><p>“This stuff is like, it isn&#39;t rocket science,” he said. “It&#39;s really pretty straightforward to throw a couple objects around and create a couple simulations, a couple VR simulations and put them together. That&#39;s not the hard part, like, making some VR games.”</p><p>That rudimentary 2016 demo, built before developer DiLeo left the team, is the only public proof that Reid’s MetaWorld has ever existed as an inhabitable virtual place. DiLeo went on to build his own simulated environment using Spatial OS, and he <a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2018/10/somnium-space-announces-acqusition-of-community-garden/">sold it in October 2018</a> to Somnium Space, which is an established, decentralized VR platform powered by blockchain. As part of that deal, Somnium Space offered a refund and land-exchange program for angry MetaWorld customers, in an effort to rebuild trust in VR development as a whole.</p><p>In October 2021, two years after Reid’s final message in the old Discord, a new MetaWorld server appeared. It had a fresh logo, links to his Clubhouse group, and the same pitch as before. A “passports” channel linked to a page where people could pay $10, $20 or $30 for “exclusive community access,” the opportunity to build MetaWorld, and early bidding on future NFT drops.</p><p>At the time of publishing, MetaWorld NFTs have raised 5,126 MATIC (around $11,000) since their launch on November 25th.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/455c9980-58ee-11ec-bff8-f36f0d951a86" alt="MetaWorld NFT sampling" data-uuid="b52b6915-6f54-3028-b326-a465aaf714c9"><figcaption>Listings for MetaWorld NFTs.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MetaWorld/Niftykit</div></figure><p>Reid is now selling virtual land and properties as NFTs on the Polygon network, and people are buying. Land tends to run from $50 to $600, payable in Polygon’s MATIC currency, while a “Piano House” costs $650 and seems to be available via cash payment only. The MetaWorld website claims just 10 of these houses will be minted and simulated.</p><p>“So much excitement, creative thoughts and passion for the future,” Discord user Clare Bratina wrote in the new MetaWorld server on November 25th. “Definitely backing the creators and looking forward to learning how to create in the metaverse and on metaworld.”</p><p>Every now and then in the new server, a random member will spam the channels with warnings claiming that MetaWorld is a scam, and Reid will deny it and delete the messages. Just like old times.</p><p>There is one new, unexpected feature of the revamped MetaWorld campaign: Reid, who happens to be Black, is targeting people of color.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7424ea2c4dab4653a5e6cfdf8bfc3dbc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/41f97820-587c-11ec-9fe4-54a925240967" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>“So happy this exists!” a user called NiKole wrote in MetaWorld’s “town-square” channel on September 5th.</p><p>In October, a member named PixelPil0t posted, “Happy to join your Metaworld! Excited to see what you build Dedric, your background is incredible.”</p><p>Over the past few months, Reid has been doing much of his MetaWorld marketing on Clubhouse, where he has 1,800 followers and regularly joins talks with the <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMetaverse">Black Metaverse</a> community, which is run by NiKole. Here’s how Reid closed out <a href="https://twitter.com/dedricreid/status/1456662553866637316">a Clubhouse chat</a> for Black Women in Blockchain on November 5th, after spending a few minutes selling MetaWorld as a Hawaii-sized VR landscape where players would be able to fly airplanes and play around in a persistent, living environment:</p><p>“Much of the inspiration for the world is gearing it towards POC first. You know I&#39;ve been in, sort of, the games and media industry for quite some time. And, you know, as a community we&#39;re often left behind. It&#39;s, you know, the computational world isn&#39;t exactly ‘us’ first, sort of, you know, we&#39;ve been an afterthought. So now we are. So check out the identity system. Look forward to seeing Black faces in the MetaWorld. Peace. My name is Dedric.”</p><p>New users have been trickling into the new MetaWorld Discord server and Reid has been organizing its channels, most of which are empty. It’s mostly newcomers, but there are also a handful of folks from the old MetaWorld server floating around, tracking the similarities between the previous project and the new promises.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6d37c6d0-58f0-11ec-bddc-038b4939fa4c" alt="MetaWorld Creators Channel Log" data-uuid="b88db2df-10a8-3df6-8910-1dab1556d39e"><figcaption>The &quot;creators&quot; channel showed off MetaWorld&#39;s photogrammetery.

This user found the original images on a website unassociated with MetaWorld or Reid, and Engadget eventually traced all the images in channel back to an <em>80 Level</em> interview with <a href="https://80.lv/articles/how-does-mawi-united-create-natural-assets/?amp_markup=1">environmental artist Willi Hammes</a> of MAWI United.</p><p>Engadget spoke with Reid in November, when the creators channel was still live, and asked him what photogrammetry software he was using to build MetaWorld.</p><p>“I&#39;m not actually sure,” he said. “I&#39;m not working on the photogrammetry stuff. So I&#39;d have to ask somebody from my team what they&#39;re using to capture it.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d7869700-58f0-11ec-bef7-b6cfdab325a6" alt="Creators channel asset appropriation evidence" data-uuid="97f5c00d-b79e-33b1-b979-5bc625b60f5f"><figcaption>Original backer BenG found the original versions of many MetaWorld-related assets.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Discord</div></figure><p>Reid said he had a few freelancers working on the project, but he presented himself as the sole full-time creator of MetaWorld. Minutes after our interview, the creators channel disappeared from the Discord server, taking all the photogrammetry claims with it.</p><p>Other MetaWorld assets vanished around this time, too. Reid deleted and unlisted at least two YouTube videos after facing questions about their origins. One of them, called “Generative + Procedural Design Redwood Creek,” was a minute-long speedrun through the Unreal Engine 4 development process, showing the creation of a lush forest scene. It was published on October 31st. The MetaWorld logo was prominently displayed over the entire video, it started and ended with the URL for the MetaWorld website, and its description read, “Using a combination of procedural / generative Design and hand freehand design to construct MetaWorld Redwood Creek region.”</p><p>After establishing we were talking about the same video, I asked Reid point-blank, “So that video, that was you in MetaWorld making something?”</p><p>He was silent for seven seconds. “The video’s MetaWorld, yes,” he finally said.</p><p>However, the footage in question was originally posted to YouTube by a user named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSlfV-DaURg">Nitrogen in March 2019</a>, without any of the MetaWorld bits. The MetaWorld version was edited down and cropped in places, but it was the same video. Reid did not make it, nor was it an example of anything he had built in MetaWorld.</p><p>I brought this information to Reid’s attention.</p><p>“Are you talking about promo videos?” he asked. I responded that I meant the videos on the MetaWorld website and YouTube channel, which we’d been discussing for a few minutes.</p><p>“Oh cool promo videos, yeah yeah yeah,” he said. “Right on, yeah, you’re talking about the promo videos.”</p><p>I clarified, “This one’s called, ‘Generative plus Procedural design Redwood Creek.’”</p><p>“Yeah, we&#39;re showing the power of Unreal Engine,” Reid said.</p><p>“So that’s not you?” I asked. “That’s not MetaWorld?”</p><p>“We’re showing the power of Unreal in our videos on YouTube,” Reid responded.</p><p>I then questioned Reid about a second video published on the MetaWorld YouTube channel on October 31st, this one called “Designing MetaWorld.” It was just five seconds long and showed a windswept valley, long grass blowing in the digital breeze. In reality, this upload was a snippet from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvcBBa3X4js&amp;t=10s">a longer video by Joe Garth</a>, posted in June and with more than 1 million views.</p><p>Reid repeated the argument that these videos were examples of the tools that would be used to build MetaWorld.</p><p>“As an industry we’ve been using these tools, this is a pretty common toolset that much of the industry has had access to — is there something different when we do it?” Reid said. “So I hear that a lot, ‘I hope this isn’t an asset flip.’ Well, no, we’re showing you what’s possible and we’re using the same pipelines and assets that everybody else is using. I find that interesting, that when we use assets, it’s a problem. But Joe Schmo white dude uses assets, nobody says anything. I feel like there’s a double standard. It’s frankly kind of annoying at this point.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/be6e98a0-5880-11ec-bffe-71cb3e174577" alt="MetaWorld assets NFT" data-uuid="f7ba1312-e0fb-3dae-b1b0-8bb65aa941d6"><figcaption>An image on an NFT that sold for $374 appears to have been sourced from an artist&#39;s ArtStation page.

On November 16th, the<a href="https://www.themetaworld.org/land/esselen-redwoods"> MetaWorld website was updated</a> with new assets and a fresh video called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZLWLkHgVDc">Esselen Redwoods</a>,” which was branded with Reid’s white-and-blue MetaWorld logo. It appears this walkthrough was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPHf71VCWsY">originally uploaded by Simon Barle</a>, an environment artist at DICE, back in 2015, as “Redwood Forest UE4.” The accompanying assets seem to be taken from Barle’s original work as well.</p><p>Reid is using these lifted images to sell land as NFTs on the official MetaWorld website and in cryptocurrency marketplaces. He’s advertising two different environments, Esselen Creek and Esselen Islands, and apparently using misappropriated assets for both. The Esselen Creek images seem to be Barle’s, while a new video titled “MW Esselen Creek Promo 1 1” appears to be a chopped-up version of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OR7atuOfCVI">this 2017 upload by MAWI United</a>.

The original image comes from a ready-to-render scene pack containing Photoshop files based on the Farnsworth House, including foliage, furniture and high-quality textures that Reid definitely did not make himself.<a href="https://www.themetaworld.org/pianohouse11"></a>Another page for the Piano House NFT, which has since been removed, showed 3D renders of an entirely different property, <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/799390/piano-house-line-architects">LINE Architects’ Piano House</a>.</p><p>Reid has a clear <em>modus operandi</em> when it comes to advertising MetaWorld: find other people’s images and videos of impressive Unreal Engine environments, edit out the original watermarks, and present them as his own. Meanwhile, Reid has never provided any evidence that MetaWorld has ever looked like any of these assets.</p><p>This entire land-acquisition model dates back to the 2003 game <em>Second Life</em> and has recently been popularized in NFT form by Decentraland and similar platforms, with Decentraland’s virtual economy valued in billions of dollars. When it comes to the Esselen NFTs, the issue is that as far as we can tell, the MetaWorld Reid’s been promising has never existed at all.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a97db9d0-5880-11ec-af5e-fa17bfd80960" alt="MetaWorld assets" data-uuid="c8293557-47e3-310c-a70d-6167244ac486"><figcaption>The Esselen Islands landscape is seemingly taken from the Unreal Engine marketplace.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>In that Clubhouse monologue on November 5th, Reid claimed MetaWorld was already live, and had been for a few years.</p><p>“The other unique aspect of this world is the sheer size of it,” he said. “It exists in the cloud. We pushed it to cloud a couple years ago, and it&#39;s been kind of living and breathing on its own. There&#39;s sort of an AI operating system, if you will, kind of a world-operating system that manages the world and generates the land.”</p><p>This differs from the messaging Reid provided in interviews with Engadget. Reid had difficulty answering standard questions about the revamped MetaWorld, including how the project was being funded, what he’d actually built, where it was hosted, how he planned to sustain this massive world, and how many players he had.</p><p>After saying he was “not sure” how many players were active in MetaWorld, I asked, “Like dozens of people, hundreds of people?”</p><p>“So, I don’t know,” Reid said, before talking for a few minutes about the scope of the project, repeatedly calling it a “moonshot” for his main company, HelloVR. HelloVR seems to exist mainly as a LinkedIn page, with Reid and “Meta Bot” as the only two employees. Reid is listed as CEO. Reid in our interviews has said he works alone with contractors but also recently claimed to have a “partner.”</p><p>When confronted with the misleading nature of his assets or the discrepancies in his pitch, Reid responded with a singular argument: This was just another example of racism in the technology industry.</p><p>“It’s YouTube — am I missing something?” Reid said. “Is YouTube not a place to share videos? So again, there’s an issue when we share videos, but the nature of YouTube is to share videos, everyone else gets a pass?”</p><p>Reid isn’t wrong that the technology sector is dominated by heterosexual, cisgender, white men, and the industry has only recently begun recognizing and reckoning with this imbalance. That’s one of the reasons I was initially excited to interview Reid all those years ago; he was a Black developer in VR and his project sounded amazing. Only once I started asking questions, a lot of Reid’s ideas didn’t add up. And now he’s back with the same approach, but he’s specifically targeting people of color, which he knows is an underserved community.</p><p>“It doesn&#39;t sit right with me that he&#39;s selling this as being a ‘Black-owned’ project,” Morgan said. “I have this terrible feeling that he&#39;s using that to try and protect himself from backlash, because anyone who would go to attack him there could be labeled as racist.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="d3fe0a940fda4b7f9f7e03fc81d772bc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1a28b400-58db-11ec-b6ff-88797b4999e5" alt="Section header with the title "></section><p>On Clubhouse and Discord, Reid regularly presents himself as a hyper-intelligent tech entrepreneur with ideas guaranteed to change the world. In interviews with Engadget, however, he acts confused by basic concepts like YouTube uploads, copyright and IP theft.</p><p>“If they come across as disingenuous, oops!” Reid said about his YouTube history. “Like, all right, but that wasn’t the intent, we can sort of learn from that. The last thing we want to do is like, piss a bunch of people off.”</p><p>The original MetaWorld server is filled with people who could be accurately described as “pissed off.” Many of them bought land the first time around and ended up requesting refunds, citing Reid’s inconsistent messaging and lack of results over a period of years.</p><p>One investor who asked to remain anonymous, called Kris here, said they joined MetaWorld in 2018 because they loved VR and wanted to support small, innovative developers. Kris spent at least $60 on virtual land and defended Reid in the original Discord server until the day he disappeared.</p><p>“The vision of sharing an open world with people who want to build something big catches me every time,” Kris said. “It would be so great if a game comes that includes what MetaWorld promised. ...We planned a whole city, we were very deep into this and really hoped that we could someday visit ... but after a while a lot of people asked for refunds, day after day, with no response from Dedric. After he wrote that last message there wasn’t a Dedric anymore, and all hope was gone.”</p><p>Another investor who asked for anonymity, whom we’ll call Ryan, joined MetaWorld as an escape from their real-world anxieties. Ryan is disabled, and saved for a VR headset before discovering MetaWorld in 2018.</p><p>“I was looking desperately to find something to just change the boredom of life,” Ryan told Engadget. “My life sucks. I&#39;ve got a heart failure complicated with a bunch of other stuff right now, and I just can&#39;t get out and do things in the real world.”</p><p>Ryan shared receipts of all of their purchases with Engadget, alongside chat logs with Reid and an account called “Metabot,” which was controlled by Reid at least part of the time. Both reassured Ryan over the course of several months that all was well with MetaWorld.</p><p>“At first, even though I was concerned, I was still hoping that the project would happen,” Ryan said. “I tried to be patient.”</p><p>In total, Ryan spent almost $300 on passports, land, property and virtual currency. They never directly asked for a refund from Reid. By the time Ryan thought to do so, they saw multiple people had tried and failed to get their money back, and it didn’t seem worth the stress.</p><p>“I felt like I had been scammed, and was embarrassed,” Ryan said. “Due to the nature of a scam, I didn’t feel that there was a point. I was not getting answers in DMs … so I just gave up.” Ryan later heard from another community member about Somnium’s refund offer, and recouped his money from that company.</p><p>“Dedric and his group, I don&#39;t know who&#39;s responsible, mostly it bothered me a lot because they took advantage of me,” Ryan said. They continued, “They apparently don’t care for anybody except themselves … I lost a little faith at that time.”</p><p>These days, Ryan said they only use their VR headset for <em>Beat Saber</em> exercise, but they’ve found some friends and community in the MMO <em>Dual Universe</em>.</p><p>In a five-hour Discord call with the MetaWorld community in September 2018 (yes, <em>five hours</em>), Reid dodged probing questions from investors and made more bold claims. For one, he said MetaWorld was on track to launch in beta at the end of the summer, which was just three days away. A few callers chuckled and made snide comments at this goal, clearly in disbelief.</p><p>“Yeah, we&#39;re pushing for it to start next week,” Reid responded. “What&#39;s so funny about that?”</p><p>MetaWorld did not go live at the end of that summer. Of all the investors we spoke with, none of them received a refund from Reid.</p><p>As it stands in 2021, Reid still doesn’t seem to understand why anyone from the original round would want their money back, and he remains confused by the definition of “a refund.” This is years after Somnium Space facilitated refunds to some angry MetaWorld backers.</p><p>“This narrative of like, there&#39;s been anything disingenuous, is like nonsense, right?” Reid told Engadget this year. “It doesn&#39;t make any sense. Like, that doesn&#39;t necessarily fit into, as a leader of the project, my narrative, right? So like, yeah, so there&#39;s a lot of confusion around like, what a refund is. But like, the whole concept of refund was created by the folks over at Somnium.”</p><p>For early investors like Fischer, Kris, Ryan and Morgan, Reid’s stream-of-consciousness, nonsense-tinged responses are all-too familiar.</p><p>“I’m still mad about the whole thing, that one guy can do a scam on the web without consequences, it looks like he doesn’t even care,” Kris said. “Just think about some kids pumping their money in there for nothing, just an old man doing scams. That’s pretty sad.”</p><p>Reid is currently pitching the vague idea of MetaWorld on Clubhouse, Discord, Twitter and YouTube, and he said people are buying in (though exactly how many, he’s not sure). His NFT marketplace full of misappropriated assets is live, and so far, he’s raised more than $11,000. It&#39;s impossible to know how much Reid made from the initial backers, but at its height the first MetaWorld Discord had around 2,000 users, according to an ex-moderator we spoke with.</p><p>A Trello board linked on the new MetaWorld site serves as a roadmap for development and NFT drops, and current goals include a “land client” due February 14th, 2022, and “social simulation testing” due March 2022, complete with “Spatial OS Unreal Engine 5 support pending.”</p><p>Improbable, the company that runs SpatialOS, has no idea what Reid means by this claim. In a statement to Engadget, Marine Boulot, Improbable’s VP of PR and Communications, said, “Improbable has never had a commercial relationship with HelloVR/MetaWorld … neither HelloVR nor MetaWorld have any right or licence to use SpatialOS beyond any legacy prototyping kits they might have had access to years ago.”</p><p>Put simply, Reid does not have access to SpatialOS to build the game as he’s selling it.</p><p>It doesn’t end there: The quotes attributed to Engadget on the MetaWorld website and Reid&#39;s Clubhouse profile are fiction. One of them is credited to a writer that&#39;s never worked for Engadget.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5787d6d0-5879-11ec-bbbe-3f1fa0bc4e47" alt="MetaWorld quotes" data-uuid="cf09acb5-b696-39d4-aa0b-01b4250ab1aa"><figcaption>Misattributed quotes on the MetaWorld website and Reid&#39;s Clubhouse profile.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The original MetaWorld Discord server is still active — more active than the new, official one, even — and it’s filled with folks looking for closure and a way to warn potential investors about the lies they say they’ve encountered in Reid’s universe. Reid never shut down that server, saying he was hacked and lost access to the email account associated with it years ago, and adding that Discord had ignored his request for assistance.</p><p>A former member provided proof that Reid had access to his MetaWorld email account in April 2020, seven months after he last posted in the Discord server. At this point, that’s barely a surprise.</p><p>“He promised us this special, unique world where anything was possible,” Morgan said. “That we could build out our dreams in this place with no limits… and then just took our money and lashed out when we asked for updates or help. We were promised villages and towns with our own governance, that we could have full control over our collectives. I was really looking forward to making that persistent safe space where anyone was welcome.”</p><p>That seems to be exactly what the people in the new MetaWorld server want, too.</p><p>“Im not going anywhere,” a user called KBOT wrote on November 7th. “I support @dedricreid and @themetaworld completely!”</p><p>Meanwhile, in the old MetaWorld server on November 8th, user Kuma posted, “Please please please. Everyone with real evidence, expose him. He’s gaining loads of traction.”</p><p>For now, it’s a tale of two servers, with a vast digital paradise hanging in the balance — or not, depending on which channel you’re in.</p><p><em>Additional reporting by Aaron Souppouris, Executive Editor, and Nick Summers, who was a Senior Reporter at Engadget until early 2021.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metaworld-nft-metaverse-dedric-reid-clubhouse-discord-170052007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8ca6a6f-a177-4cae-988e-f32dc67f4efb</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Dec 2021 17:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639154607</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T16:43:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/99b33170-5848-11ec-befc-49d83b88b040" width="2560" height="1310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/99b33170-5848-11ec-befc-49d83b88b040" width="2560" height="1310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metaverse NFT art]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metaverse NFT art]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Retro online gaming service Piepacker adds five Atari classics to catalog]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://piepacker.com/index.html#root">Piepacker</a> has <a href="https://twitter.com/piepacker/status/1468943802136154120?s=20">added five Atari titles</a> to its catalog of retro games.
