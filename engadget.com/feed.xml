In the summer of 2022, the automaker will break ground on a facility about an hour east of Atlanta, Georgia, it <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-to-site-second-manufacturing-plant-in-georgia"><ins>announced on Thursday</ins></a>. Once the plant is complete sometime in 2024, the company hopes to eventually produce 400,000 electric vehicles there. It also plans to build a battery production facility nearby.</p><p>Rivian says the EV facility will cost approximately $5 billion to build and will employ more than 7,500 employees. The company will pay for it with proceeds from its recent November 10th IPO. Once complete, the facility will significantly boost Rivan’s manufacturing capacity. The automaker claims its first and currently only factory in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">Normal, Illinois</a> can produce about 150,000 cars annually. It plans to eventually manufacture about 200,000 there every year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That might seem like a lot but Rivian is still in the process of scaling production and meeting demand for its vehicles. As of December 15th, 2021, the company said it had produced 652 of its R1 vehicles. As of that same day, it had a total of 71,000 pre-orders from customers. It also needs to produce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">at least 100,000</a> trucks for Amazon.

Right after Mark Zuckerberg delivered a meandering keynote extolling the benefits of the metaverse, the company revealed it had repainted its iconic “thumbs up” sign that sits at its headquarters in Menlo Park. Many of its social media accounts also switched over, from Facebook to Meta.</p><p>Except for one key account, that is. As many pointed out at the time, the company didn’t control the @Meta handle on Instagram. It belonged to a small Denver-based magazine <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/"><ins>called </ins><em><ins>META</ins></em></a>. The day of Facebook’s announcement, the company, which publishes lifestyle stories about motorcycles, posted a photo of assorted print issues with the caption <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlb1pZlmvc/">“Since 2014.”</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That evening, recent posts from the @Meta account were filled with comments encouraging the owner to “hold” the account, or at least sell it for a high price. “Hold and sell high,” one user wrote. But by the next day, the account had mysteriously vanished, as <em>Quartz </em><a href="https://qz.com/2081386/facebook-has-the-meta-handle-on-twitter-but-not-instagram/"><ins>reported</ins></a>. It’s unclear exactly what happened, but @Meta has now subsumed all the content from the previous @Facebook Instagram page. Posts on the account predate October 28th, as if the social network had always controlled it. Posts from <em>META</em>, the magazine, now appear under the @readmeta handle.</p><p><em>META </em>the publisher didn’t respond to requests for comment. But there are still signs of its former Instagram account on its website. The company’s website still links to its old instagram.com/meta account. Oddly, clicking on that link from the publisher’s website turns up an error, even though it links to the same URL as the now Facebook-owned Meta account.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/154e38c0-5ea7-11ec-bffe-3f024dd95e59" style="height:873;width:1440;" alt="The magazine&#39;s website still links to instagram.com/meta but the link doesn&#39;t work anymore." data-uuid="8b3020e8-c132-3362-bd34-fa87b0b0a9d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Engadget</div></figure><p>On Tuesday, Ben Geise, <em>META</em>’s co-founder and editor-in-chief, announced that the magazine’s most recent issue would be the last under the name it had used for more than eight years. “We value our individuality above all else, so when the news broke that a corporate Goliath was changing its name to Meta, it felt like a punch to the gut,” he wrote in a <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/blog/keep-on-rolling"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. “With the flip of a switch our identity was suddenly watered down, and we watched our name circle the drain and wash away with something we had no control over.”</p><p>Geise didn’t respond to requests for comment, so it’s difficult to know exactly what happened. But Instagram’s terms of service state that businesses are unable to “reserve” handles. And the terms stipulate that companies can’t claim trademark violations if the account owner is using it for an unrelated purpose. “Using another&#39;s trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a violation of Instagram&#39;s trademark policy,” the policy <a href="https://help.instagram.com/101826856646059"><ins>states</ins></a>. “Instagram usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.”</p><p>Of course, accounts and handles often trade hands anyway. Businesses have been known to use escrow services to negotiate account transfers, while others have used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bans-hundreds-accounts-ogusers-takedown-201528230.html"><ins>shadier marketplaces</ins></a> to gain access to accounts with desirable handles.</p><p>But the practice is also <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"><ins>officially prohibited</ins></a> by Instagram’s terms of service. “You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service,” the terms of service states. “This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.”</p><p>That raises questions about whether Facebook skirted its own rules in order to gain access to a coveted username, the kind of action other users are routinely banned for.

This week, the automaker unveiled the <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467">Mobile Eccentric Droid</a> or MobED, a new mobility platform for taking on even the trickiest surfaces and uneven ground.</p><div id="a8a360297fd540b9a29dffbb2bb1994a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzV-GI7n1GI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company’s Robotics Lab says it developed MobED to overcome the limitations of existing indoor and service robots. Each of the robot’s wheels features independent power and steering control systems that allow it to rotate in place and move in any direction. It also has an eccentric drive system, hence the name, that allows it to independently adjust the height of each of its wheels. As you can see from the video, that means it can provide a stable platform for something as delicate as glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>MobED can expand its wheelbase up to about 25 inches when it needs as much stability as possible. It can also contract to about 17 inches when it finds itself in more complex environments. All told, the platform is approximately 26 inches long, 23 inches wide and 13 inches tall. A 2 kWh battery allows the robot to drive for approximately four hours on a single charge.</p><p>Outside of working as a service robot, Hyundai envisions MobED helping out in places like the movie industry where film crews could mount their equipment to the platform. It could also be used for deliveries and other purposes where stability is essential. We’ll get a chance to see more of the robot when Hyundai demos it at CES 2022 next month. However, the company hasn&#39;t said if it plans to commercialize MobED.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-mobed-annoucement-180932482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa53711f-324a-4d05-9145-99e26d02ad19</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 18:09:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639678176</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T18:09:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyundai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok is testing a desktop livestreaming app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> is getting into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html">livestreaming</a> from desktops.

Some increases are modest, such as for Optimo Mas and Choice ($4 and $5 respectively), but grandfathered users subscribed to tiers like Ultimate or Premier will pay $10 more per month.</p><p>The move raises the base pricing of DirecTV&#39;s Stream Choice to $90 per month, while Premier will cost $150 per month. Satellite customers won&#39;t be immune to increases, either. Outside of minimum service and ChineseDirect Plus, you&#39;ll see increases on January 23rd between $1 (for most Basic and Family plans) to $10 (for Max and Plus). And while some regional sports fees are dropping in price, there&#39;s now a fifth, $12 per month tier on top of the previous $10 maximum. You may see a price drop or increase depending on your ZIP code.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm wasn&#39;t shy about its reasoning. While hikes like these are frequently pinned on steeper programming costs, DirecTV said &quot;higher-than normal inflation&quot; from suppliers was also to blame. It costs more to offer service, and the company is passing on at least some of those costs to its customers.</p><p>These increases are common in the TV industry, and that includes streaming rivals. Hulu recently revealed it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-live-tv-disney-plus-bundle-price-hike-202004930.html">raise its Live TV pricing</a> by $5, and YouTube TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-price-increase-more-channels-175322450.html">now costs $65</a> per month where it started at just $35. DirecTV is relatively expensive, though, and the higher prices might not help matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/directv-streaming-price-increase-172851654.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f571a1d-dde7-42ac-8a5f-7baeb0c59f11</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:28:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639675735</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T17:29:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e8a5f10-5e8f-11ec-af89-6dace8b0baae" width="5360" height="3573" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e8a5f10-5e8f-11ec-af89-6dace8b0baae" width="5360" height="3573" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FEDERICO PARRA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[View of DirecTV broadcast satellite service provider logo at its headquarters in Caracas on May 19, 2020. - US telecommunications giant AT&T announced on Tuesday its "immediate" withdrawal from the pay television market in Venezuela, where it offered the DirecTV satellite platform, due to the impossibility of complying with the legal requirements of both countries.

It notes that, while videos about loneliness or weight loss might not violate the platform&#39;s rules, those kinds of videos could have a negative impact if they make up most of what a user sees on the For You page. So, preventing that from happening is important.</p><p>&quot;Our goal is for each person&#39;s For You feed to feature a breadth of content, creators, and topics,&quot; TikTok said, noting that too many similar videos appearing in the feed doesn&#39;t reflect the kind of experience it wants to foster. The service is consulting with its Content Advisory Council and the community, as well as experts from the fields of medicine, clinical psychology and AI ethics.</p><p>In addition, TikTok is developing an option that will let users block videos linked to certain words or hashtags on the For You page.

A spokesperson confirmed to Engadget that Sidewalk Labs products will be folded into Google, though Alphabet plans to spin out Canopy Buildings as a separate company.</p><p>&quot;Starting next year, Sidewalk products Pebble, Mesa, Delve, and Affordable Electrification will join Google, becoming core to Google’s urban sustainability product efforts,&quot; Doctoroff wrote. &quot;These products will continue to be led by Sidewalk Labs President of Urban Products Prem Ramaswami and Chief Technology Officer Craig Nevill-Manning, both Google alumni, and the teams will continue to execute on their vision and serve customers.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pebble is a vehicle sensor system designed to manage curb and parking space, and Delve is centered around bolstering real estate development with the help of AI. Mesa sensors are designed to help save energy, while Affordable Electrification is about managing home energy use. Canopy Buildings, meanwhile, focuses on &quot;factory-automated mass timber construction.&quot;</p><p>Doctoroff started Sidewalk Labs within Google six years ago and it later became its own company under the wing of Alphabet. In October 2017, Sidewalk Labs announced plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-16-alphabet-google-sidewalk-labs-toronto-quayside.html">build a smart neighborhood on Toronto&#39;s waterfront</a>. Quayside would have featured, among other things, delivery robots and an array of sensors to manage things like noise, traffic and pollution.</p><p>However, Sidewalk Labs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabets-sidewalk-labs-abandons-smart-neighborhood-project-in-toronto-201246140.html">shut down</a> the project in May last year. Doctoroff said at the time that “unprecedented economic uncertainty” as a result of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-sidewalk-quayside-waterfront-toronto-technical-evaluation.html">other compromises</a> it would have to make meant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-29-sidewalk-labs-site-plan-smart-neighborhood-quayside-toronto.html">its vision</a> for Quayside was no longer viable. The company also advised on development projects across North America.</p><p>Several companies were spun out of Sidewalk Labs, including Cityblock Health, which aims to reinvent health care for underserved communities; Replica, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-sidewalk-labs-replica-series-a-funding.html">a controversial data collection project</a> which aims to revamp transportation planning; and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cavnue-michigan-corridor-221520625.html">Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners</a>, which Doctoroff says &quot;pioneered new forms of tech-enabled infrastructure.&quot;</p><p>Doctoroff said he&#39;s stepping aside after doctors determined it was likely that he has ALS or Lou Gherig&#39;s Disease. He&#39;s focusing on spending more time with his family and fighting the condition. In 2010, Doctoroff started an organization focused on building a new, collaborative approach to ALS research after the deaths of his father and uncle, who had both been diagnosed with the disease.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sidewalk-labs-products-google-alphabet-151740698.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a2f2f16e-2bbd-4c55-8109-a2bb4d8b2ff4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:17:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639675164</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T17:19:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d5c5e0b0-5e81-11ec-ae5e-5d54fad6f8bc" width="1770" height="1016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d5c5e0b0-5e81-11ec-ae5e-5d54fad6f8bc" width="1770" height="1016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sidewalk Labs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration showing Sidewalk Labs' vision of a smart city.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sidewalk Labs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixelmator Photo's in-depth image editing comes to the iPhone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pixelmator Photo has been available for pros and enthusiasts who want to work with photos on their iPads, and now it&#39;s an option in their pockets.

That&#39;s double the RAM in the base model and a configuration that&#39;s not as readily available at third-party retailers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/QO0AyP" id="d881f3d6424a4973b610b0179c210cec" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Mac Mini M1 (16GB RAM) at Adorama - $799</a><p>You can still get the desktop with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB of storage" href="https://amzn.to/33fEvp8">512GB of storage</a> for $750 at Amazon if you prefer to bulk up on storage. But extra RAM can be quite useful as it&#39;ll help make multitasking smoother. Base on our experience testing out other M1 machines like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air</a>, the Mac Mini M1 should already feel speedy and smooth thanks to the performance gains brought by Apple&#39;s updated chipset. It has an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, plus a Neural Engine for handling machine-leaning tasks. Adding extra RAM into the mix will only improve the experience, especially when doing things like video editing, running dozens of browser tabs and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The latest Mac Mini is all about the performance enhancements, which is to say that it doesn&#39;t look all that different from previous models. It&#39;s designed to be compact so it should fit in even the most cramped work-from-home spaces, and it has a number of ports including two USB-A ports, two Thunderbolt ports, an HDMI port, an Ethernet port and a headphone jack. It&#39;s a good option for those who don&#39;t have a lot of space but want to invest in an upgraded, all-purpose machine for their home.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-with-16gb-of-ram-is-100-off-right-now-135015213.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">36c8afff-4839-422f-816d-58f417f40d3a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 13:50:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639662211</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T13:43:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's newest AirPods fall back to an all-time low of $140]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You now have another chance to grab <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple&#39;s third-gen AirPods" href="https://amzn.to/3ywCWyO">Apple&#39;s third-gen AirPods</a> for $140 on Amazon if you missed the sale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-third-gen-airpods-all-time-low-amazon-134518480.html">last week</a>. That&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the wireless earbuds, which originally retailed for $179 and which Apple has been selling for $150 over the past few days. While the model is currently in stock, make sure to check your estimated delivery dates before you decide to buy it as a Christmas gift, because it may arrive after the holidays even if you purchase it right now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ywCWyO" id="8a99d255e35b4d708e2b5f3c404a8700" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy New Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) at Amazon - $140</a><p>If you don&#39;t mind the possibility that your order might arrive after the holidays and have been looking to buy a pair of AirPods in the first place, the third-gen model is a great buy. While it still doesn&#39;t come with the Pro&#39;s silicone buds, it represents a complete redesign for the product line. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">review</a>, where we gave it a score of 88, we found it more comfortable than its predecessors due to its new &quot;contoured design.&quot; It&#39;s shorter than previous models and can direct sounds better into your ear, leading to massive improvements to its audio quality.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also paired a custom driver with a high-dynamic-range amplifier to produce &quot;rich consistent bass&quot; and &quot;crisp, clean&quot; sounds that improve audio quality even further, making it more immersive than before. And, thanks to the H1 chip, the third-gen AirPods feature Adaptive EQ, spatial audio, one-touch fast pairing and always-on Siri. Finally, we praised the model for its battery life: The earbuds themselves can last for six hours, and the case can extend your listening time for up to 30 hours total.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/citroen/press/ready-for-adventure-citroen-my-ami-buggy-concept-embodies-ami-s-vision-of-leisure?adobe_mc_ref=">My Ami Buggy</a> is based on the Ami we all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-citroen-ami-ev-133032057.html">know and love</a>, but adds some practical and stylistic touches like wider knobby tires, an LED light bar and removable canvas doors.&nbsp;</p><p>The buggy is mainly a way for Citroën&#39;s designers to show off their chops by adding &quot;stylish attributes to assert its intrepid and friendly backpacker personality,&quot; according to the company. As such, they drew inspiration from things like construction games, industrial design and fashion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="29ec319dae494199a7609f7eb684cae4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuXIh2dTA8k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To be sure, it looks like your ten-year-old&#39;s idea of a buggy, assuming the kid had some design talent. The khaki, black and yellow color scheme is the first attention-grabbing feature, giving it an outdoorsy camouflage feel and yet high visibility.</p><p>Another key feature is the doors, or lack thereof. The regular ones have been replaced by removable canvas doors with zippers, bringing some much-needed air circulation and buggy allure. The knobbier and wider tires will let you take it onto rougher roads, as long as you remember that ground clearance isn&#39;t amazing. It also has headlight protectors and a spare knobby tire mounted on the roof that add a &quot;spirit of adventure&quot; and ratchet up the cuteness factor.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/16d0b580-5e64-11ec-afbb-a3e6e165a820" alt="Citro&#xeb;n has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept" data-uuid="95246f38-969d-35ff-8bd8-57080f710d89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Copyright maison-vignaux @ Continental Productions</div></figure><p>Other additions include an LED lightbar, removable &quot;nomadic speaker,&quot; a roof cap to protect against the sun and a graphics package that includes the words &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;01&quot; on the driver&#39;s seat and &quot;Copilot&quot; and &quot;02&quot; on the passenger seat. It also offers thicker memory foam in the seats, new storage bins on the dashboard and even a range of luggage designed to &quot;fit perfectly into the vehicle&#39;s interior spaces,&quot; according to Citroën. Other features like  smartphone clamps, bottle holders and more were all built using 3D printing so that they can be reproduced on demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, the Ami can hit a top speed of 28 MPH and go 44 miles on its 5.5 kWh battery. It&#39;s also legal for teenagers 14 and older to drive in France and elsewhere in Europe. The company&#39;s designers must have had a lot of fun with the My Ami Buggy concept, but there&#39;s no word yet on whether Citroën will ever build and sell it — though the kid in all of us certainly hopes so.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/citroen-has-transformed-its-ami-ev-into-an-adorable-buggy-concept-123517763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73b2cac1-ff3c-4cf2-96eb-8965d994e282</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:35:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639660343</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T13:12:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Citroen]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
