The company has <a href="https://motional.com/news/motional-and-hyundai-motor-group-unveil-the-ioniq-5-robotaxi-motional-s-next-generation-robotaxi">revealed</a> that its first commercial robotaxi will be based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a>, adding self-driving hardware (cameras, LiDAR and radar) to the brand new EV. It&#39;ll also include in-cabin interfaces to give passengers some options during their ride, such as asking for an extra stop.</p><p>The crossover includes &quot;safety redundancies&quot; to keep critical systems running. Motional can also take remote control if the robotaxi doesn&#39;t know how to handle a given situation — likely necessary when this is a Level 4 self-driving car that can&#39;t quite operate autonomously under all conditions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The driverless Ioniq 5 will enter service in 2023 through Motional&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lyft-fully-driverless-cars-timeline-2023-motional-163854709.html">partnership with Lyft</a>. While it isn&#39;t surprising that Motional would pick a Hyundai car over previous examples (such as the BMWs Aptiv used), this might be an ideal fit — it&#39;s a roomy, zero-emissions car with a 300-mile range. That might also give Motional a slight edge over other manufacturer-linked robotaxi services, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html">GM&#39;s Cruise</a> (which currently relies on the smaller, shorter-ranged Bolt EV).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-motional-ioniq-5-robotaxi-140055037.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f8fe32e-73d5-401f-9e66-5350bc3fa7c4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630418058</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:54:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/90ca43d0-0a57-11ec-aff2-6160915f0072" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/90ca43d0-0a57-11ec-aff2-6160915f0072" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyundai/Motional]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV robotaxi for Motional]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hyundai Ioniq 5 EV robotaxi for Motional]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows 11 will be available on October 5th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After months of hype, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11</a> has a release date. Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">announced</a> that Windows 11 will be available on October 5th, both as a free upgrade for qualifying Windows 10 systems as well as new PCs shipping with the OS pre-installed.</p><p>Don&#39;t assume you&#39;ll get the upgrade on day one, though. This is a gradual rollout that will prioritize newer hardware and use &quot;intelligence models&quot; to determine who gets the upgrade first, including reliability and device age. All supporting machines will get the update by mid-2022, but this suggests you may be toward the back of the queue if you&#39;re using relatively old hardware. At least some shipping Windows 10 PCs will be on the fast track for Windows 11 updates, including models from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and (of course) Microsoft.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, though, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-154014628.html">Android app support</a> won&#39;t be available on launch. Microsoft now only expects to introduce the feature in a Windows Insider preview build sometime in the &quot;coming months.&quot; That&#39;s not completely shocking given the challenges of translating mobile apps to a mouse-and-keyboard experience, but this still means one of Windows 11&#39;s tentpole features won&#39;t be available for a long while.</p><p>The new platform centers on a refreshed interface with a new Start interface, Snap Layouts, widgets and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-microsoft-teams-integrated-153343398.html">Teams integration</a>. You&#39;ll also find a redesigned Microsoft Store that even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wants-steam-epic-in-windows-11-app-store-132411163.html">lets third-party stores operate</a> within its walls. Technology like DirectX 12, DirectStorage and Auto HDR also promise to help gamers.</p><p>This might not be Microsoft&#39;s smoothest launch, however. On top of the delayed Android feature, Microsoft sparked some confusion with relatively steep hardware requirements that have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">evolved over time</a> and include demands for security features like TPM 2.0. Microsoft will technically let you install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, but you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-updates-withheld-older-cpus-194632054.html">might be denied updates</a> unless you&#39;re willing to install new OS images on a frequent basis. Unlike Windows 10, then, you can&#39;t just assume your years-old computer will run this software without a hitch — there&#39;s a chance you&#39;ll have to upgrade your hardware first, even if it&#39;s still fast enough for your needs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a8e7ca4-5858-45d1-8f55-35c48bfc509e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:26:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630417747</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:49:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84855690-0a5d-11ec-af6b-3e6091b7d687" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84855690-0a5d-11ec-af6b-3e6091b7d687" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 on a Microsoft Surface Laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 on a Microsoft Surface Laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones have improved ANC and a familiar design]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bose introduced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-bose-qc35-headphones-google-assistant.html">QuietComfort 35 II</a> headphones back in 2017, and despite debuting the stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-16-bose-700-headphones-review.html">Bose 700</a> model in 2019, the company was adamant its QC line <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-qc35-ii-gaming-headset-150520136.html">wasn&#39;t going away</a>. Now the QC35 II has a proper replacement: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the QuietComfort 45" href="https://fave.co/3zzcUum">the QuietComfort 45</a>. Bose says these headphones &quot;maintain the hallmarks of their predecessor&quot; when it comes to audio quality, comfort, reliable controls and more. As you can see, the QC45 also keeps nearly the same design at the QC35 and QC35 II except for a few subtle changes. And at $329.95, they&#39;ll debut at a lower price than the previous two QuietComfort models.&nbsp;</p><p>While the company went with an updated look for the Bose 700, it largely maintained the aesthetic of the QuietComfort line for the QC45. Bose says it kept the design elements that made the QC35 and QC35 II &quot;an identifiable classic,&quot; but it got rid of the pleats on the earpads and closed some gaps to create &quot;smooth transitions.&quot; You should still expect these to be light and cozy as none of the changes should impact the QuietComfort&#39;s highly-regarded status as a travel companion. The QC45 still folds flat for ear storage, thanks to the return of rotating earcups and a hinged headband.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fdf58bd0-09ae-11ec-b995-20f55d0946b9" alt="Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones" data-uuid="7ff30a53-b068-399b-87cd-60ce49ab9e15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>On the inside is where the most notable changes lie. Bose says it improved the noise cancellation with the combination of internal and external microphones paired with a &quot;proprietary digital chip.&quot; The company explains that this setup can detect and silence more mid-range frequencies — things like the roar of train, office or coffee shop — when you activate Quiet mode. The QuietComfort 45 also has an Aware setting that offers full transparency to your environment. Unlike other Bose models, there&#39;s no level adjustment for the active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you just get the two aforementioned modes separately.&nbsp;</p><p>Those two audio settings are accessible via the QC45&#39;s on-board controls. There&#39;s a dedicated button for them on the left earcup that can also mute the mic during a call. All of the core functions — volume, play/pause, voice assistant, power and pairing — are on the right side. Like the previous models, they&#39;re all physical buttons instead of touch controls, so they should preform reliably.&nbsp;</p><p>Bose also extended the battery life with the QuietComfort 45. The company says you can expect up to 24 hours of listening time on a charge. That&#39;s up from 20 hours on the QC35 II. A quick-charge feature will give you three hours of listening time in 15 minutes and the QC45 charges via a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:QuietComfort 45 headphones" href="https://fave.co/3zzcUum">QuietComfort 45 headphones</a> will be available in black and light grey color options on September 23rd for $329.95.

Following the introduction of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-18-jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Elite 65t</a> in 2018, the company has been keen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">updating its lineup</a> every year or so. Today, it introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">three models</a>, including a new flagship noise-cancelling option with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the Elite 7 Pro" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">the Elite 7 Pro</a>. The successor to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">the comfy and capable 85t</a>, this version has a revamped design and smaller size, but all the best parts of previous Jabra earbuds remain. Perhaps most notably, the company is making big promises for improving calls with its new MultiSensor Voice tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The main point Jabra is driving home with the Elite 7 Pro is its &quot;ultimate call clarity.&quot; Almost every headphone company makes bold claims about voice performance and they very rarely pan out. You almost always end up sounding like you&#39;re on speaker phone. With this new model, Jabra says its MultiSensor Voice setup combines a bone conduction sensor that picks up the vibrations of your jaw with a set of four microphones and the company&#39;s &quot;intelligent algorithms.&quot; Jabra explains that the bone conduction sensor, or voice pick-up unit (VPU), kicks in when those algorithms detect certain types of noise from the mics — like wind, for example. The company&#39;s on-board tech then combines voice data from the sensor and the microphones &quot;to transmit the best call quality.&quot; Again, all of this is something we&#39;ll need to put to the test to properly judge its merits, but it&#39;s clear Jabra is trying to improve call audio as many of us continue to work remotely.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Jabra says the Elite 7 Pro is 16 percent smaller than its Elite 75t which was the company&#39;s most compact option thus far. Smaller earbuds typically lead to a more comfortable fit and since Jabra can lean on parent company GN&#39;s hearing aid expertise and library of over 62,000 ear scans, it has some insight on shape as well. The outside controls panel now outlines the entire earbud instead of being a perfect circle with a small elbow that extended out to hold the microphones. Jabra also redesigned the charging case, opting for a flatter pill-shaped aesthetic this time around.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b57e59d0-0a54-11ec-af9f-721ec170e9a1" alt="Jabra Elite 7" data-uuid="61129138-48f8-3d69-9f27-38a092678518"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>Through its Sound+ app, Jabra gives you lots of options for customization. Similar to previous models, active noise cancellation (ANC) is adjustable on the Elite 7 Pro, so you can dial in the level of distraction blocking you need. Jabra once again offers the ability to reconfigure the on-board buttons with its MyControls feature. The options here include volume, play/pause, skipping tracks, noise cancellation mode, access to a voice assistant and more. The company also provides a fit test (MyFit) to determine if you&#39;ve selected the correct ear tips for a proper seal. Should you need to adjust the overall audio profile, MySound can help with EQ tweaks.</p><p>Jabra says the Elite 7 Pro will last up to nine hours with ANC enabled. Turn it off and you can expect an additional two hours of use. The case holds just under three full charges, offering up to 35 total hours between it and the buds with noise cancellation on, or up to 42 total hours with ANC off. Dock the Elite 7 Pro for five minutes and you&#39;ll get just over an hour of listening time. Jabra also says this model can hit 50 percent battery levels with a half-hour charge. And for convenience, the Elite 7 Pro supports wireless charging for all the times you&#39;d rather just set down the case than mess with a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-jabra-elite-active-75t-hands-on.html">sporty versions</a> of true wireless models, Jabra is doing that once again with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Elite 7 Active" href="https://fave.co/3BuOWBk">Elite 7 Active</a>. These earbuds have a similar design to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Elite 7 Pro" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">Elite 7 Pro</a> and nearly all of the same features. ANC, HearThrough transparency mode, nine-hour battery life, wireless charging and IP57 waterproof rating are all here. The key differences are the Elite 7 Active doesn&#39;t have the Pro&#39;s MultiSensor Voice tech, but the sport model is made with a new material Jabra is calling ShakeGrip — a liquid silicone rubber that should help with the overall fit when you get sweaty.&nbsp;</p><p>The Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active will be available on October 1st for $200 and $180 respectively. The Elite 7 Pro comes in black, silver/black and gold/beige color options while the Elite 7 Active has black, navy and mint green versions. At $200, the the Elite 7 Pro is $30 cheaper than the Elite 85t when it debuted.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to these models, Jabra also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">announced the $79 Elite 3 today</a>. This affordable option doesn&#39;t have ANC or wireless charging, but it does offer a lot of features that make the company&#39;s earbuds worth considering. Those include seven-hour battery life, HearThrough transparency mode and both customizable EQ and on-board controls.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54f55be6-4e97-4fac-a17f-8dc9eee13b70</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630415185</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:06:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f7d1a40-09f7-11ec-bea2-161f0afb3cfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f7d1a40-09f7-11ec-bea2-161f0afb3cfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 7 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 7 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's latest tech makes AI voices more expressive and realistic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The voices on Amazon&#39;s Alexa, Google Assistant and other AI assistants are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-09-in-pursuit-of-the-perfect-ai-voice.html">far ahead</a> of old-school GPS devices, but they still lack the rhythms, intonation and other qualities that make speech sound, well, human. NVIDIA has unveiled new research and tools that can capture those natural speech qualities by letting you train the AI system with your own voice, the company announced at the <a href="https://www.interspeech2021.org/">Interspeech 2021</a> conference.&nbsp;</p><p>To improve its AI voice synthesis, NVIDIA’s text-to-speech research team developed a model called RAD-TTS, a winning entry at an NAB broadcast convention competition to develop the most realistic avatar. The system allows an individual to train a text-to-speech model with their own voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b719eee04b2348aa8e61d766e25777dc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RknIx6XmffA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Another RAD-TTS feature is voice conversion, which lets a user deliver one speaker&#39;s words using another person&#39;s voice. That interface gives fine, frame-level control over a synthesized voice’s pitch, duration and energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this technology, NVIDIA&#39;s researchers created more conversational-sounding voice narration for its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHnYvH1qtObE_PjzaAFqS_CpmumGx5cW">I Am AI video series</a> using synthesized rather than human voices. The aim was to get the narration to match the tone and style of the videos, something that hasn&#39;t been done well in many AI narrated videos to date. The results are still a bit robotic, but better than any AI narration I&#39;ve ever heard.</p><p>&quot;With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator’s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor — tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video’s tone,&quot; NVIDIA wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA is distributing some of this research — optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, of course — to anyone who wants to try it via open source through the NVIDIA NeMo Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI, available on the company&#39;s NGC hub of containers and other software.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidi-as-latest-tech-makes-ai-voices-more-expressive-and-realistic-130021480.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16b6335c-93e7-4064-bc26-9dacadddfc78</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630398920</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T08:35:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1b42b10-0a30-11ec-bf7f-c150e8837137" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1b42b10-0a30-11ec-bf7f-c150e8837137" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA natural voice]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA natural voice]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's new feature-packed Elite 3 true wireless earbuds are only $80]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to true wireless earbuds, Jabra consistently covers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">nearly all the bases</a>. The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">continued to improve</a> design, features and technology since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-18-most-versatile-headphones-jabra-elite-65t.html">the Elite 65t</a>, but there was one thing it was still missing: a low-cost model for around $100. That changes today as Jabra is announcing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:the Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/2WFvK4F">the Elite 3</a>: an $80 set of true wireless earbuds with more features than we typically see at this price.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the other two new models Jabra debuted today, the Elite 3 has a new design with smaller earbuds the company says are comfy enough for all-day wear. What&#39;s more, the buds are IP55 rated dust and water resistant so you won&#39;t have to worry about using them for workouts or if you get caught in the rain. Even with the lower price, you still get customizable on-board controls on each side with physical buttons instead of touch controls. Jabra gives you options like play/pause, track control, volume, voice assistant and one-touch access to Spotify. There&#39;s also the ability to activate HearThrough mode with a single press, the company&#39;s name for ambient sound. No on-board option for active noise cancellation (ANC) though because these earbuds only offer passive noise isolation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/93adbdb0-09f4-11ec-8eed-1dae46871acc" alt="Jabra Elite 3" data-uuid="982737c9-1cef-338b-91ca-a0c318227784"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>Jabra says it set out to build a more affordable set of earbuds that &quot;still offers exceptional sound quality.&quot; To do so, the company relies on 6mm drivers along with aptX support. The Elite 3 has four microphones for calls, so you can use them with Zoom between podcasts. They&#39;re compatible with Jabra&#39;s Sound+ app as well, which will allow you to dial in the EQ, customize the on-board controls and more. Plus, the Elite 3 works with Google Fast Pair on Android devices so setup there should be quick and easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Jabra says the Elite 3 will last up to seven hours with three additional charges in the case. A fast charge feature gives you up to an hour of use after 10 minutes in the case. When the time comes to top off the entire set, you&#39;ll need a USB-C cable as this model doesn&#39;t support wireless charging.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/2WFvK4F">Elite 3</a> will be available tomorrow (September 1st) from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">Jabra&#39;s website</a> and Amazon in dark grey, navy, beige and light purple color options for $79.99.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the Elite 3, Jabra also introduced a new flagship noise-cancelling model with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a>. There&#39;s a sport version of those earbuds as well (Elite 7 Active), but the Pro offers adjustable ANC, customizable controls, long battery life and wireless charging. It also has new tech that Jabra dubbed MultiSensor Voice the company says will improve your audio during calls and Zoom meetings. These two options are more expensive at $180 and $200, plus they won&#39;t be available until October 1st.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38e14c1e-e3b0-49bd-95a4-bbbe9253c7a3</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630415409</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:10:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6103c930-09c8-11ec-bfff-a017f2c36f8f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6103c930-09c8-11ec-bfff-a017f2c36f8f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Echo Show 5s are cheaper than ever starting at $45]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed the previous sale earlier this month, you have another chance to grab one of Amazon&#39;s Echo Show 5s for less.

Each have a 5.5-inch, 960 x 480 touchscreen that shows the time along with things like weather forecasts, news headlines and more. They are also capable of making video calls thanks to their built-in camera and mics, and if you have multiple Alexa devices in your home, the Show 5s can be part of your larger intercom system. And when you need more privacy, you can shutter the camera and flip a switch to turn off the microphone. The smaller display isn&#39;t ideal for streaming video, but you are able to do so if you wish, along with music, podcasts, audiobooks and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">Show 5</a> models shine as smart alarm clocks thanks to their sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens the screen 15 minutes before you&#39;re supposed to wake up, and tap-to-snooze function. Both also have an ambient light sensor that adjusts the screen&#39;s brightness depending on the light in your environment, so you&#39;ll never get woken up in the middle of the night by an ultra-bright display.</p><p>When it comes to differences between the first- and second-gen devices, there aren&#39;t many. The new Echo Show 5 has a 2MP camera, better than the 1MP camera in the first-gen, and it comes in a blue color in addition to the standard black and white options. Only those who plan on using the Show 5 to make video calls and drop in on family members would get the most out of the second-gen model — but when you can grab the latest version for only $10 more than the previous, it&#39;s not such a hard sell anymore.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-second-gen-echo-show-5-smart-display-sale-124330842.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa69b719-4da5-4457-b237-9b4e79cdee7c</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:43:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630416920</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:35:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2eb22170-07d0-11eb-a4f4-1fc4d6e97882" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2eb22170-07d0-11eb-a4f4-1fc4d6e97882" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s Echo Show 5s are cheaper than ever starting at $45]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netgear's 5G mobile hotspot router with WiFi 6 is now available for $700]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you often need to tether to get internet, Netgear has a very interesting new product — if you can afford it.

A few days ago, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html">report</a> by well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the next iPhones will come with support for Low Earth Orbit satellite calls and messages. Gurman&#39;s sources said, however, that Apple isn&#39;t turning its devices into actual satellite phones, at least for now. Instead, the tech giant is reportedly developing at least two emergency-related features relying on satellite networks.&nbsp;</p><p>The first feature is called Emergency Message via Satellite and will be added as a third protocol, alongside iMessage and SMS, to the Messages app. It&#39;s apparently codenamed Stewie inside the company and will allow users to text emergency services even when there&#39;s no signal, which sounds especially useful during emergencies in remote locations, such as mountains and forests.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool will also give users a way to text their emergency contacts simply by typing Emergency SOS in the recipient line. Messages will be restricted to a shorter length, but the senders&#39; contacts will get a notification for them even if their phone is set to Do Not Disturb. Satellite messages will appear as gray bubbles instead of blue or green so they can be easily identified. Eventually, the feature could handle phone calls, as well.</p><p>Apple is also reportedly working on a second satellite feature that will allow users to report crisis situations like plane crashes and fires. This system will give users a way to report the incident at length and will ask them specifics, such as if anybody needs search-and-rescue services or if anybody in the vicinity is armed. It can also automatically send authorities the reporter&#39;s location and their details from the Health app, such as their medical history, age, medications and information like height and weight. The feature can also a notify the reporter&#39;s emergency contacts for them.</p><p>While both features sound useful, their availability is restricted by satellite location and reach. They might not work for some regions, and in some cases, users may have to walk outdoors in a certain direction where their iPhone can connect to a satellite. Also, Gurman&#39;s sources said it&#39;s unlikely that the features will be ready before the year ends, which means the next iPhones expected be announced sometime in September won&#39;t be able to send messages via satellite yet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-rumored-iphone-satellite-support-emergency-calls-messages-092538075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32dfc42f-8593-412b-8fc2-4fb0cef23035</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 09:25:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630401962</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T09:26:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/687d08b0-0a32-11ec-b677-cabddceab0d0" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/687d08b0-0a32-11ec-b677-cabddceab0d0" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[oatawa via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bangkok, Thailand - Jan 13, 2021: Close up hand holding black smartphone iPhone 12 Pro Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Close up hand holding black smartphone iPhone 12 Pro Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max and YouTube are now available on Spectrum TV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spectrum TV has made major streaming service additions to its digital cable service and live TV app with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-smart-tv-app-overhaul-173225888.html">HBO Max</a> and YouTube, parent Charter has <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/hbo-max-and-youtube-launch-on-spectrum-tv-platform">announced</a>.

As of August 27th, the group called #AppleToo said it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/appletoo-500-toxic-workplace-issues-170013024.html">collected</a> 500 such stories — now, it has started publishing them on its <a href="https://medium.com/appletoo/appletoo-digest-1-39e489d8726b">official Medium page</a>. Cher Scarlett, an Apple security engineer and the face of the movement, wrote on Medium that she will share five stories at a time &quot;as the emotional toll in reading these is heavy.&quot;</p><p>Two of the first five are about sexual harassment, one of which involved a male boss using his position of power over a female employee. Later, that employee was kicked out of an interview after the hiring team realized who she was. Another story was from a Black retail worker in the UK who tried to get their bosses to do something about racism and micro aggressions in the workplace to no avail. A female employee talked about how she was targeted by a person in her team and how management didn&#39;t do anything about it. And the last one is about an employee who was assaulted in her store by a customer and didn&#39;t get support from management.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Scarlett publishes all the submissions she got, these are just five of the many we&#39;ll get to read. The #AppleToo movement said on Twitter, however, that 75 percent share a common theme: They involve some form of discrimination. Nearly half of them involve sexism, retaliation and HR reports that were ultimately dismissed. A fourth of them involved racism and ableism, and most of the harassment and assault stories were sexual in nature.&nbsp;</p><div id="b012abdce3c249539176120f7d03aae3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">75% of the stories we&#39;ve received involved some form of discrimination, and nearly half involved reports of sexism, retaliation, and HR reports that were dismissed. 1/4 involved racism or ableism.

If we’re going to have any chance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipcc-2021-climate-change-report-182200028.html">addressing climate change</a>, we’ll need to move away from burning fossil fuels in our cars. There’s just one problem with most electric vehicles: they depend on lithium-ion batteries made with heavy metals like cobalt. Not only is the material in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-19-earthworks-renewable-energy-metal-demand.html">short supply</a>, but it’s mined in a way that involves <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-19-apple-samsung-sony-amnesty-child-labor-drc.html">child labor</a> and the <a href="https://unctad.org/news/developing-countries-pay-environmental-cost-electric-car-batteries">destruction</a> of the environment. For those reasons, companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-ibm-research-ev-battery-cobalt-free.html">IBM</a>, Panasonic and Tesla have tried to make electric batteries without heavy metals.</p><p>So far, many of those efforts have yet to make it out of the lab, but a Chinese company called <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/svolt-unveils-worlds-first-series-production-cobalt-free-battery-to-be-assembled-in-vehicles-at-chengdu-motor-show-2021-301365031.html">SVOLT</a> claims it’s ready to start producing a cobalt-free battery at scale. At the Chengdu Motor Show, the firm showed off an 82.5KWh capacity power pack inside a vehicle from Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors. Under normal temperatures, SVOLT says its battery can deliver approximately 373 miles of range on a single charge and allow a car to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under five seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SVOLT said the battery is “expected” to make its way to cars that go on sale in the Chinese market but didn’t offer a timeline of when that might happen, nor did it say just how many cobalt-free power packs it can manufacture at the moment.

This triggered a voltage dip across the city, and two power plants and generators also went offline, forcing backup systems to come online. When trying to restore service, a power surge occurred. When this happened, the subway command center lost communications with 83 trains. The public address system also went down. Five trains with more than 550 people were stranded.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Part of the problem was the passengers themselves. While emergency personnel did evacuate as many people as they could, riders on two trains decided to leave cars on their own, a very dangerous act because tracks could be re-energized if a train was coming. Firefighters had to search the tracks to make sure there were no more remaining passengers before the subway could fully restore power.</p><p>After a phased “rolling restoration,” the system was finally back online at 1:30AM Monday morning.</p><p>Hochul has since ordered a deeper investigation into what exactly caused the surge as well as the other problems. So far, investigators have said there is no suspicion of terrorism or malicious actions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nyc-subway-mta-power-surge-194516628.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d6dcd567-6f01-4f22-801f-4a9fbe4d7ebe</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:45:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630380769</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T03:33:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5b24f2a0-09c8-11ec-8f4f-48223bfd26de" width="6848" height="4488" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5b24f2a0-09c8-11ec-8f4f-48223bfd26de" width="6848" height="4488" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gary Hershorn via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 2: A G train arrives at the Smith - 9th Street station in Brooklyn on August 2, 2021 in New York City.
