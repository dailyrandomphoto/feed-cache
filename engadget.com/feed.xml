There are almost too many enhancements to count, but some of the more notable ones have the potential to change how you use the service.</p><p>The first of those is an expansion of Zoom&#39;s automated closed captioning system. At the start of the year, Zoom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-automatic-closed-captions-all-users-fall-081631869.html">announced</a>&nbsp;it was making the feature available to all of its users by the fall of 2021. Now, the company plans to make it work in a total of 30 languages. It’s also adding live translation support for 12 languages. Both expansions will occur over the next year and come after the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-kites-real-time-machine-translation-184824115.html">bought a startup</a>&nbsp;that specializes in real-time translation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoom is also working on an expanded&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whiteboard/">Whiteboard experience</a>&nbsp;that will make the feature available on the web and outside of meetings and calls. To that end, you’ll find a separate Whiteboard tab once the experience rolls out in beta later this year. Then, sometime next year, Zoom plans to work with Facebook to bring its video conferencing software and Whiteboard feature to the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>&nbsp;to allow you to access them both in virtual reality.</p><p>Zoom is also working on several smaller but still notable features. For instance, support for end-to-end encryption is coming to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/e2ee-byok-verified-identity">Zoom Phone</a>, which will allow you to keep phone calls you make over Zoom secure. Check out the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-platform-enhancements-zoomtopia-2021/">company’s blog post</a>&nbsp;to see everything it’s working on at the moment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-live-captions-expansion-173233882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d035ddab-088b-4464-8e26-74fad6c46935</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:32:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631554355</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T17:32:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3c053e30-14b7-11ec-bfdd-2e9e68891d24" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3c053e30-14b7-11ec-bfdd-2e9e68891d24" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom Whiteboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom Whiteboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch now syncs with Tempo's AI-powered home gym]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://v2.tempo.fit/">Tempo</a> has rolled out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-apple-watch-se-is-on-sale-for-240-right-now-124054898.html">Apple Watch</a> integration for its AI-powered home gym, giving users an easy way to track their heart rate during workouts without the need for a dedicated HR monitor. Upon syncing the wearable, users can also view other data on it, including how many calories they burned during studio classes, the total volume of weights they lifted and their ranking on the leaderboard.</p><p>The company says 70 percent of its users own an iPhone, and 35 percent from that group has an Apple Watch. With that in mind, rolling out Apple integration for its product is a no-brainer. In addition to being able to view stats and data, syncing their Watch will also give users the capability to pause and resume classes, as well as to manage their workouts, without having to walk up to the smart home gym&#39;s touchscreen panel.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tempo launched its Studio home gym cabinet, which includes a touchscreen panel, a 3D camera track workouts, weights and other equipment, in early 2020. The pandemic brought about a need for home workout solutions as gyms around the world closed down, and Tempo was one of the companies that experienced a surge in demand. In April, the company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/13/home-gym-startup-tempo-raises-220m-to-meet-surge-in-demand-for-its-workout-device/">raised</a> $220 million in funding to be able to keep up with an increasing number of orders and give its research and development efforts a boost.</p><p>Those who already have a Tempo Studio and want to sync it with an Apple Watch will have to make sure both devices, along with their iPhone, are connected to the same WiFi network. All three have to be near each other, as well. After they&#39;ve logged into their profile on the Tempo Studio and download the app for the Watch, they only need to follow the steps laid out on their iPhone.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tempo-ai-powered-home-gym-integration-173057957.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7c62851-75a2-42f8-ac34-8afc99842c46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:30:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631355014</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T10:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/aaa45cd0-12e2-11ec-a5de-3b99156dc993" width="1270" height="715" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/aaa45cd0-12e2-11ec-a5de-3b99156dc993" width="1270" height="715" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony permanently shuts down LittleBigPlanet's PS3 and Vita servers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has permanently shut down the online services for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/littlebigplanet"><ins>LittleBigPlanet</ins></a> games on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita after &quot;extended downtime.&quot; As such, online multiplayer and community levels are no longer available for <em>LittleBigPlanet, LittleBigPlanet 2, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-18-littlebigplanet-3-review-knitting-lessons.html"><em><ins>LittleBigPlanet 3</ins></em></a> (on PS3) and <em>LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</em>.

The developers have updated the PS4 version of <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and that game&#39;s servers are back online. Players once again have access to more than 10 million community levels, including all of the ones users created on the three PS3 games, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-13-without-warning-sony-shuts-down-online-for-older-littlebigplanet-games-to-protect-the-littlebigplanet-community"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>noted.</p><p>The unbelievably charming platformers have been a staple of PlayStation since MediaMolecule released the original <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>in 2008. It&#39;s a shame to see the community levels disappear from the Vita game and those who&#39;ve been clinging onto the PS3 versions lose access to online services. Still, it&#39;s good to see all of the community levels live on elsewhere and that they haven&#39;t just vanished forever.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest entry in the franchise, spinoff game <em>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em>, hit PS4 and PS5 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-online-multiplayer-delayed-ps5-ps4-184033689.html"><ins>last November</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-littlebigplanet-ps3-vita-servers-shut-down-163356541.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10c8cab2-46e6-44eb-acf5-411a1b142952</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:33:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631550839</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T16:34:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d7cf1e0-14af-11ec-bb4f-7cee9c1e811e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d7cf1e0-14af-11ec-bb4f-7cee9c1e811e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steve Wozniak's latest moonshot is a private space company]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steve Wozniak has started a company called Privateer Space.

He accused Amazon of strong-arming wholesalers that provide it with products into anti-competitive agreements and making them subsidize lower prices. Engadget has contacted Amazon for comment.</p><p>The AG contends that Amazon requires a guarantee from wholesalers that it will make a minimum profit when it buys and resells their products. Those deals enable Amazon to undercut competitors&#39; pricing and force wholesalers to pay the difference for lost profit margins, according to <a href="https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/a2fdda29-9dc1-46d8-8bd9-37071ac49c7c/note/0a5b3272-9ceb-4e2d-bef2-34d06480a870.#page=1">court documents</a> obtained by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/09/13/dc-attorney-general-targets-amazons-wholesale-biz-expanded-antitrust-suit/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Racine claims that Amazon&#39;s Minimum Margin Agreement (MMA) prompts wholesalers to charge more for goods elsewhere to cover those costs, making it more difficult for other e-commerce platforms to compete against Amazon&#39;s prices. The MMA leads to higher prices and less choice for consumers, according to Racine, as well as reduced levels of competition and innovation among online marketplaces.</p><p>“Amazon has continued to use its dominant position as an online marketplace to rig the system, leading to higher prices for consumers and less competition among online marketplaces,&quot; Racine told Engadget in a statement. &quot;As we further investigated Amazon’s anti-competitive practices that harm consumers and further entrench Amazon’s monopoly, we learned it was also engaging in anti-competitive agreements with first party sellers, or wholesalers – in addition to third-party sellers. I filed this antitrust lawsuit to stand up for consumers, hold Amazon accountable for its anti-competitive practices, and protect competition. We’re continuing to do just that with this amended complaint that adds more of Amazon’s misconduct.”</p><p>Others have accused Amazon of adopting such tactics. PopSockets CEO David Barnett <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/anticompetitive-complaints-against-google-apple-amazon-facebook-2020-1#amazon-hosts-counterfeits-and-bullies-its-third-party-sellers-according-to-popsockets-ceo-barnett-3">previously testified</a> that Amazon demanded payment from the company to make up for lost profits after it slashed prices.</p><p>In the initial version of his suit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-lawsui-washington-dc-attorney-general-155235736.html">which was filed in May</a>, Racine claimed Amazon blocks third-party sellers from offering their wares at lower prices on other platforms. Amazon is facing antitrust scrutiny elsewhere, including from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-five-antitrust-bills-apple-google-facebook-amazon-205114170.html">House of Representatives</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-amazon-mgm-investigation-195722033.html">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eu-amazon-antitrust-third-party-data-114513778.html">European Commission</a>.

Connecting the AirPods Pro to your iPhone for the first time is a quick and seamless process, and after that, you can go from listening to music on your Mac to taking a call on your iPhone with little hassle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AirPods Pro also have a better fitting design than standard AirPods, although that could change if Apple announces an updated model of its standard buds tomorrow. The Pros support ANC and Transparency Mode, which lets you hop in and out of conversations easily, and they support spatial audio along with Apple Music&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">Dolby Atmos format</a>. And if you want a pair of AirPods with wireless charging, the Pros are a good option because, unlike regular AirPods, their case has wireless charging support by default.</p><p>If you&#39;re more concerned about getting the latest earbuds Apple has to offer, it&#39;s worth it to wait until after tomorrow&#39;s event to see what the company has in store. However, if you&#39;re more concerned about your budget, this sale on the AirPods Pro is one of the best we&#39;ve seen in recent months.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-drop-back-down-to-180-at-amazon-141009759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44c8b8a4-7842-4d73-96ea-ca9c57547939</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 14:10:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631541927</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T14:05:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney+ 'Hawkeye' trailer shows Clint Barton's past catching up with him]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mcu">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> show will premiere on Disney+ in November and, appropriately enough, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hawkeye"><em>Hawkeye</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>has a festive setting.

That may not sound like much, considering plenty of escape rooms are cheesy monuments to corporate team-building exercises and gentrification, but I mean it as a compliment. <em>Deathloop</em> uses the fundamentals of old-school locked-room mysteries to deliver a rich and stylish universe driven by intrigue, action and strategy. The main difference between <em>Deathloop</em> and an actual escape room is, well, all the death.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a fair amount of dying in <em>Deathloop</em>. Dying is a core mechanic of the game, and it’s the first thing players actually do in the campaign, called Break the Loop. The opening scene has Colt, the main character, on his back with a murderous woman called Julianna sitting on top of him, pressing a massive blade to his chest. After some banter, she plunges the knife into Colt’s heart, and he sputters and dies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d13d10-1434-11ec-bff7-06051b7056a0" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="e0984436-4fdd-3a6d-a3a1-1e024fe47e1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>And then the game begins. Colt awakens on a cold, empty beach littered with bottles, and he makes his way to a compound built into the side of the sea wall. As he walks, glowing words appear around the environment, as if a loved one is leaving words of encouragement and warning for him. Colt is confused — he doesn’t even know his own name at this point, let alone how he got here or who’s trying to talk to him.</p><p>The identity of the message-writer is just one of a dozen or so core mysteries in <em>Deathloop</em>, and these are the driving force of the campaign. Colt’s job is to explore Blackreef, the island where he’s been trapped in an infinite respawn cycle, and learn as much about its leaders and technology as possible, in order to burn it all down. Blackreef is a retrofuturistic bubble populated by residents who split their time between partying and violently defending their consequence-free way of life, and Colt can either sneak or shoot his way through their ranks.</p><p>In action, <em>Deathloop</em> feels a lot like Dishonored<em>&nbsp;</em>(of course), with a chaser of <em>We Happy Few </em>and <em>Quadrilateral Cowboy</em>. It’s mechanically mature and narratively dense, but best of all, it doesn’t take itself too seriously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d0eef0-1434-11ec-9cd4-676d4be2cfbb" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="cf74e826-efdd-3266-9e4e-c34d5a095237"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p><em>Deathloop</em> is one of the few first-person action games that I can successfully play in stealth mode, silently taking down enemies, hacking turrets and sniping from the rooftops in order to stay alive. Usually with games like this — I’m thinking Deus Ex and Far Cry — I intend to play stealthily, but it doesn’t work out. I get too close to an enemy, or miss my headshot, or forget about that security camera, and I end up just throwing a grenade and emptying my magazine, recklessly running into danger.</p><p><em>Deathloop</em> invites the kind of stealth that I can sustain. The environments are endlessly climbable, offering plenty of vantage points for Colt to survey and mark his enemies, tracking their movements and revealing the kinds of weapons they’re carrying. If something in <em>Deathloop</em> looks scalable, it likely is, opening up the game world in all directions. Additionally, if I accidentally alert the enemies in one location, I don’t feel like I have to abandon my plans and roll in guns blazing. Generally speaking, I can find some cover, pick off the folks that follow me, and return to the rest of the mission in stealth mode. My favorite weapons in these moments are the Tribunal and the PT-6 Spiker, both of which are silent and deliver instant-kill headshots.</p><p>I’d like to blame the success of <em>Deathloop</em>’s stealth mechanics on my own skills or the masterful sense of level design coming out of Arkane Studios, but it might just be the game’s hit-or-miss AI. There are times it feels too easy to sneak up on enemies, and moments when they fail to react appropriately to Colt’s presence, standing still for seconds too long, piling up in hallways or ignoring nearby scuffles. It’s not every encounter, and there are still plenty of moments when I’m bested by the NPCs, but it’s enough that I’d classify the enemy AI in <em>Deathloop</em> as OK, rather than good.</p><section data-eng-breakout="968d877fc48b4fb1b23afcb02afe727e" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e722df80-1434-11ec-bffd-c86b67797a0b" alt="Deathloop"></section><p>Along his way, Colt picks up a variety of weapons and ultra-high-tech artifacts that grant him special abilities and perks. There are Trinkets, which are small glowing items that enhance whatever gun they’re attached to, and Slabs, which give Colt — and his enemies — superhuman powers like invisibility, telekinesis and short-distance teleportation. Once collected, the Slabs are swappable in Colt&#39;s loadout, and they tend to be tons of fun.</p><p>Blackreef is controlled by eight Visionaries of the AEON Program, one of whom is Julianna, and the only way to escape the island is for Colt to kill them all in a single day, breaking the loop. However, it’s not as simple as speedrunning through Blackreef in order to take them all out. Colt has deep ties to the AEON Program and the Visionaries all keep their own schedules, meaning a successful assassination run will require hours of information-gathering and strategizing. And, it turns out, dying.</p><p>Once he gets going, Colt is able to die twice during any playthrough with few consequences; he’s simply transported to a previous location and allowed to keep going, health restored. On the third death, however, he’s sent back to that bottle-lined beach, resources depleted.</p><p>He also loses his gear after a full day of activity, regardless of progress. <em>Deathloop</em> is divided into four times — morning, noon, afternoon and night — and after each complete sequence, Colt is beached. Certain missions can only be completed at specific times of day, so players have to plan their attacks accordingly, either shifting time forward or simply delaying until the next loop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e6d8de30-1434-11ec-b6f5-92e17974b8ad" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="ee8dff1b-e694-31a1-a31b-c4a7a4e649e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Eventually, Colt gains the ability to carry some slabs, trinkets and weapons with him between loops, though he has to infuse the items he wants to keep with a resource called Residiuum. Colt can harvest Residiuum from the shiny, glitched-out objects in Blackreef, or by killing visionaries and absorbing their energy. Residiuum can then be applied to specific items in Colt&#39;s kit, holding them for good.</p><p>With all of these trinkets, slabs, weapons, Residiuum, visionaries and loops, there’s a lot to keep tabs on in <em>Deathlooop</em>. The amount of <em>stuff </em>in the game is overwhelming at times, and it’s complicated by an intense plot filled with overlapping, time-bending mysteries. Small scraps of paper and brief audio recordings often contain crucial bits of information, rewarding players who obsessively explore every bookshelf, desk and dead-end with reams of notes and leads. The game does a good job of organizing all of these details in the resource-management screen, but overall, <em>Deathloop</em> demands full and complete attention, lest you completely lose the plot.</p><p>For those who pay attention, the story and environment of Blackreef unravels beautifully, with important secrets hidden in plain view, and new parts of the world opening and closing depending on the time of day. From this perspective, the density of things to collect, use and learn in <em>Deathloop </em>makes perfect sense. This game is built on the idea of replaying the same four maps again and again — Colt needs something new to do every time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef820610-1439-11ec-b4fb-23dd125413cc" alt="Deathloop" data-uuid="313780e8-54ee-3412-9f8e-83d8e58f8223"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bethesda</div></figure><p>Julianna is a charming constant in <em>Deathloop</em>, generally talking shit and fleshing out the background of Blackreef. She’s also the star of the game’s second mode, Protect the Loop. Here, players are able to invade the games of friends or strangers, playing as Julianna and hunting down Colt as he tries to complete a mission. She has her own loadout, trinkets and slabs, including a masquerade ability that lets her trade appearances with allied NPCs — meaning, everyone except Colt.</p><p>Protect the Loop is marked by long periods of silence and inactivity, followed by furious gunfire and death. Colt can take any route he wants through the various maps, and Julianna has to actively hunt him down or wait for him to appear near the objective. She may be able to disguise herself, but she only has one life, while Colt has to die three times to make it final. This results in a delicious cat-and-mouse game that’s different with each new player.</p><p>That said, Protect the Loop is also where I’ve encountered the most technical issues. I played on PS5, and one round crashed fully right after launching, while two more were completely unplayable from my end, repeatedly setting my Julianna back a few frames until Colt finally showed up and shot her. That’s in comparison with four glitch-free rounds. My recommendation here is to use an ethernet cable, rather than Wi-Fi, and make sure your friends do, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cb4015996930402d9c4ab7abb95233e6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ef8d29a0-1439-11ec-8af7-a33e54a825d6" alt="Deathloop"></section><p><em>Deathloop</em> is incredibly dense, but it’s also inherently forgiving. Relying on death as a mechanic in Break the Loop takes the sting out of failing a cycle or two, since retrying is built into the narrative. Colt uncovers helpful information in most of his runs, even when he ends up dead — like, <em>dead</em> dead — and it feels like there’s always something new to uncover in Blackreef, no matter how many times he returns to the same location. If it does ever get old, there’s always the option to Protect the Loop.</p><p>And then Break the Loop. And then Protect the Loop. And then Break the Loop.</p><p>You get the idea.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7b92d17-9157-482a-950e-51626057c3ea</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 12:01:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631526903</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T09:55:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e7003c50-1434-11ec-b9fe-63c750ef7954" width="2950" height="1659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bethesda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Deathloop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo significantly cuts Switch price in Europe]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has officially lowered the suggested retail price of the base Switch model in Europe, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/nintendo_switch_base_model_price_officially_reduced_to_p259e269_across_europe"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a> has reported, hopefully telegraphing a similar drop in the US.

The new model has a larger 7-inch, 720p OLED display with smaller bezels, a new kickstand, an ethernet port and speaker improvements, though no other upgraded parts. With everything else unchanged, the lower pricing makes the base model a relatively good deal.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We made the price change before the launch of Nintendo Switch - OLED Model so that the price differences between each model in Nintendo&#39;s own retail channel, My Nintendo Store, would be what Nintendo judges to be appropriate for its own store,&quot; Nintendo said.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch base model is still showing at $300 in the US at Amazon and Nintendo&#39;s official store, so hopefully that will change in the near future.

Well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max will have up to 1TB of storage alongside 128GB, 256GB and 512GB options carried over from the iPhone 12 Pro family.

The DoD wants to launch missions venturing beyond Earth orbit, and existing electric and solar spacecraft are neither suitable for that job nor suitable to smaller vehicles, the department&#39;s Defense Innovation Unit said.</p><p>The nuclear propulsion system will ideally offer &quot;high delta-V&quot; (above 33ft/s) while scaling down to less than 2,000kg in dry mass (4,409lbs on Earth). On top of providing electricity for the payload, the technology will hopefully keep the spacecraft warm when in shadow and minimize radiation both on the ground and to other components. Responses are expected by September 23rd, with contracts handed out as quickly as 60 to 90 days afterward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials acknowledged they were making the request as a matter of expediency. NASA and other agencies are already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/darpa-lockheed-martin-blue-origin-nuclear-spacecraft-100547792.html">developing or backing nuclear spacecraft</a>, but those won&#39;t be ready for a long while. The DoD is hoping for a prototype within three to five years — this technology would serve as a stopgap that puts nuclear propulsion into service relatively quickly for near-term projects.</p><p>While the request didn&#39;t provide clues as to what spacecraft were in the works, the focus on smaller spacecraft suggests it could involve probes, satellites or other vehicles with modest goals. You won&#39;t see this power human trips to Mars. All the same, it&#39;s clear the DoD is frustrated by the limitations of existing spacecraft engines and wants a fast track to more powerful designs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/defense-department-nuclear-spacecraft-propulsion-211213947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20e61779-f603-4b41-8a82-24af2a98d4a2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 12 Sep 2021 21:12:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631535881</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T12:24:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2dde4230-1407-11ec-9014-3044c194d6c2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA nuclear thermal propulsion spacecraft concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic appeals ruling in lawsuit against Apple over App Store rules]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic may have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">scored a notable victory</a> in its lawsuit against Apple, but it&#39;s dissatisfied enough to keep the legal battle going. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle">reports</a> Epic has <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21061142-epic-games-appeal">filed an appeal</a> against the ruling.

While COVID-19 still hurt box office numbers (<em>Shang-Chi</em>&#39;s $75.5 million US opening paled in comparison to multiple Disney 2019 releases), the revenue may have been enough to justify returning to pre-pandemic distribution.</p><p>There&#39;s also the matter of placating key factions. Disney said it has a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html">pay talent fairly</a> for hybrid theater-and-digital relases, but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Scarlett Johansson&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html"><em>Black Widow</em> lawsuit</a> plays a role in considering Disney+ launches. The company might not want to risk further trouble with actors and others whose income depends on theatrical performance. And then there&#39;s the theaters themselves. When chains like AMC vowed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trolls-word-tour-pvod-amc-062745004.html">pull Universal movies</a> even when many locations were closed, Disney might not be willing to provoke a similar confrontation as theaters resume business.</p><p>This and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">Warner Bros.&#39; 2022 return to theaters</a> supports the expectations of many cynics — that studios only saw day-one streaming access as a temporary necessity that would disappear the moment it was reasonably safe to watch on big screens. That&#39;s not completely shocking when the movie industry&#39;s business model still revolves around theaters, but any fundamental shifts in strategy might not happen for a long, long time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8719f9c-54f8-4def-8683-dd5f65889f40</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 16:13:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631376790</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T16:13:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and 'rose charts']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Crimean War, hospitals of the day weren&#39;t so much centers of healing or recovery as they were the places where injured combatants went to die slightly more slowly. Turkey&#39;s Scutari hospital was one such notorious example. Converted by the British Empire from army barracks, Scutari lacked every imaginable amenity, from basic sanitation to sufficient ventilation, this &quot;hospital&quot; served as a potent incubator for myriad infectious diseases — that is until Florence Nightingale and her team of volunteer nurses arrived in 1854.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>Maladies of Empire</em></a> by Jim Downs explores how many aspects of modern medicine are borne on the backs of humanity&#39;s most abhorrent impulses, though in the excerpt below, Downs illustrates how one woman&#39;s unyielding tenacity and fastidious record keeping helped launch the field of preventative medicine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3ea0be0-0fff-11ec-b5cb-197e93c2d343" alt="Maladies of Empire" data-uuid="3cd128b6-22ae-3b1b-aba7-030287f4a386"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Belknap Press</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from </em><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>MALADIES OF EMPIRE: HOW COLONIALISM, SLAVERY, AND WAR TRANSFORMED MEDICINE </em></a><em>by JIM DOWNS, published by The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

She took notes on everything from cleanliness to the quantity of supplies to diet to the placement of latrines and graveyards.</p><p>She also carefully examined the physical space. She took careful note of the size of the wards, the condition of the roof, and the quality, size, and placement of the windows. In her book on the health of the British army, like Thomas Trotter and others who wrote about the importance of fresh air, she pointed to the problem of improper ventilation, and she devoted an entire section to “bad ventilation.” She quoted the report of the sanitary commission, which remarked on the “defective state of the ventilation” in the Barrack Hospital. There were only “a few small openings here and there,” so that there was no way for the “hot and foul” air to escape. As an adherent of the miasma theory, she believed that diseases were spread through the air and advocated for ventilation to release the “foul air” from hospitals.</p><p>In addition to inadequate ventilation, Nightingale pointed to poor drainage and badly designed sewers and plumbing. In her testimony to the royal commission, Nightingale reported on the filthy conditions she found in the Barrack Hospital when she arrived. “The state of the privies... for several months, more than an inch deep in filth, is too horrible to describe.” She observed six dead dogs under one of the windows, and a dead horse lay in the aqueduct for weeks. The drinking water was dirty; once she saw used hospital uniforms in the water tank. Rats and insects abounded, and “the walls and ceilings were saturated with organic matter.”</p><p>In the conclusion to her report on the health of the British Army, she explained, “We have much more information on the sanitary history of the Crimean campaign than we have upon any other, but because it is a complete exam (history does not afford its equal) of an army, after failing to the lowest ebb of disease and disaster from neglects committed, rising again to the highest state of health and efficiency from remedies applied.</p><p>&quot;It is the whole experiment on a colossal scale.” She pointed out that during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign, mortality exceeded that of the plague of 1665 as well as that of recent cholera epidemics. But during the last six months of the war, after sanitary reforms had been made, “we had... a mortality among our sick little more than that among our healthy Guards at home.”</p><p>Using mortality data that she had collected during the war, along with domestic mortality statistics, Nightingale showed that between 1839 and 1853, mortality among soldiers was much higher than among civilian men: “of 10,000 soldiers [at the age of 20], 7,077 live to the age of 39, out of whom 135 die in the next year of age; whereas out of 10,000 civilians at the age of 20, 8,253 attain the age of 39, and of those 106 die in the year of age following.” Nearly all mortality among soldiers was the result of disease; “actual losses in battle form a very small part of the calamities of a long war.” Nightingale classified the causes of death as “zymotic diseases” (which in the nineteenth century referred to infectious diseases such as fevers, measles, and cholera), “chest and tubercular diseases,” and “all other diseases (including violent deaths).” Nightingale was critical of the army’s classification system for diseases. At the bottom of a chart, she notes, “Bronchitis and influenza have no place in the Army nomenclature. The chronic catarrh of the Army Returns is believed to be really phthisis, in the great majority of cases; acute catarrh comprehends both epidemic catarrh, or influenza and bronchitis.”</p><p>Nightingale presented statistics using charts, tables, and diagrams, which were just beginning to appear in research reports, to make it easier for readers to visualize the comparison she was making. She developed a new kind of graphic, called a “rose chart,” also known as a coxcomb chart or polar area diagram, to present mortality data from the Crimean War. Each chart, which is laid out like a pie, shows data from one year, with the slices representing months. Each slice is divided into colored segments whose area is proportional to the number of deaths.</p><p>One segment is for deaths from wounds, a second for “preventable or mitigable zymotic diseases,” and a third for all other causes. A quick glance at the charts of deaths from April 1854 to March 1855 and April 1855 to March 1856 is enough to show that many more deaths were caused by disease than by combat, and that overall mortality decreased in the second year.</p><p>To further make visible the dangers of unsanitary hospitals, Nightingale gathered mortality data for matrons, nuns, and nurses working in fifteen London hospitals who died of the “zymotic diseases” of fever and cholera. She presented tables, which she notes William Farr compiled for her, showing that the mortality rate of the nursing staff was much higher than that of the female population in London; in addition, women working in hospitals were more likely to die of zymotic diseases than were other women. She used these figures to argue for the “very great importance” of hygiene in hospitals. “The loss of a well-trained nurse by preventible [sic] disease,” she wrote, “is a greater loss than is that of a good soldier from the same cause. Money cannot replace either, but a good nurse is more difficult to find than a good soldier.”</p><p>In her book Notes on Hospitals, she retold the story of the British prisoners of war who died in a crowded jail cell in India in 1756: “Shut up 150 people in a Black hole of Calcutta, and in twenty-four hours an infection is produced so intense that it will, in that time, have destroyed nearly the whole of the inmates.” Nightingale’s reference to the case is evidence for its status as the prototypical illustration of the need for ventilation. And the fact that it took place in India shows how British medical authorities used information from around the empire.</p><p>As a result of her work with large numbers of patients in the Crimean War, Nightingale framed her analysis like an epidemiologist, in terms of populations. She focused on how disease spread within a group. She devoted her energies not to changing bedpans or dressing wounds but to studying the structure of hospitals, analyzing statistics, and figuring out how to increase ventilation.</p><p>The war provided her the opportunity to compare mortality rates in varied settings: crowded hospitals, shabby tents, and wooden huts. It also underscored to her the importance of preventive measures, which constitutes one of the major tenets of modern epidemiology. By publishing her observations, her insights, and guidelines for hospitals to follow, she hoped to provide a set of rules and guidelines for physicians to follow to prevent the spread of disease. While efforts to ensure proper hygiene as a way to guard against illness can be traced to Mesopotamian civilization and Sanskrit writings from 2000 BCE, Nightingale’s warnings, in particular, and sanitary reform, more generally, sparked a critical turning point in the middle of the nineteenth century that gave rise to preventive medicine. This transformed military medicine from an enterprise that largely focused on treatment and surgery to one that began to engage epidemiological questions and issues.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-maladies-of-empire-jim-downs-belknap-press-153044507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f1d7fff-3b7f-4dcc-9236-865cca0a76b7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 15:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631045430</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T20:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and &#39;rose charts&#39;]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla rolls out Full Self Driving 10 beta with more confident decision making]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html">last big Full Self Driving beta</a> was about enabling more semi-autonomous features off the highway, its newest release is focused more on helping you trust those features. <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/11/tesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet/">notes</a> Tesla has started rolling out a Full Self Driving 10 beta that, from early <a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1436624804107354117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436624804107354117%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2021%2F09%2F11%2Ftesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet%2F">reports</a>, appears to make smarter and more confident decisions off the highway.

The improvements won&#39;t necessarily justify the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">steep prices</a> for the FSD package, but you may well be happier with the purchase — if just because you can rely on not-quite-driverless features more often.</p><div id="e57707210d0746828e50b053883dda66"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roundabout also very smooth on new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FSDBeta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FSDBeta</a><a href="https://t.co/bHctiBcG0F">pic.twitter.com/bHctiBcG0F</a></p>— Tesla Raj (@tesla_raj) <a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1436624804107354117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8567fad8-e529-4af6-9e6c-3959ec4772b5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 14:50:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631371837</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T14:50:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b83e0b30-1309-11ec-876f-feaa47043738" width="3571" height="2381" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b83e0b30-1309-11ec-876f-feaa47043738" width="3571" height="2381" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[June 10, 2018 Los Angeles / CA / USA - The new Model 3 Tesla driving on the freeway, Los Angeles county]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The new Model 3 Tesla driving on the freeway]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says motorcycle vibrations can damage iPhone cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hold off on purchasing that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/i-loved-the-iphone-12-mini-173037929.html">iPhone</a> mount for your motorbike. In a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803">Apple Support post</a> first seen by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the tech giant has warned that high amplitude vibrations, &quot;specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines&quot; transmitted through handlebars, can damage its phones&#39; cameras. As the publication notes, that damage can be permanent. A simple Google search will surface <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/594197/Will+shaking+damage+the+image+stabilization">posts</a> over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/76ezfz/psa_motorcycle_vibration_can_damage_cell_phone/">past</a> few years by users whose cameras were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/ht0sv3/psa_iphone_11_camera_destroyed_via_motorcycle/">ruined</a> after they mounted their iPhone on their bike, mostly so they can use it for navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple didn&#39;t say why it&#39;s issuing a warning now, it did explain the reason why attaching the iPhone to a motorcycle can destroy its camera. The company said that the camera&#39;s optical image stabilization (OIS) and closed-loop autofocus (AF) features can be damaged by long-term exposure to high-amplitude vibrations. A camera&#39;s OIS makes it possible for a device&#39;s gyroscope to sense movement. In turn, the gyroscope changes its angle and the lens moves accordingly to prevent blur when you accidentally move while taking a photo.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile with closed-loop AF, a phone&#39;s onboard magnetic sensors measure vibrations to compensate for the movement, so the lens can be positioned accurately. As <em>MacRumor</em> notes, all models since the iPhone 7 come with both features.</p><p>Thus, Apple says it&#39;s not recommended to attach iPhones to motorcycles with high-power or high-volume engines. For mopeds and scooters, you may want to buy a vibration-dampening mount to lessen the risk of damage — or simply just use another GPS device to make sure you don&#39;t ruin a device that costs hundreds to over a thousand dollars.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-motorcycle-vibrations-iphone-camera-warning-083801715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b467970a-d6a6-48a1-848b-1d6eadbb4c0d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 08:38:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631541612</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T14:00:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27e7c470-12d4-11ec-9b1f-ef481070a5ea" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27e7c470-12d4-11ec-9b1f-ef481070a5ea" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[humanmade via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Caucasian male biker sitting on his motorbike and using his smart phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Handsome Caucasian male biker mounting his motorbike]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
