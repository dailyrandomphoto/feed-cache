According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-mcflurry-machine-is-broken-again-now-the-ftc-is-on-it-11630522266"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the agency recently reached out to McDonald’s restaurant owners to collect more information on their experiences with the machines.</p><p>Why is the FTC looking into McFlurry machines, you ask? The answer may have something to do with the right to repair movement. At the start of July, President Biden ordered the agency to draft new rules to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html"><ins>empower consumers and businesses</ins></a> to repair their devices on their own. Later that same month, the FTC made good on that order, voting unanimously to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html"><ins>tackle unlawful repair restrictions</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By all accounts, McFlurry machines are a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqbm5/mcdonalds-franchises-hack-mcflurry-machines-to-bypass-sanitization-process"><ins>nightmare to repair</ins></a>. Moreover, Taylor, the firm that makes them, is at the center of a legal battle over measures it uses to prevent restaurants from repairing the machines on their own. When a McFlurry machine breaks down, only a certified technician from Taylor is allowed to fix it, leading to long wait times. Those wait times have increased during the pandemic. A federal judge <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymbp/why-the-mcflurry-machine-company-just-got-hit-with-a-restraining-order"><ins>recently sided with a company</ins></a> that produces a diagnostic tool that threatens Taylor’s monopoly on repairs.</p><p>The FTC hasn’t opened a formal probe yet. “The existence of a preliminary investigation does not indicate the FTC or its staff have found any wrongdoing,” the agency said in the letter it sent out this summer, according to <em>The Journal</em>. However, it reportedly wants to know how often restaurant owners are allowed to work on the McFlurry machines on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-mcflurry-letter-221312872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad6d1aba-c789-4fd0-9cdf-edbfd54bc576</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 22:13:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630534396</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T22:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mikhail Tereshchenko via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - AUGUST 3, 2020: A woman eats an ice cream in a street.

The social site has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/">banned</a> r/NoNewNormal and quarantined 54 other COVID-19 denial subreddits, but not over the false claims themselves. Instead, it&#39;s for abuse — NoNewNormal was caught brigading en masse (that is, flooding other subreddits) despite warnings, while the other communities violated a rule forbidding harassment and bullying.</p><p>The company didn&#39;t, however, relent on its approach to tackling the misinformation itself. Reddit said it clamps down on posts that encourage a &quot;significant risk of physical harm&quot; or are manipulations intended to mislead others, but made no mention of purging posts or subreddits merely for making demonstrably false claims about COVID-19 or vaccines.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit previously defended its position by arguing its platform was meant to foster &quot;open and authentic&quot; conversations, even if they disagree with a widely established consensus. However, that stance hasn&#39;t satisfied many of Reddit&#39;s users. <em>Business Insider</em><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/135-subreddits-are-going-dark-to-protest-reddits-refusal-to-ban-covid-disinformation/ar-AANYZHy">noted</a> 135 subreddits went &quot;dark&quot; (that is, went private) in protest over Reddit&#39;s seeming tolerance of COVID-19 misinformation, including major communities like r/TIFU.</p><p>Critics among those groups contended that Reddit let these groups blossom through &quot;inaction and malice,&quot; and that Reddit wasn&#39;t consistent in enforcing its own policies on misinformation and abuse. As one redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/hb7ovdd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">pointed out</a>, Reddit&#39;s claims about allowing dissenting ideas don&#39;t carry much weight — the COVID-19 denial groups are presenting false statements, not just contrary opinions.</p><p>The situation is a familiar one. Reddit was accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-opportunity-policy-change-002246893.html">dragging its heels on hate speech</a>, responding only when the outcry became too loud to ignore. The misinformation response suggests Reddit is repeating that behavior. Not that this would be shocking. The site often finds itself trying to balance its need to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-poltical-ads-new-policy-093954730.html">please advertisers</a> with a desire to foster free expression, and this is just the latest instance of that balancing act creating an uproar.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bans-covid-19-misinformation-communities-211159271.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dddf5a7e-9431-4adf-9e29-facd1fa12f8b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 21:11:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630530722</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T21:12:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e79752b0-0b61-11ec-bffd-e953d056bc92" width="4500" height="3004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e79752b0-0b61-11ec-bffd-e953d056bc92" width="4500" height="3004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2020/04/10: In this photo illustration a Reddit logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with a  COVID 19 sample on the background.

The body is only slightly bigger than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/red-6k-komodo-camera-available-083533822.html">Komodo</a>, but it touts a brand new, 35.4-megapixel VV full-frame sensor that offers a large 17 stops of dynamic range and &quot;cinema-quality&quot; scan times twice as fast as any other RED camera.</p><p>You might not have to sacrifice quality for speed, either. The V-Raptor ST can shoot 16-bit REDCODE RAW video at 8K and 120 frames per second, and you can ramp it up to 600 frames per second at 2K if you&#39;re capturing slow-motion shots. While RED may be stretching things by claiming you can &quot;always deliver&quot; at greater than 4K (you clearly need to step down in some situations), you might feel a twinge of regret if your production team spent close to $60,000 on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-the-cameras-youtubers-love.html">Monstro 8K</a> that &#39;only&#39; manages 60FPS at full resolution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new camera includes other creature comforts. A dedicated user display on the side helps assistants tweak settings and save presets, and improved cooling (including a quiet 60mm fan) helps you work in tougher conditions.</p><p>You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of ports, including two 12G-SDI outputs, nine-pin EXT (for breakout boxes), USB-C and the obligatory pogo pin connector for a monitor. ODU output on the side can break out to XLR or 3.5mm audio. Not surprisingly, you&#39;ll want fast storage — RED supports compatible CFexpress 2.0 Type B cards that can record R3D and ProRes at up to 800MB/s.</p><p>The price is squarely in pro filmmaker territory. The body alone sells for $24,500, and you&#39;ll likely want to spend $29,580 on a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; with useful add-ons like a 7-inch touchscreen, a RED 660GB CFexpress card (plus the matching card reader) and a pair of batteries. That&#39;s not including the RF-mount lenses and adapters you might need if you&#39;re new to the RED ecosystem. If you&#39;re the sort who regularly shoots 8K video for a living, though, this might represent a bargain if you&#39;re looking for high-end video equipment.</p><div id="58b10bdde9b24a158f89b41d87072b6f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmQ8huunigk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/red-v-raptor-st-8k-camera-200544378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32dca5ad-5e65-4fc5-9a01-de20b778ce4c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:05:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630526217</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T19:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Red]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX says Amazon is trying to delay Starlink because it can't compete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX isn&#39;t pulling any punches in its response to Amazon&#39;s latest stalling tactics.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/apple-asks-all-u-s-employees-to-report-vaccination-status?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company recently sent out a memo requesting workers, whether they currently work out of an office or not, to share that information by September 17th. Apple reportedly plans to use the data it collects to inform its ongoing COVID-19 response.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports the company told employees it would keep their vaccine status “confidential and secure” by aggregating the information but said that could change in the future. “It is possible your vaccination status may be used in an identifiable manner, along with other information about your general work environment such as your building location, if we determine or, if it is required that, this information is necessary in order to ensure a healthy and safe work environment,” Apple said in the memo, according to the outlet. It&#39;s not clear what repercussions if any an employee will face if they do not provide their vaccination status by the deadline.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to the company for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">Unlike Google</a>, Apple currently does not require employees to be vaccinated before they can come to the office. Still, the company has started to nudge its workers in that direction more forcefully. For example, it recently began a campaign encouraging workers to get their shot.</p><p>The company’s request, and the admission that the information employees share with it may be used in an identifiable manner, come as Apple faces increasing scrutiny over how it handles the privacy of its workers. A recent report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"><em>The Verge</em></a> detailed some of the company’s policies on that front. For instance, one such rule prohibits employees from wiping their work devices before returning them to the company. This latest policy may further fuel those concerns.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">618670f0-a7ad-4b66-a760-06975c640828</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 18:54:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630522562</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T18:56:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c6481c0-0b53-11ec-bff7-4a108c4a0897" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c6481c0-0b53-11ec-bff7-4a108c4a0897" width="5000" height="3335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CUPERTINO, UNITED STATES - 2020/02/23: Customers at the Apple Park Visitor Center in Cupertino.

New to this model is a telescoping mechanism that will allow you to extend the gimbal. That’s something that should give those who buy the OM 5 more ways to compose their photos and videos. According to the outlet, the device will cost €159 (about $188) and stand approximately 6.7 inches tall when you collapse down the telescoping mechanism.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ac0c130-0b4a-11ec-b9ff-a71c683ba34b" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="DJI Osmo Mobile 5" data-uuid="bdc61ea8-69ca-3481-9626-eb415538f3ce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">WinFuture</div></figure><p>Judging by the images <em>WinFuture</em> shared, it doesn’t look like the Osmo Mobile 5 extends quite as long as a more affordable selfie stick, but that’s probably for the best since the weight of your smartphone and the included magnetic mounting system would make the gimbal unwieldy at best and prone to breaking at worst. Unfortunately, it appears that added flexibility will come at the cost of battery life. The new model can reportedly go six hours and 20 minutes on a single charge. By contrast, you can get up to 15 hours of use from the Osmo Mobile 4’s 2,450mAh battery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f827117cbc51435f8cd0eef5143fa74b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">btw...

Last week’s hinged on a minor change — Hope Pym joining SHIELD — that spiraled out with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-three-avengers-disney-plus-175935938.html">huge consequences</a>. This week shows us a simple substitution again, putting Dr. Christine Palmer in the car with Stephen Strange and killing her off in the accident that in another timeline, destroyed the gifted surgeon’s hands instead.</p><p>Her death ends up being the catalyst for Strange studying the mystic arts, and the events shown here pretty much follow the same lines as they did in the film. It’s kind of unlikely, given that a motive to fix one’s injured hands is small peanuts compared to an attempt to undo death. But we still see Stephen training in Kamar-Taj, learning about the Eye of Agamotto and eventually fighting Dormammu. As far as the timeline is concerned, everything is pretty much the same.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f012e870-0b46-11ec-b6ea-f85e7a80cb19" alt="Dr. Strange studying the mystic arts" data-uuid="46619465-4c19-3038-a45f-bb9143ed7ead"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Except Stephen, who can’t get Christine’s death out of his head. He ends up going back to the moment of the crash and trying to save his girlfriend’s life, only to fail again and again. Since her death was the catalyst for him to learn magic, he can’t use his powers to save her. She is a fixed point, an unchangeable event (something <em>Doctor Who</em> fans will be well acquainted with).</p><p>For the viewer, this raises a big question: If Christine’s death is really such a concrete event in the time stream, how did we end up with “our” Stephen Strange back over in the regular MCU timeline? Here, the episode inspired an intriguing possibility: that perhaps this Doctor Strange will succeed in changing the timeline so that Christine isn’t in the car and he destroys his hands, in fact making this episode a prequel to the 2016 film. That would have been a rather mind bending twist that certainly would have made this series more important, though still not essential, to the MCU.</p><div id="8ae46fcf910a43febab71100ce250d09"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsQjh63n-jI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Alas, it was not to be, with Strange descending further and further into his obsession to the point where even our narrator is concerned. And for the first time, a character becomes aware that they are being observed and actually calls the Watcher out. Like in the <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode, the sequence is intended as a demonstration of power, showing that Strange has reached the level of awareness to notice the fourth wall. But still his powers are limited; he’s not cognizant of the audience (though Uatu the Watcher is, having addressed us directly earlier in the episode) and his pleas for assistance ultimately go unheeded.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94ac7870-0b46-11ec-8bff-cec1e1642c7e" alt="Uatu the Watcher, being creepy" data-uuid="93d7c2d8-4bc4-3119-8431-69682125c1e3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Compared with the first three episodes, this one ends on a dark note. That’s actually truer to the original comic series the show is based on where, freed from the constraints of long-term continuity, the writers could take the story in whatever direction they wanted. If they wanted to kill everyone they could and would, since the main timeline was to go unaffected and future issues of <em>What If…?</em> would just hit the reset button.</p><p>Whether the animated version will go the same way remains to be seen, but with the fourth episode an underlying sense of continuity has started to develop: The tentacled creature from &quot;What If... Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?&quot; makes a reappearance, and Uatu acknowledges to the audience the stories he’s already told, which at the bare minimum hints that these episodes are meant to be viewed in a specific order. <em>What If…?</em> may be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html">a diversion</a>, but there seems to be a destination on the horizon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-doctor-strange-episode-four-173005535.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0715d6b4-e383-414e-987e-def953f8bf66</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:30:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630525251</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T19:40:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ae6c750-0b45-11ec-af3f-f69a92de6665" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ae6c750-0b45-11ec-af3f-f69a92de6665" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Benedict Cumberbatch voices Stephen Strange]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Doctor Strange in Marvel Studios' 'What If...?']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[CDPR still plans to release 'Cyberpunk 2077' and 'The Witcher 3' console upgrades in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>CD Projekt Red hasn&#39;t revealed exactly when it will roll out the long-promised PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrades for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Cyberpunk%202077"><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/The%20Witcher%203%3A%20Wild%20Hunt"><em><ins>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</ins></em></a>. However, it says it&#39;s still on track to release them by the end of the year. The studio listed &quot;late 2021&quot; as the timeframe for those upgrades in its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2021/09/h1-2021-results-presentation.pdf"><ins>financial report</ins></a> for the first half of the year.</p><p>The timeline still fits with the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> roadmap that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-212705795.html"><ins>CDPR published in January</ins></a>. At the time, it said the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrades would arrive in the second half of the year.

The game was in such a bad state at the outset that Sony swiftly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-pulled-sony-012418332.html"><ins>yoinked </ins><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em><ins> from the PlayStation Store</ins></a>, and didn&#39;t allow the game back until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-124829914.html"><ins>six months later</ins></a> (albeit with a warning about performance on the base PS4).</p><p>The most recent <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>patch included the first batch of promised free downloadable content. However, this only amounted to cosmetic items and a new look for Johnny Silverhand, Keanu Reeves&#39; character. There are still expansions to the game on the way, though.</p><p>Still, given the widespread spate of game delays we&#39;ve seen over the last year or so, including a couple of delays to Cyberpunk 2077 itself, its encouraging that CDPR is still confident about releasing the current-gen upgrades for both games in the next few months.</p><p>Between around a third and 40 percent of CDPR&#39;s developers are currently working on <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>support and the current-gen upgrade, according to a chart in the financial report. It&#39;s hard to tell, since the chart doesn&#39;t include actual percentages. In any case, that&#39;s down from over half of the team as of the end of 2020 as the studio gradually shifts employees to other projects. One of those is the first expansion for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which doesn&#39;t currently have a release window.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7ce73960-0b45-11ec-9caa-bc498b9e1b48" style="height:760;width:1392;" alt="CDPR development staff breakdown" data-uuid="90a71f17-5d08-3a69-a2fc-b1f739c7a874"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CD Projekt Red</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-witcher-3-upgrades-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-cd-projekt-red-172038747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23227fc3-2160-4a40-b458-693dcf6406e7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:20:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630516128</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T17:08:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b815190-ca9d-11eb-aeef-dc94854bd490" width="1918" height="1078" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b815190-ca9d-11eb-aeef-dc94854bd490" width="1918" height="1078" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TimTheTatman is the latest major Twitch streamer to defect to YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">DrLupo</a> isn&#39;t the only big-name Twitch streamer leaving for YouTube.

Microsoft spurred the first round, paying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-ninja-twitch-mixer-fortnite.html">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-shroud-twitch-mixer-ninja.html">Shroud</a> and other top streamers to jump ship for Mixer. We wouldn&#39;t expect a similar outcome, though. Mixer struggled to compete against its livestreaming rivals, leading Microsoft to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mixer-ninja-shroud-streamers-twitch-youtube-facebook-163007393.html">shut the service down</a>. Creators had to quickly find alternatives, and some of them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ninja-twitch-mixer-streaming-170015433.html">returned to Twitch</a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shroud-twitch-return-first-stream-time-193742742.html">exclusivity deals</a>.

While many larger creators have an established YouTube presence for their on-demand videos, that doesn&#39;t guarantee they&#39;ll watch live shows on Google&#39;s service. Even so, this could be a coup for YouTube — and a blow to Twitch if it can&#39;t hold on to its best-known stars.</p><div id="1f3cf3f968f1434b9c846dceb34fa821"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the future<a href="https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA">https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA</a><a href="https://t.co/ekGwDreHOL">pic.twitter.com/ekGwDreHOL</a></p>— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) <a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9f6438a-dca3-47a1-9ea7-99938549598d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:07:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630515244</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:54:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TimTheTatman/Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests new harassment prevention feature with ‘Safety Mode’]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is experimenting with its most aggressive anti-harassment features to date.

It’s just two minutes long and filled with overlapping shots of drums, mics, guitars and snakelike cables packed into a lonely desert hideaway, all while an unsettling, ambient score gathers layers of sound. Over time, the scenes are flooded with red and the film is overcome by a horrendous groaning scream. Thin white text flashes across the screen, telling a disjointed story about burying bones and walking with the bloom of a burgeoning universe.</p><p>Among this vibrating chaos, there are hints about the kind of studio Eyes Out will be and even what the team’s first game might look like. Or, more aptly, what it might sound like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="80075cd5f57b4007b643c0b11713e1a0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Doja9yZOBuU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Eyes Out is the new video game studio founded by Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck and veteran AAA director Cory Davis, and the team is already hard at work on its first title, a mysterious horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio.</p><p>“We want to create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality,” Davis said. “That&#39;s what we&#39;re really excited about. We’re all fans of horror, but specifically this kind of — it&#39;s a new and emerging space that doesn&#39;t just sit within the extremely violent and dark and terrifying, but also reaches into the vibrant and even surprises you with moments of bliss or self-reflection. Horror really has a lot of room to grow.”</p><p>Finck added on to that thought, saying, “We&#39;re playing in this field that provides an emotional and psychological response, which really, I feel, is heightened as a singular experience. And we&#39;re really fortunate to be attracting developers who are so genuinely passionate about these types of conversations.”</p><p>Davis has built a successful career as a video game designer, directing and crafting high-profile titles including <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> and <em>Here They Lie</em>, but he’s also a composer. In fact, the first word of his <a href="https://twitter.com/Snak3Fist">Twitter bio</a> reads, “musician.” Meanwhile, Finck’s <a href="https://twitter.com/robinfinck?lang=en">Twitter bio</a> has just two tags, both of which speak for themselves: @eyesoutofficial and @nineinchnails.</p><p>Note which one comes first.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d85e60-0a95-11ec-bae8-c275210803da" alt="Eyes Out" data-uuid="3922fa90-6df7-3b58-a539-91f9d4c33048"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Eyes Out</div></figure><p>Finck got involved in the video game industry about six years ago, after striking up a friendship with Devolver Digital co-founder Mike Wilson at Burning Man. Finck ended up handling the soundtrack for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-01-nine-inch-nails-guitarist-robin-finck-soundtrack-noct.html"><em>Noct</em></a>, a top-down horror game published by Devolver in 2015, and his interest in development was piqued. He dove further into the video game industry, attending conventions and connecting with creators.</p><p>“I was just really inspired by people and their enthusiasm, the forward tech of it all, and the collision of art and music, design, agency, narrative, and also the experience of really becoming immersed in all of this,” Finck said. “It really feels like the most focused and the most highly attuned experience to imbibe this sort of storytelling. And that continues to turn me on. And this led me, fortunately enough for me, to meet Cory as he and his team were completing <em>Here They Lie</em>.”</p><p>Eventually, Finck found himself at Sony Santa Monica, playing an early version of Davis’ VR horror title, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05018_00-DANA000PS4000123/"><em>Here They Lie</em></a>. He was floored by it. Finck and Davis got to talking, and they haven’t stopped since.</p><p>“We immediately were talking about sound and music and the weight of that and the experience,” Finck said. “And we kept on in the coming days and weeks and months. And then eventually were working together on music for projects that Cory was heralding. We have a <em>simpatico</em> workflow and creatively sync in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Davis remembered feeling a spark at that first meeting, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aaf39f9096f749c3a479ead7ffe2d9f8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d2b910-0a95-11ec-bbb7-1a3ebe2790f0" alt="Eyes Out"></section><p>“We started to go down the rabbit hole of distortion pedals and different synthesizers and stuff like that,” he said. “But that led us to this other type of discussion where I really felt this connection in terms of an understanding of the power of games as a medium and the impact and the possibility of what the medium holds for the future.”</p><p>Davis and Finck were both interested in building a single-player experience around music and tone, rather than starting with a narrative or visual style and applying sound later on in the process.</p><p>“From the first conversation with Robin, I could feel that he&#39;s this other type of creator that wants to be driven by his passion and his soul, rather than maybe what&#39;s trendy or what&#39;s even necessarily gratifying,” Davis said. “I just felt this kind of depth of possibility of what we could do together. I had other prototypes going on at the time at my old studio, but every time I got back together with Robin, our conversations would go deeper. And they&#39;d go beyond the music and they&#39;d go to places where I&#39;d been hoping to go my whole journey as a game developer.”</p><p>Eyes Out is the result of this creative magnetism between Davis and Finck. They’ve attracted other developers, too, and have hired <a href="https://www.eyes-out.com/team">15 collaborators</a> from the industries of visual art, film and games to work on their first project.</p><p>“That&#39;s really what I&#39;ve been looking for since way back in the <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> days, was to build a team that has a diverse enough approach to both things like the difficulties in game development, as well as their acceptance and embrace of people that are from different parts of the world, from different backgrounds, that are of any kind of personality, and especially people that have been downtrodden and haven&#39;t had opportunities in the past,” Davis said. “We see those opportunities allowing us to have so much more depth in the types of stories that we&#39;re able to tell.”</p><div id="5a27248a9d864e09bd8b483f60ba04b3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaAmzYSBCeI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There’s no name or release window for the studio’s first game, but Davis and Finck are dropping hints about how it’ll play and what they want players to feel. It’s not a VR game, it’s designed with complete immersion in mind, and it features creatures that behave strangely in response to generative audio cues. The team is playing around with rhythm mechanics and figuring out how to build creeping tension through sound.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>The debut game from Eyes Out will be a focused, single-player horror experience built around sound — and silence.</p><p>“I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater,” Finck said. “And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Eyes Out&#39;s first project is poised to be otherworldly, introspective and experimental, just like the studio itself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">486bf9ba-6ea0-4d85-a85a-e4f1e54ad3ff</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:45:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630513787</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:30:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[RAINER HOSCH]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eyes Out co-founders Cory Davis and Robin Finck.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eyes Out]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm aptX Lossless delivers CD quality sound over Bluetooth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, if you wanted to stream lossless audio tracks to your phone, you essentially had one option: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-tidal-master-audio-android.html"><ins>Tidal</ins></a>. A lot has changed since then, with Apple recently rolling out support for lossless streaming in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html"><ins>June</ins></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> promising to do the same later this year. But unless you’re willing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html"><ins>connect a USB DAC</ins></a> to your phone, more streaming services jumping on the Hi-Res bandwagon does you little good since Bluetooth headphones can only stream lossy audio. Thankfully, that’s about to change.</p><p>Chipmaker Qualcomm is adding a new flavor to its aptX Bluetooth codec, and it’s a lossless one that, in ideal conditions, the company claims delivers CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection. Qualcomm says it made improvements to its Bluetooth High Speed Link technology to deliver the required data throughput required to stream a lossless track wirelessly, but the codec can also compress a signal down to 24-bit 96kHz quality to ensure you don&#39;t experience any interruptions. You can also manually switch between 16-bit 44.1kHz and 24-bit 96kHz streaming modes, though the codec will automatically default to the former when it detects a lossless source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets come with support for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html"><ins>aptX codecs</ins></a> built-in. That means almost any Android phone you buy in North America or Europe will support the standard. As with all Bluetooth codecs, it’s not enough for only your phone, tablet or computer to support the technology. You also need a pair of compatible headphones or earbuds. Qualcomm says the first ones to support aptX Lossless will arrive later this year.</p><p>Before today, the closest you could get to a lossless connection over Bluetooth were Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/"><ins>LDAC</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00230269"><ins>DSEE technologies</ins></a>. Those work well, but again you need a pair of Sony headphones to take advantage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce29f72f-0c65-49b7-a8f5-1cbffa45b60e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:18:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630513134</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:19:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8d800250-0b3d-11ec-8c1e-dbe5d885186a" width="8092" height="4982" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8d800250-0b3d-11ec-8c1e-dbe5d885186a" width="8092" height="4982" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PeopleImages via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shot of a young businessman using a smartphone and headphones in the city]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Making business as easy as a day in the park]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Neo QLED 4K TVs now come in very large (and very small) sizes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is eager to court home theater enthusiasts who want high-end TVs at less-than-common sizes.

The social media giant has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/introducing-facebook-fantasy-games/">launched</a> a Fantasy Games feature in the US and Canada with &quot;free, simple&quot; sports and pop culture prediction titles. The fantasy sports  offerings let you predict winners for matches, top players and other stats. MLB Home Run Picks asks you to predict the team with the most home runs in a given day, for instance, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/espn-plus-la-liga-soccer-rights-005834427.html">La Liga</a> Winning Streak challenges you to predict daily wins in the Spanish soccer league for as long as possible.</p><p>You can also guess the victors in reality TV shows like <em>Survivor</em> and <em>The Bachelorette</em>. There are promises of other pop culture games, although Facebook didn&#39;t cite examples.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fantasy Games are currently available through Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.katana">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/facebook/id284882215">iOS</a> apps. You&#39;ll find them both through the bookmarks menu as well as through notifications in the News Feed.</p><p>Facebook clearly isn&#39;t interested in direct competition with for-money fantasy game services like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nfl-draftkings-fanduel-betting-agreement-223743539.html">DraftKings and FanDuel</a>, at least not right now. However, there are still plenty of incentives for the social network to launch Fantasy Games. The feature could keep you coming back, boosting ad revenue as well as your overall engagement with Facebook. It also opens the door to paid fantasy games in the future. Still, this might hit the spot if you&#39;ve been tempted by fantasy sports but don&#39;t want to spend real money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-fantasy-sports-pop-culture-games-142705123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fea8f738-6183-4381-971d-85e4599718a3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 14:27:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630506428</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T14:27:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fantasy Sports]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/20e87fd0-0b2b-11ec-bafd-2c6d7fa5e519" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook fantasy games for 'Survivor' and sports]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says eight states have signed up to let people store IDs in Wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Residents of some states will soon be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html"><ins>add their driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet</ins></a>, and Apple has revealed which states will support the initiative at the outset.

You’ll need to scan the card with your phone and take a selfie for verification by your state. When you tap your device at TSA checkpoints, it will display a prompt listing the info that the agency is asking for. Once you authorize the request with Face ID or Touch ID, your iPhone or Apple Watch will share those details with the TSA, so you don’t even need to show your device to an agent or scanner.</p><p>Apple says it will store your ID securely. The function will be available as part of iOS 15, which Apple will likely release this month, if past release dates are anything to go by. The latest major version of the firmware will also allow you to add work badges and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-home-keys-wwdc-2021-183759604.html"><ins>unlock some smart locks and door locks</ins></a>.

As <em>Roadshow</em><a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-self-driving-shuttles-paralympics-crash-pedestrian/">reports</a>, the automaker has <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35956185.html">resumed</a> use of its self-driving shuttle at the Paralympic Games in Tokyo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-epalette-tokyo-paralympic-games-collision-201745169.html">following a collision</a> with a visually impaired athlete. Not surprisingly, both Toyota and the games&#39; Organizing Committee have made changes in light of the crash — they&#39;ve determined that both the autonomous vehicle and the circumstances around it were to blame.</p><p>The company noted there were only two guide people at the intersection where the collision occurred, making it difficult for them to watch all vehicles and pedestrians at the same time. There also wasn&#39;t a &quot;sufficient&quot; way of coordinating between guides and vehicle operators (such as the manual &#39;backups&#39; for the e-Palette). It simply wasn&#39;t possible to ensure safety at this signal-free intersection without everyone working together, Toyota said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has upgrade the e-Palette itself with louder approach warning sounds, more crew members and tweaks to manual acceleration and braking. Organizers, meanwhile, have increased the number of guides, created an alternative to traffic signals, and split those guides into groups devoted to pedestrians and vehicles. Toyota and the Committee vowed to refine the system on a &quot;daily basis&quot; through the rest of the Paralympics, which end on September 5th.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear if these changes will be enough. However, this does serve as a reminder that self-driving vehicle tech is still in its infancy — it could be a while before Toyota and other brands can completely trust <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-toyota-denso-chip-manufacture.html">onboard computing power</a> to safely navigate streets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-resumes-self-driving-e-palette-use-paralympics-132634264.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">98c872c8-eb74-4c7a-82a3-a24378b9569f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 13:26:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630503127</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T13:32:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f20135a0-0b1f-11ec-bab7-b37093ad4a37" width="5908" height="3939" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tomohiro Ohsumi via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOKYO, JAPAN - OCTOBER 23: Toyota Motor Corp.'s e-Palette Concept autonomous vehicle is displayed during a press conference at the Tokyo Motor Show on October 23, 2019 in Tokyo, Japan.

It includes separate red, green and blue lasers so it can cover the full Rec.2020 color range, which is something even most high-end TVs cannot boast.

Running on Samsung&#39;s Tizen operating system for smart TVs, you can ask Alexa, the Google Assistant or Bixby to do things for you as well as stream from services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV+ and others.

Because I apparently lack any amount of common sense, I recently took a 3,000-mile RV trip with my partner and two toddlers. Traveling with little ones can be stressful because they rely so much on their established routines; anything that deviates from that is going to be hard for them and you.</p><p>While we tried to maintain a semblance of normalcy by bringing along familiar toys and blankets, we also took the advice of a close friend who is an early childhood development specialist. She recommended keeping our twins engaged and entertained by grouping toys or activities together and rotating them throughout the day. Here are a few things that we tried that we’ll be returning to the next time we travel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Music</h2><p>Depending on how you’re traveling, music can be a great way to entertain tiny travelers. The repetition in children’s songs help kids learn patterns and expand their vocabulary. What’s more, musical play encourages movement along with both fine and gross motor skills. That’s great if you’re in a car where you can clap, sing and wiggle, but gets more challenging when you’re stuck on an aircraft with dozens of other people who don’t want to hear “Old MacDonald” seven(-ty-seven) times in a row.</p><h3>Instruments</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5a817050-0a70-11ec-bedf-f60dcbd0a7c3" style="height:969;width:1400;" alt="Sesame Street Music Player" data-uuid="6cad224e-2da6-3338-b521-462f40a2828e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sesame Street</div></figure><p>My mom bought us this “<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:CD player" href="https://amzn.to/38qfK8Z">CD player</a>” for our trip and weeks later, the twins are still fighting over it. My daughter really likes the music, my son really likes taking the “CD” out repeatedly to figure out how the player works, and they both like the colorful book of lyrics. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fisher Price" href="https://amzn.to/38lKNmo">Fisher Price</a> has a similar option with light-up buttons, which is perfect for occupying little hands.</p><p>Another cool gadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-educational-toys-for-kids-123055311.html">we’ve recommended</a> in the past is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Blipbox" href="https://amzn.to/3kyCTvE">Blipbox</a>, an entry-level synthesizer that comes with 300 melodies and a synchronized light show.

We still have a classical playlist of songs for when it’s time to sleep, but I also keep a playlist of songs that are entertaining for adult passengers as well (think: “Yellow Submarine” and songs by They Might Be Giants). It’s nice both to switch up the endless parade of nursery rhymes and expose them to different types of music.</p><h3>YouTube playlists</h3><p>On the other hand, kids respond to nursery rhymes because they incorporate simple melodies, repetition and actions (some of which can be easy to do while seated). YouTube has dozens of long playlists of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlvIFV_8v7Q">classic nursery rhymes</a>, some of which include the lyrics, which is helpful if you’re like me and have long forgotten the words to “Three Blind Mice.”</p><h3>Podcasts</h3><p>Older kids might enjoy one of the many educational podcasts out there. As a bonus, if they’re able to keep headphones on for a decent stretch of time, this makes for a good airplane option, too. As an avid podcast fan myself, I’m excited for my twins to be old enough to enjoy them with me, and I’ve already bookmarked several to try out. The <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/474377890/but-why-a-podcast-for-curious-kids">But Why?</a> podcast from NPR answers questions that kids send in themselves from “how do you make ice cream?” to “why do we wear clothes?” If your kid is into science, try <a href="https://www.brainson.org/episodes">Brains On</a> or <a href="https://www.sciencepodcastforkids.com/">Tumble</a> to explore topics like “how far can a cloud travel?’ and “how to become an astronaut.”</p><p>For more narrative style podcasts, check out <a href="https://www.littlestoriestinypeople.com/">Little Stories for Tiny People</a> or <a href="https://bedtime.fm/storytime">Story Time</a>. And for those kids, and parents, who are into exploring different musical genres, there’s <a href="https://saturdaycerealbowl.podbean.com/">the Saturday Morning Cereal Bowl</a> and <a href="https://sparetherock.com/wordpress/">Spare the Rock, Spoil the Child</a> podcasts, which feature songs from the Orb, Cake and Bob Marley.</p><h2>Interactive</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818d8bc0-df5a-11eb-bf7f-16d114f3b674" style="height:1200;width:2000;" alt="Montessori Busy Board for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="29271609-9441-3879-ab86-e71cee7c7280"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / deMoca</div></figure><p>Being stuck in a car or plane seat for long periods of time can make it challenging to find activities that involve younger kids’ need to explore, but there are still a few options. Most notably, a kids camera, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Action Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3gEu1Up">Action Cam</a> or the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Creator Cam" href="https://amzn.to/3jybefm">Creator Cam</a> from VTech, can help them stay amused. They can document the trip with photos, videos and use stop-motion or time-lapse effects. The Action Cam can be mounted on a bike and comes with a waterproof case, while the Creator Cam comes with a small tripod and includes more than 20 animated backgrounds that the kids can use to spice up their photos and videos.</p><p>For kids younger than the recommended age for a camera, I like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:busy boards" href="https://amzn.to/3zp3FNo">busy boards</a>.
