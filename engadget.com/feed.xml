Four employees tested positive right after Black Friday, <em>NBC</em> learned, and the cases appear to have spread.</p><p>Affected workers will have to isolate for 10 days and go two days without symptoms before they can return,  according to a virtual team meeting. Everyone returning on the 13th will have to take a rapid antigen COVID-19 test the day before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are concerns the outbreak might have been avoidable. One worker at Southlake said it was difficult to maintain social distancing even before Black Friday, while others said they were encouraged to come to work even when they reported COVID-like symptoms in a mandatory survey. Staffers were also incorrectly told they couldn&#39;t claim special sick leave unless they tested positive.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment on these reports. In a statement to <em>NBC</em>, a spokesperson focused on an overall &quot;comprehensive approach&quot; to safety that included regular testing, masks, cleaning and paid leave.</p><p>Apple has faced accusations of poor retail employee treatment in the past, including (discontinued) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-offers-30-million-to-settle-off-the-clock-bag-search-controversy-084819770.html">off-the-clock bag searches</a>. There may be multiple factors at work in this case, however. Whether or not the leadership was responsible, staff are reportedly concerned there&#39;s too much pressure to meet certain sales targets. Managers may feel compelled to put sick staff to work rather than risk falling short of store goals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-store-covid-19-outbreak-221248408.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2cbea19-8684-4336-8806-1974b2ef42b5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 22:12:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639087970</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T22:13:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/50429690-5936-11ec-97dd-80ff98ff93f9" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/50429690-5936-11ec-97dd-80ff98ff93f9" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Octavio Jones via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TAMPA, FL - NOVEMBER 26: The Apple store employee helps customers during Black Friday at International Plaza on November 26, 2021 in Tampa, United States.

Farley noted during the show that full production capacity for the Lightning currently sits at “70,000 or 80,000 units.&quot; Don&#39;t fret if you&#39;re already on the reservation list, Ford is already looking for ways to boost its EV output.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re going to try to double that,” Farley told <em>CNBC</em> host Jim Cramer. “We’ve done it in the past.

It&#39;s an upgraded version of the Instant Pot Duo, adding a lid that automatically seals shut when you close it. It&#39;s a 7-in-1 device, combining a pressure cooker, yogurt maker, rice cooker, cake maker, slow cooker, egg cooker and sauté machine into one. You&#39;re also getting a number of different one-touch cooking programs for things like soup, meat and stew, porridge and more, taking even more of the guesswork out of preparing a meal for your family. And with the 8-quart model, you&#39;ll be able to prepare a lot of food — it&#39;s arguably the best size for large families and those who entertain often.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html">Instant Pot models</a> has grown over the years to the point that there&#39;s almost a confusing number of these devices available. Some are more straightforward than others, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Duo Crisp" href="https://amzn.to/33h1eBl">Duo Crisp</a>, which includes an air-fry mode and comes with the appropriate lid for it. But the Duo Nova remains a solid option for newbies as it combines the convenience of a pressure cooker with a bunch of other functions in a relatively counter-friendly appliance. You may need to make a bit more space for the 8-quart model in your kitchen, but it&#39;s a small price to pay for all of the cooking time you&#39;ll get back while using it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-8-quart-instant-pot-duo-nova-is-on-sale-for-59-right-now-162214336.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba148b4a-9497-4ca7-ad9a-f1472d306749</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 16:22:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639067022</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T16:23:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599c2380-590b-11ec-ba7b-13a7230cc18a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599c2380-590b-11ec-ba7b-13a7230cc18a" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instant Pot / Walmart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instant Pot Duo Nova Walmart model]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instant Pot Duo Nova Walmart model]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura dies at 78]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s a sad moment for gamers. <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/masayuki-uemura-creator-of-the-nes-and-snes-dies-at-7-1848184264">reports</a> Masayuki Uemura, the lead creator of the Famicom and Super Famicom (aka NES and SNES), <a href="https://www-rcgs-jp.translate.goog/?p=1598&amp;_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US">died</a> on December 6th at the age of 78. He started working at Sharp, where he sold solar cell and light sensor technology, but he&#39;s best remembered for a long and highly influential run at Nintendo that effectively revived the video game industry following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-01-true-story-et-atari.html">the 1983 crash</a>.</p><p>Uemura first became involved with Nintendo after the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2007-10-04-gunpei-yokoi-passed-10-years-ago-today.html">Gunpei Yokoi</a> asked about using Sharp solar cells to produce light gun games. The future console designer joined Nintendo in 1971, and the company released gun games that included a home-friendly game called <em>Duck Hunt</em> (yes, the predecessor of the NES title). Company president Hiroshi Yamauchi put Uemura in charge of the R&amp;D2 division responsible for hardware, including consoles, and in November 1981 famously called Uemura asking him to  build a machine that lets you play arcade games on your TV. The result was 1983&#39;s Famicom, the system that would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-designer-lance-barr-retires-145657155.html">become the NES</a> outside of Japan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You know at least some of what happened next. The Famicom and NES were wild successes, selling nearly 62 million units combined and rejuvenating interest in home consoles. Uemura then led work on the Super Famicom, whose global launch as the SNES further cemented Nintendo&#39;s reputation. He also produced some NES games, including <em>Ice Climber</em> and three sports titles. He retired from Nintendo in 2004, but continued to serve as an advisor and would go on to teach and research video games as a professor at Ritsumeikan University.</p><p>It&#39;s hard to overstate Uemura&#39;s influence. The video game business as it exists today arguably owes much to the skill of Uemura and his team when they designed their first TV consoles. He also helped grow Japan&#39;s overall tech industry by making Nintendo a global force in electronics. While he certainly wasn&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-12-nintendo-chief-satoru-iwata-dies.html">star at Nintendo</a>, he was one of the most directly influential.</p><div id="342235b5ea8b49fc8380a71e4ad026aa"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9pBV2uc7Jc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-creator-masayuki-uemura-dies-142518818.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a2e3320-9b4a-4b70-8f9e-6bfbbe8fab3a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639059994</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T14:26:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e1071370-58f2-11ec-bef3-ed6090d6066b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e1071370-58f2-11ec-bef3-ed6090d6066b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANA Global]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NES and SNES creator Masayuki Uemura]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shark's robot vacuum with AI navigation is 30 percent off today at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The holiday shopping season is one of the best times of the year to look for a robot vacuum. Since many are quite expensive, you&#39;ll usually find good discounts during this time, and even some of the most budget-friendly models can be on sale. Today, Amazon has a one-day sale on a mid-range Shark robo-vac that brings the machine down to its lowest price yet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark AV2001 robot vacuum" href="https://amzn.to/3GsYsan">Shark AV2001 robot vacuum</a> with AI navigation is on sale for $300, or $130 off its normal price.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GsYsan" id="cb4688e4c458484daf6e424d77475220" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark AV2001 at Amazon - $300</a><p>Shark took the top spot in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>, and this model is more advanced and has more suction power than the one we tested. It has a self-cleaning brush roll that will help it pick up debris and even pet hair more easily, and it supports UltraClean Mode, which lets you deep clean specific rooms of your home. It moves through your home in neat rows thanks to its AI laser navigation system and it should bump into furniture less than other robo-vacs thanks to its ability to detect and avoid objects four inches high or taller.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AV2001 also has precision home mapping with LiDAR, which means it&#39;ll learn the layout of your home as it cleans the first few times. You can then use the companion mobile app to send the machine to clean your bedroom only, and you can also set &quot;no-go&quot; zones to block off certain areas. The mobile app also lets you control the robot from anywhere and set cleaning schedules, and since it&#39;s compatible with Alexa and the Google Assistant, you could do all that with voice commands if you prefer. While it doesn&#39;t have a clean base like some higher-end robot vacuums do, it does come with a dock that it&#39;ll automatically return to once it&#39;s done cleaning or when it&#39;s battery has run low. All of those features make it a pretty capable robo-vac and a good option if you&#39;ve been holding out for a good deal on a mid-range device.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-robot-vacuum-with-ai-navigation-is-30-percent-off-today-at-amazon-140021143.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">504086ec-b506-4c73-b263-4aa3445700a9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639057479</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T13:44:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/131e56f0-58f5-11ec-b06e-cbf7c14e9094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/131e56f0-58f5-11ec-b06e-cbf7c14e9094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark AV2001 robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark AV2001 robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tinder's 'Music Mode' is like a mixtape from potential dates]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In partnership with Spotify, Tinder has introduced Music Mode as part of its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tinder-video-profile-update-130041493.html">Explore</a> section, letting you hear the &quot;Anthem&quot; songs of members when you swipe to their profiles — a sort of mixtape for dates, if you will.

While sending USDP via Novi on WhatsApp has extremely limited availability for now, Kasriel said the service will look to expand its reach after getting feedback from users about the experience.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-novi-money-transfers-us-124027874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74068a86-ae34-461a-8ae0-322bdf1c53f0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 12:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639054244</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T12:50:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a8bf1bc0-58e3-11ec-bfb7-80d315f8be2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a8bf1bc0-58e3-11ec-bfb7-80d315f8be2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Future iOS update will help you spot third-party iPhone parts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple’s incoming iOS 15.2 update includes a &quot;parts and service history&quot; section that indicates not only if the battery, camera and display have been replaced but also if they&#39;re <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html">officially sanctioned Apple parts</a>.

It was established in 1996 and became famous sometime ago for analyzing web traffic and listing the most popular websites around the world. The service also offers paid subscriptions for those who want detailed SEO analytics and insights.

Amazon holds a position of &quot;absolute dominance&quot; in the Italian brokerage services market, &quot;which has allowed it to promote its own logistics service, called Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA),&quot; the authority wrote in a (Google translated) press release.</p><p>According to the AGCM, companies must use Amazon&#39;s FBA service if they want access to key benefits like the Prime label, which in turn allows them to participate in Black Friday sales and other key events. &quot;Amazon has thus prevented third-party sellers from associating the Prime label with offers not managed with FBA,&quot; it said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The authority said access to those functions are &quot;crucial&quot; for seller success. It also noted that third-party sellers using FBA are not subject to the same stringent performance requirements as non-FBA sellers. As such, they&#39;re less likely to be suspended from the platform if they fail to meet certain goals. Finally, it noted that sellers using Amazon&#39;s logistics services are discouraged from offering their products on other online platforms, at least to the same extent they do on Amazon.&nbsp;</p><p>The AGCM said it imposed the steep fine as it considered Amazon&#39;s actions to be &quot;particularly serious&quot; given  their duration and the effects they&#39;ve caused. On top of the fine, it has demanded that Amazon grant the privileges enjoyed by FBA sellers to all third-party sellers, provided they respect other rules and laws. It will have to define and publish those standards within a year, and its actions will be enforced by a monitoring trustee.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, an Amazon spokesperson said the company &quot;strongly disagreed&quot; with the decision and will appeal. It also noted that non-FBA sellers can use its Seller Fulfilled Prime (SFP) service, which gives them access to Prime benefits without having to use Amazon’s logistics services.</p><blockquote><p>We strongly disagree with the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) and we will appeal. The proposed fine and remedies are unjustified and disproportionate. More than half of all annual sales on Amazon in Italy come from SMBs, and their success is at the heart of our business model. Small and medium-sized businesses have multiple channels to sell their products both online and offline: Amazon is just one of those options. We constantly invest to support the growth of the 18,000 Italian SMBs that sell on Amazon, and we provide multiple tools to our sellers, including those who manage shipments themselves.</p></blockquote><p>Last month, Amazon and Apple were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html">fined $228 million</a> in Italy for unfairly restricting Beats sales by limiting them to select retailers.

When data from all those telescopes is combined, NASA can form images that could give us more insight into how mysterious celestial objects — those that emit X-ray — work.

Martin Weisskopf, the mission&#39;s principal investigator, said during a briefing: &quot;IXPE will help us test and refine our current theories of how the universe works.

Unfortunately for Mosseri, members of the subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security came to the hearing armed with fresh anecdotes from their own finstas.</p><p>During the hearing, Mosseri’s first time appearing in Congress, multiple senators revealed that they and their staffs had created fresh Instagram accounts disguised as teenagers. They all said that the app had steered them toward content that was inappropriate for young users, including “anorexia coaches,” and other content related to self harm.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The staff of one lawmaker, Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn, managed to uncover a significant bug in one of Instagram&#39;s teen safety features. Blackburn said that her staff created a fresh account as a 15-year old-girl, but that the account defaulted to public, not private. Instagram said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html">in July</a> that teens younger than 16 signing up for the first time would be defaulted to private accounts.</p><p>“While Instagram is touting all these safety measures, they aren&#39;t even making sure that the safety measures are in effect for me,” Blackburn said. Mosseri later confirmed that the company had mistakenly not enabled the private default settings for new accounts created on the web. “We will correct that quickly,” he said.</p><p>Blackburn wasn’t the only senator who came to the hearing prepared with questions about what they saw on a staff-created finsta. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal said that his staff had created a new account posing as 13-year-old just days before. He said after following “a few accounts promoting eating disorders,” that “within an hour, all of our recommendations promoted pro-anorexia and eating disorder content.” He later added that a search for self harm content turned up results so graphic he didn’t feel he could describe them.</p><p>It was a notable shift from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html">cringeworthy moment</a> at a September hearing, when Blumenthal clumsily pushed Facebook’s Head of Safety, Antigone Davis, on whether she could “commit to ending finsta.” This time, Blumenthal pressed Mosseri on whether he would commit to ending work on Instagram Kids entirely — Mosseri did not — and whether he would make more data about Instagram’s algorithms available to researchers outside the company.</p><p>“I can commit to you today that we will provide meaningful access to data so that third party researchers can design their own studies and make their own conclusions about the effects of well being on young people,” Mosseri said. He later added that Instagram is working on giving users the option for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-will-bring-back-a-chronological-feed-in-2022-211232214.html">chronological feed</a>.</p><p>Utah Senator Mike Lee also shared his experience creating an Instagram account for a fictitious 13-year-old girl. He described how the recommendations in the account’s Explore page changed after following just one account. “The Explore page yielded fairly benign results at first,” he said. “We followed the first account that was recommended by Instagram, which happened to be a very famous female celebrity. After following that account, we went back to the Explore page and the content quickly changed.</p><p>“Why did following Instagrams top recommended account for a 13-year-old girl cause our Explore page to go from showing really innocuous things, like hairstyling videos, to content that promotes body dysmorphia. sexualization of women and content otherwise unsuitable for a 13 year old girl?”</p><p>Mosseri replied that, according to the company’s Community Standards Enforcement report, content promoting eating disorders accounts for “roughly five out of every 10,000 things viewed.” Lee didn’t buy it. “It went dark fast,” he said. “It was not five in 1,000 or five in 10,000, it was rampant.”</p><p>While much of what the senators described was similar to what journalists and others have reported experiencing on Instagram, the exchanges were telling because they underscored a point that’s been raised by whistleblower Frances Haugen and others studying the company: That Facebook often uses <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/">deceptive statistics</a> to mask its problems. And that the sheer size of the platform means that even relatively low amounts of harmful content can have an outsize impact on users.&nbsp;</p><p>It also indicated just how seriously lawmakers are taking the issue of teen safety and social media. While previous hearings with big tech executives have often veered wildly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">off topic</a>, senators stayed relatively focused on the issues. And it was clear that there was bipartisan agreement on the need for Instagram to disclose more information about its platform to the public and to researchers.</p><p>“I would support federal legislation around the transparency of data, or the access to data from researchers, and around the prevalence of content problems on the platform,” Mosseri said. But Blumenthal pushed back, saying Instagram’s previous actions haven’t gone far enough.</p><p>“​​The kinds of baby steps that you&#39;ve suggested so far, very respectfully, are underwhelming,” Blumenthal said at the close of the hearing. “I think you will sense on this committee, pretty strong determination to do something well beyond what you&#39;ve indicated you have in mind. That&#39;s the reason that I think self-policing based on trust is no longer a viable solution.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92bc844d-10b4-4272-9e97-eaf8b0fa8e78</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Dec 2021 00:17:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639073276</ingested><modified>2021-12-09T18:08:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fca7a240-5882-11ec-8677-40b30d1bfaf5" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - DECEMBER 08: Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri testifies at a Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security Subcommittee hearing on "Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users" on Capitol Hill in Washington D.C., United States on December 08, 2021.

But if you end up being that unlucky soul, it turns out Twitter is prepared to help you survive the potential trolling onslaught. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-08/twitter-s-highest-profile-users-get-vip-treatment-when-trolls-strike"><em>Bloomberg reports</em></a>, the company has developed Project Guardian, an internal list of thousands of accounts who could potentially be attacked by other users. Being on that list fast-tracks any complaints related to those users on Twitter&#39;s moderation systems.</p><p>While it may sound a bit suspect, the big takeaway from <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> reporting is that Project Guardian is just a predictive aspect of Twitter&#39;s security measures. And unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html">Facebook&#39;s treatment of VIP&#39;s</a>, which has been criticized for allowing celebrities and politicians to break that platform&#39;s rules, Twitter&#39;s system doesn&#39;t  necessarily grant more privileges to users.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Project Guardian also includes some well-known athletes, media personalities and politicians, but Yoel Roth, Twitter&#39;s head of site integrity, tells <em>Bloomberg</em> that the list doesn&#39;t include famous users. As, as we mentioned, it also helps to protect normal people who end up going viral.</p><p>“The reason this concept existed is because of the ‘person of the day’ phenomenon,” Roth said. “And on that basis, there are some people who are the ‘person of the day’ most days, and so Project Guardian would be one way to protect them.”</p><p>In an ideal world, Twitter would be able to give every user the same amount of security support. But, as <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, the company currently receives too many moderation requests to manage that. Perhaps that&#39;s an argument that user safety should be scaled in proportion with user growth. And while Project Guardian helps to protect some users, it&#39;s also a smart way for Twitter to squash harassment that could also hurt its own image. You could argue that&#39;s true for practically every security measure a social media company takes, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-project-guardian-vip-safety-220809710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff63f14e-c6c5-4444-bc1d-54b09cb4bc48</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 22:08:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639001291</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T22:08:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/d4ec5ef0-bf33-11eb-bbff-0def069971a4" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 14, 2021.

The organization, which is a coalition of labor unions, analyzed more than 130,000 search results and found that about 28 percent of the results you see on Amazon represent ads. What’s more, SOC says those ads don’t comply with FTC guidelines designed to make it possible for consumers to distinguish between sponsored content and organic search results.</p><p>In 2013, the agency <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-consumer-protection-staff-updates-agencys-guidance-search-engine-industryon-need-distinguish/130625searchenginegeneralletter.pdf"><ins>said</ins></a> companies should feature prominent shading or borders, in addition to clear text that is properly situated and sized to avoid confusion. SOC found that zero percent of Amazon’s advertisements featured prominent shading and only about 1.1 percent had an easily distinguished border. When it came to the company’s use of “sponsored” labels, SOC found that in about 22 percent of ads the disclosure was buried under more prominent labels, such as ones that said “Highly rated” and “Today’s deals.” Additionally, those disclosures used a font that was smaller and lighter than the ones the company employed to advertise if a product was liked by other customers or part of a deal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Elsewhere, SOC claims Amazon employs a technique called “lazy loading” where sponsored labels take longer to appear, particularly on slower internet connections. Using a 12 to 25Mbps connection, the organization found those labels could take up to three seconds longer to load than the top banner ad. We’ll note here we had difficulty verifying that claim at Engadget.</p><p>SOC has asked the FTC to take “aggressive and swift action” against the company. &quot;Amazon’s violations are so omnipresent that Amazon’s representation that its platform presents ‘search results’ to consumers is itself deceptive,&quot; it said.</p><p>Amazon disputes SOC&#39;s findings. “This report is incorrect and misunderstands FTC guidance – ads in Amazon’s store always include a clear and prominent ‘sponsored’ label, implemented in accordance with FTC guidelines,” an Amazon spokesperson told Engadget. “We design our store to help customers discover products we think may best meet their needs – sponsored ads is one of the ways to help them find products they may be interested in.”</p><p>It’s hard to say if the FTC will take up SOC’s complaint against Amazon. And, even if it does, what kind of action it could take against the company. Part of the problem here is that the agency’s own guidelines leave some room open for interpretation.</p><p>“We understand that there is not any one specific method for clearly and prominently distinguishing advertising from natural search results, and that search engines may develop new methods for distinguishing advertising results,” the FTC said in 2013. “Any method may be used, so long as it is noticeable and understandable to consumers.”</p><p>At the same time, this is exactly the kind of issue the agency is likely willing to take up under recently appointed chair <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html"><ins>Lina Khan</ins></a>.
