That&#39;s a particularly challenging task, however, that requires dexterity, safety and speed. Now, scientists at MIT CSAIL have developed an algorithm that strikes a balance by allowing for non-harmful impacts rather than not permitting any impacts at all as before.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans are hardwired to accommodate and adjust to other humans, but robots have to learn all that from scratch. For example, it&#39;s relatively easy for a person to help someone else dress, as we know instinctively where to hold the clothing item, how people can bend their arms, how cloth reacts and more. However, robots have to be programmed with all that information.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2aafa51cf73346e498eb0f7a1065b79d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9JrDMBg2HE?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In the past, algorithms have prevented robots from making any impact with humans at all in the interest of safety. However, that can lead to something called the &quot;freezing robot&quot; problem, where the robot essentially stops moving and can&#39;t accomplish the task it set out to do.&nbsp;</p><p>To get past that issue, an MIT CSAIL team led by PhD student Shen Li developed an algorithm that redefines robotic motion safety by allowing for &quot;safe impacts&quot; on top of collision avoidance. This lets the robot make non-harmful contact with a human to achieve its task, as long as its impact on the human is low.</p><p>&quot;Developing algorithms to prevent physical harm without unnecessarily impacting the task efficiency is a critical challenge,&quot; said Li. &quot;By allowing robots to make non-harmful impact with humans, our method can find efficient robot trajectories to dress the human with a safety guarantee.&quot;</p><p>For a simple dressing task, the system worked even if the person was doing other activities like checking a phone, as shown in the video above. It does that by combining multiple models for different situations, rather than relying on a single model as before. &quot;This multifaceted approach combines set theory, human-aware safety constraints, human motion prediction and feedback control for safe human-robot interaction,&quot; said Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Zackory Erickson.</p><p>The research is still in the early stages, but the ideas could be used areas other than just dressing. &quot;This research could potentially be applied to a wide variety of assistive robotics scenarios, towards the ultimate goal of enabling robots to provide safer physical assistance to people with disabilities,&quot; Erickson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-csail-unveils-a-robot-that-helps-the-infirmed-dress-themselves-120016438.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">150237df-ad42-4411-9fee-574701281407</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626087445</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T10:57:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Finally, Virgin Galactic completes its first crewed spaceflight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After oh so many delays, training up its founder, Sir Richard Branson, and some delightful, sometimes petty, banter with Blue Origin (love those “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html https://www.engadget.com/...">largest windows in space</a>” claims), Virgin Galactic has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html https://www.engadget.com/...">made it into space.</a></p><p>Or at least, it did, depending on who you ask.

The first, the weekly series <a href="https://www.clubhouse.com/event/mZb22V1y"><em>Thank Your Ass Off</em></a>, debuts through the platform on July 12th at 11AM Eastern.</p><p>The arrangement lets TED sell ads and sponsorships for its conversations.

The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-firms-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-on-behalf-of-taiwans-government-11626020496">reports</a> that the two companies have agreed to buy 10 million Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine doses on behalf of Taiwan&#39;s government. The two are purchasing the shots from Fosun Pharmaceutical, the vaccine&#39;s exclusive distributor across the Greater China region, after China allegedly &quot;spiked&quot; Taiwan&#39;s bid to directly buy the vaccine.</p><p>There was pressure to make a deal. Taiwan has largely kept COVID-19 levels low throughout the pandemic, but new cases started surging in late April and prompted rare restrictions on the island. While infections are dropping, Taiwan has only vaccinated about 14 percent of its population. It will need many more doses if it&#39;s going to lift restrictions while keeping cases low.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tech companies like have offered to buy vaccines for employees and contractors before. Apple helped TSMC buy vaccines for its staff, for instance. A purchase this large for the general population breaks new ground, however — the companies are buying enough doses to inject over 40 percent of Taiwan&#39;s 24 million people.</p><p>Foxconn and TSMC have strong incentives to step in. Outbreaks could hurt their operations, even for those factories and other facilities beyond Taiwan. That could be particularly dangerous amid a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-macbook-assembly-delayed-global-chip-shortage-115005064.html">global chip shortage</a> and other manufacturing headaches — mass infections and shutdowns could cause further snarls.

As <em>AV Club</em><a href="https://www.avclub.com/marvel-says-black-widow-made-60-million-on-disney-plus-1847269075?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=avclub">reports</a>, Disney has <a href="https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/black-widow-surpasses-215m-between-box-office-and-disney-plus-premier-access">revealed</a> that Marvel blockbuster <em>Black Widow</em> raked in more than $60 million in estimated revenue solely from customers paying $30 each for Premier Access. That&#39;s more than a quarter of the roughly $215 million Disney expected to make from all sources, including US and international box office sales.</p><p>The company also bragged that <em>Black Widow</em> was the largest US box office opening during the COVID-19 pandemic, just besting <em>F9</em>. That wasn&#39;t difficult, though, given that movie theaters have routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amc-avoids-bankruptcy-with-funding-164243952.html">struggled to attract viewers</a> when they weren&#39;t dealing with widespread closures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on Disney providing Premier Access figures on a regular basis, especially as the pandemic continues to (hopefully) subside and more people are comfortable venturing to theaters. To some extent, the media giant needed the $60 million number to make <em>Black Widow</em>&#39;s debut sound more impressive. We&#39;d add that it&#39;s difficult to compare this against data for rivals like Amazon and Netflix. They don&#39;t have equivalents to Premier Access, so they measure success for original movies largely in terms of viewership and new subscriptions.</p><p>Nonetheless, this represents an important milestone for Disney as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-focuses-on-streaming-203003919.html">shifts toward streaming</a>. It&#39;s now comfortable mentioning Premier Access numbers after months of staying quiet. Even if Premier Access fades into the background, it&#39;s now a significant part of Disney&#39;s movie release strategy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1b5365f-504c-425e-ae86-797df877d054</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 17:46:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626025595</ingested><modified>2021-07-11T17:46:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4ffb4490-e26a-11eb-a3bb-79ed7fcceb53" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4ffb4490-e26a-11eb-a3bb-79ed7fcceb53" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jay Maidment/Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Scarlett Johansson in Marvel movie 'Black Widow']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Scarlett Johansson in Marvel movie 'Black Widow']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['FIFA 22' brings more realistic soccer to next-gen consoles on October 1st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EA isn&#39;t just giving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/madden-nfl-22-release-date-152359613.html"><em>Madden NFL</em></a> players an upgrade if they play on next-gen consoles.

However, it is clear that the gaming giant wants to offer a strong incentive to play on newer machines.

Former staff <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-10/kaseya-failed-to-address-security-before-hack-ex-employees-say">talking</a> to <em>Bloomberg</em> claim they warned executives of &quot;critical&quot; security flaws in Kaseya&#39;s products several times between 2017 and 2020, but that the company didn&#39;t truly address them. Multiple staff either quit or said they were fired over inaction.</p><p>Employees reportedly complained that Kaseya was using old code, implemented poor encryption and even failed to routinely patch software. The company&#39;s Virtual System Administrator (VSA), the remote maintenance tool that fell prey to ransomware, was supposedly rife with enough problems that workers wanted the software replaced.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One employee claimed he was fired two weeks after sending executives a 40-page briefing on security problems. Others simply left in frustration with a seeming focus on new features and releases instead of fixing basic issues.

It fixed some problems after Dutch researchers pointed out vulnerabilities. It didn&#39;t fix everything, however, and it didn&#39;t take long before analyst firms like Truesec found glaring flaws in Kaseya&#39;s platform. This wasn&#39;t the first time Kaseya faced security issues, either. The company&#39;s software was reportedly used to launch ransomware at least twice between 2018 and 2019, and it didn&#39;t significantly rethink its security strategy.</p><p>However accurate the reports may be, Kaseya&#39;s situation wouldn&#39;t be unique. Staff at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-customer-support-compromised-solarwinds-hackers-033613290.html">SolarWinds</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bitcoin-scam-social-engineering-hack-access-193040357.html">Twitter</a> and others have described security lapses that weren&#39;t fixed in time. That just makes the situation worse, mind you. It suggests that key parts of American online infrastructure have been vulnerable due to neglect, and that these basic missteps are all too common.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-warned-of-security-flaws-before-ransomware-210226358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f7c076c-59eb-44ce-8f8a-9567849cec7a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 21:02:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625950949</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T21:02:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/898ecaf0-e1bc-11eb-ae12-0e6aaa2d983e" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/898ecaf0-e1bc-11eb-ae12-0e6aaa2d983e" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kaseya logo and binary code seen in this illustration taken, July 5, 2021.

According to Cherlynn Low, iPhone users have a lot to look forward to later this year. Meanwhile, Nicole Lee set up both the 8- and 5-inch Echo Shows in her house to check out Amazon’s updates, and she says the Echo Show 8 is now much improved for video calls. Also, Daniel Cooper found a lot to like about the Lenovo Legion 5, but he admits the laptop comes with some compromises.</p><h2>There’s a lot to explore in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">the public beta of iOS 15</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/60f3f930-e0e0-11eb-a7f7-3812ce1e1d41" alt="iOS 15 beta" data-uuid="afd3c4c6-c374-3a05-9c8c-75aa2dcf2299"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>After spending a few weeks testing the latest iOS 15 features, including SharePlay and Focus modes, Cherlynn Low concluded that Apple lovers will have a bunch of new things to try out this fall. As most of the changes are already available, it’s perhaps not surprising that the beta is fairly complete. While testing SharePlay, Cherlynn encountered a few minor glitches. It was difficult to figure out how to access the feature initially because the options only show up when a compatible media app is open during a chat. And both parties will need a subscription to stream together on Apple TV+ or Apple Music.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cherlynn particularly liked the Focus modes, which let users create customized profiles that only allow notifications from selected apps or people to come through. You can also pick a Home screen that will only show the apps you want. In this mode, you won’t see any other pages — just the apps drawer and the Today screen — keeping distractions to a minimum.</p><p>Other upgrades include Live Text, which scans photos for usable text like foreign words on a menu to translate; richer and more detailed Maps; better Spotlight search and Share With You, which consolidates media your friends send you. Cherlynn said there’s much more to explore in the Weather, Safari and Wallet apps that should give fans a taste of the full release. She also spent time with the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8 beta</a>, which brings more health and fitness tools, improved communication and better integration with connected appliances to the Apple Watch.</p><h2>Amazon&#39;s latest Echo Shows are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">pretty familiar, and that&#39;s ok</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5c58910-e0e0-11eb-bfbf-28b50b7ef173" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8 and Show 5" data-uuid="a99896b2-dda6-335f-9614-b86c01d71294"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicole Lee/Engadget</div></figure><p>Amazon didn’t change much on the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3xnC7Xe">$129 Echo Show 8</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Show 5" href="https://amzn.to/3iM7V3S">$85 Show 5</a>, and Nicole Lee says that’s just fine. The two devices eschew the swiveling screen found in the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 10" href="https://amzn.to/3ww1oOe">Echo Show 10</a> and keep much of what worked in previous models: the minimalist design, an ambient light sensor to adjust brightness and color temperature and a camera shutter for privacy. The Echo Show 8 has a 1,280 x 800 resolution display while the Show 5 features a 960 x 480 screen, and the latter is clearly intended as more of a nightstand device. Nicole was particularly pleased by the sound quality on the Echo Show 8, which delivered powerful bass and impressive volume.</p><p>And because it now features an octa-core processor and a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera, the Echo Show 8 is now more useful for video calls. The camera also has digital panning and zooming technology so it can follow you during video calls, although in Nicole’s experience, this took a few seconds to kick in. But the Show 8 won’t be best for all your video needs as it lacks native YouTube as well as streaming support for Disney+, Paramount+ and HBO Max. If you’re already in the Amazon ecosystem, she says the Echo Show 8 delivers the most value for the money — but if you’re looking for something akin to an alarm clock, the Show 5 is a better choice.</p><h2>Lenovo&#39;s Legion 5 Pro is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html">affordable gaming laptop with great graphics</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/15520b60-d033-11eb-bdb7-2df4ef554571" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Review image of the new Lenovo Legion 5 Pro (2021)" data-uuid="a73b2c79-761d-341a-a190-be99f577b6e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Though Lenovo isn’t best known for its gaming laptops, Daniel Cooper points out that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Legion 5 Pro" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=buyersguide2021&amp;subId3=Review-LenovoLegion5Pro&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-Pro-16-0-AMD-Ryzen-7-5800H-16GB-512GB-NVMe-TLC-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070-Windows-10-Home-82JQ008NUS%2F231609645%3F">Legion 5 Pro</a> laptop is clearly trying to capture more of that attention. With AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H and NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 graphics, the machine is powerful — and at $1,530, it’s relatively affordable as well. Daniel points out that the 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD are underwhelming, but they can be upgraded, and the 16-inch, 165Hz QHD IPS display holds its own in bright light and reduces glare.</p><p>When it comes to design, users get a solid aluminum chassis with a professional looking matte grey paint job, plus a plethora of ports including four USB-A, two USB-C, HDMI, Ethernet and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Daniel said that typing on Lenovo’s TrueStrike keyboard is a unique experience: the “soft landing” switches makes each actuation feel a bit deeper than the keys 1.5mm depth. He was less fond of the 720p webcam, which produces fuzzy images with light blooms, and the heat produced by the fan system was noticeable. However, the big compromise on the Legion 5 is the battery life — the machine lasted only 4 hours and 43 minutes during testing, which makes it most useful when near an outlet.</p><h2>The Fitbit Luxe is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-review-small-fitness-tracker-150008620.html">impressively small fitness tracker</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c6fe7e10-e0e2-11eb-b95f-740ff4305eb3" alt="Fitbit Luxe" data-uuid="3adb2a25-82e7-37c5-acdb-c1f27b3a895f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low acknowledges that designing a stylish fitness tracker is difficult. Fitbit has tried it a few times before but their most recent attempt, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Luxe" href="https://bit.ly/3wvT5Sz">Luxe</a>, is indeed chic — but Cherlynn says its size is actually the most impressive thing about it. Measuring 0.4 x 1.43 inches, the Luxe manages to include a heart rate sensor, oxygen saturation monitoring, sleep tracking, water resistance and basic phone syncing all in its tiny frame.</p><p>However, the downside is that small footprint results in a tiny screen as well. The 0.76-inch AMOLED panel, which runs at a 124 x 206 resolution, is hard to read. Cherlynn said that the text showing workout stats, cardio zone information and notifications might be frustratingly small for some. That aside, she had no problem using the Luxe to track workouts and sleep data; it works as promised and the UI is similar to other Fitbit devices without physical buttons. The touchscreen was responsive and she was able to get seven days of battery life — and that was even with connected GPS turned on for a bit. Overall, Cherlynn calls the Luxe well-made and capable, but best for those looking for a petite tracker.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-spend-some-time-with-the-apple-ios-15-beta-160009850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d310d1cb-3620-47c2-8c6b-c5dbe19a3940</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625859876</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T19:44:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An iPhone XR laying on a white surface showing "What's new in iOS 15" on its screen.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 beta ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How NASA selected the first Lunar Rover to scoot across the moon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The concept of space travel was so new to us that when President Kennedy issued his famous moonshot speech, not even NASA&#39;s top scientists were completely sure we could actually land on the lunar surface. Some thought any craft that set down there would simply sink into the moon&#39;s regolith like it was a massive, airless pit of quicksand!

In the excerpt below, Swift takes the reader on a tour of the JPL&#39;s hyper-rigorous, tread-shredding lunar test course and the battle for rover supremacy waged there between GM and Bendix.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b6c6a670-e011-11eb-bed3-f1a5c8f1ce22" alt="Across the Airless Wilds" data-uuid="2f1f31e1-7bf0-3458-8795-77b4d4d05343"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Custom House</div></figure><p><em>From the book </em><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/across-the-airless-wilds-earl-swift">ACROSS THE AIRLESS WILDS: The Lunar Rover and the Triumph of the Final Moon Landings</a><em> by Earl Swift.

Sure enough, come summer, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory laid out its requirements for a hundred-pound, remote-controlled rover that it wanted to stash aboard the landers. The vehicle would explore the lurrain up to a mile from the Surveyors, while its drivers back on Earth steered it with television eyes. The laboratory alerted companies planning to bid on the phase 1 design study—the normal first stage of any new hardware program—that they’d be expected to supply engineering models of their concepts. Proposals were due in seven weeks.</p><p>The short deadline weeded out the dilettantes. In October the two companies left standing—GM and Bendix—started work under contract. GM was ready with its six-wheeled design. Its Surveyor lunar roving vehicle was six feet long on eighteen-inch wheels and weighed ninety pounds—half the size and half again as heavy as its test bed, with a sure-footedness that was no less jaw-dropping. On Pavlics’s “lunarium” of rocks, craters, and slopes outside the Santa Barbara lab, it climbed forty-five-degree inclines, leapt twenty-inch crevasses, and bent its way up and over thirty-inch steps.</p><p>Bekker and Pavlics had been working on the idea for more than three years by then. Their main advancement this time: the wheels. Again, they were made of wire, but it was knotted into a wide mesh that resembled chain-link, and shaped into fat doughnuts. Like the team’s earlier wire tires, they deflected when they hit an obstacle and absorbed some of the bumps of cross-country travel. They worked with or without a fabric covering.</p><p>“We had a big program to try to come up with the wire material that would survive the vacuum environment on the moon,” John Calandro recalled. “Frank had devised a testing device that created the vacuum environment we needed.”</p><p>When fully geared up for a mission, the rover would be an electronic wonder, with subsystems supplied by RCA Astro-Electronics and by AC Electronics, a GM division in Milwaukee: it would have a stereo TV imaging rig, sophisticated navigation and control, and silver-zinc batteries recharged by solar panel. But Santa Barbara’s part of the job, the vehicle itself, was a study in doing more with less. The hardware was constantly “assessed to see if something simpler might be able to do the same job,” designer Norman J. James would remember. “‘The part that’s left off never breaks’ was an often-repeated phrase.”</p><p>Bendix took a radically different approach. Its SLRV was a squarish, two-part, articulated robot, with curving, shock-absorbing legs at its corners that ended in small caterpillar track assemblies. The tracks pitched independently to follow uneven ground. Its handlers steered it with commands to slow, speed up, or reverse the tracks on one side or the other, and the pivot linking the two halves did the rest. On the moon, it would be powered by a radioisotope thermal generator—a small nuclear device—hanging off the back, and bristle with scientific instruments and antennas. It weighed one hundred pounds.</p><p>Side by side with the GM model, the Bendix machine looked bulky and awkward, and those tiny tracks didn’t seem much of a match for Pavlics’s nearly spherical wire wheels. But Bendix was bullish on its design right up to the day in May 1964 when a panel from the U.S. Geological Survey, Caltech, and NASA took the two models to a volcanic field north of Flagstaff, Arizona, and turned them loose on the rugged Bonito Lava Flow. “We had one little section where they could really get into some pretty rough stuff,” the Geological Survey’s Jack McCauley recalled years later. “The GM vehicle was perfect. It got from point A to point B without any mishaps or turning over.</p><p>“The poor Bendix vehicle had tanklike treads that were made of some kind of rubber-type thing,” McCauley said. “The vehicle just started shredding the treads. In fact, when they finished halfway down the course, it had no treads left. So, the GM thing obviously got our blessing.”</p><p>General Motors had scored a decisive victory. Unfortunately, it didn’t add up to a rover on the moon. The “Rover Boys,” as that panel of testers came to be known, were mightily impressed with the six-wheeler, but its capabilities didn’t square with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s requirements: namely, to “go around and take pictures every ten meters, and also to use a penetrometer to see what the strength of the lunar soil was—and to do it in a preordained manner,” McCauley said. “Basically, just do a grid survey.” Bendix had produced too little rover for the mission; GM had produced too much. The Rover Boys reluctantly reported that neither rover matched the Surveyor program’s stated needs, and that was among the reasons that NASA scrubbed the rover component not long after.</p><p>By that time, JPL’s Ranger program had finally given NASA its first close looks at the moon. By design, they were fleeting glimpses: Ranger probes crashed into the lunar surface while taking high-resolution photos right up to the moment of impact. Conceived in 1959, the program had, at times, seemed another exercise in frustration. After Rangers 1 and 2 made two development test voyages in 1961, along came Rangers 3 through 6, all of which were busts. It wasn’t until July 1964, and Ranger 7, that the program literally hit pay dirt. As the spacecraft fell toward the moon, its cameras kicked on, and, for some seventeen minutes, it took and transmitted photographs of the approaching surface—4,316 images in all, some of them at a resolution hundreds of times greater than the best taken from Earth.

If you ask rival company Blue Origin, though, Branson won&#39;t really be reaching space when he does. In a couple of <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001">tweets</a>, the Jeff Bezos-owned space corporation compared what its own New Shepard suborbital vehicle can do with SpaceShipTwo&#39;s capabilities. First in the list? The company says New Shepard was designed to fly above the Kármán line, whereas its competitor&#39;s vehicle was not.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kármán line is the boundary between the Earth&#39;s atmosphere and outer space as set by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale. It&#39;s defined as 100 kilometers or 62 miles above sea level, and according to Blue Origin, it&#39;s what &quot;96 percent of the world&#39;s population&quot; recognizes as the beginning of outer space. Blue Origin plans to offer customers 10 minutes of flight with an altitude that reaches the Kármán line. Meanwhile, Virgin Galactic&#39;s <a href="https://www.virgingalactic.com/">website</a> says its flights will soar at &quot;nearly&quot; 300,000 feet (57 miles) in altitude. That doesn&#39;t quite reach the Kármán line, though that&#39;s still higher than what NASA and the US government defines as the beginning of space (50 miles above sea level).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7bb2074d97154b968af2e3d3804fdc31"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Only 4% of the world recognizes a lower limit of 80 km or 50 miles as the beginning of space. New Shepard flies above both boundaries. One of the many benefits of flying with Blue Origin. <a href="https://t.co/4EAzMfCmYT">pic.twitter.com/4EAzMfCmYT</a></p>— Blue Origin (@blueorigin) <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521631717122059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 9, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Aside from comparing their vehicles&#39; maximum altitudes, Blue Origin also made it a point to mention that the New Shepard has the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-12-blue-origin-tests-crew-capsule-2-0-with-biggest-windows-in-spa.html">largest windows</a> in space. Also, the New Shepard is a rocket, but SpaceShipTwo, according to Blue Origin, is just a high-altitude plane. The company published the comparison after Virgin Galactic scheduled Branson&#39;s trip to space before Jeff Bezos&#39; — the multi-billionaire and his brother will join Blue Origin&#39;s first suborbital tourist flight that&#39;s scheduled for a July 20th launch.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d25a402-7549-4c36-8975-05351ffd512a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 13:33:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625924003</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T13:33:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/75bacb40-e163-11eb-bef3-3526ea447d76" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/75bacb40-e163-11eb-bef3-3526ea447d76" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung makes its free TV Plus streaming service available on the web]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even people who don&#39;t own Samsung devices can now enjoy its ad-supported streaming service. According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"><em>Protocol</em></a>, the tech giant launched TV Plus — something that used to be exclusively available on the the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">brand&#39;s TVs</a> and mobile devices — <a href="https://samsungtvplus.com/">for the web</a> in May.&nbsp;</p><p>It was likely a soft launch, as the publication called it, seeing as Samsung has yet to formally announce its web version and has yet to include it in any marketing material for the streaming service. While there was zero fanfare surrounding TV Plus&#39; web expansion, a company rep confirmed to <em>Protocol</em> that Samsung did indeed roll out a web version of the service in the second quarter.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung launched TV Plus back in 2016, and it has since evolved into its current cable-like free ad-supported form. It&#39;s accessible in 23 countries, and in the US, it gives viewers access to 140 channels that include <em>ABC News Live</em> and <em>Vice</em>. Samsung Electronics SVP Sang Kim told <em>Protocol</em> that the company streams &quot;billions of minutes every month,&quot; so it&#39;s clearly pretty popular with users. Its reach has been limited to Samsung customers up until now, though, and it remains to be seen whether the web version&#39;s availability can add a substantial number of new users to the service.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-plus-streaming-service-web-034944264.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ac589a55-8101-42d1-8cc9-f458bc503c56</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:49:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625888994</ingested><modified>2021-07-10T03:50:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f521e7f0-e12d-11eb-8ff8-c36eb6c1d8f6" width="1500" height="968" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f521e7f0-e12d-11eb-8ff8-c36eb6c1d8f6" width="1500" height="968" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
