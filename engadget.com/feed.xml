Starting today, if you live in the US, you can listen to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-replay-215630367.html"><ins>replays</ins></a> and live rooms with replays enabled using a web browser.

When you’re in a guest room, you can tap the Share button, located at the bottom of the interface, to post a link to a session through Clubhouse, a social network or messaging app. When you pick the first option, you can add a comment to describe the room. If it’s a live room, your followers will get notification so that they can join.</p><p>Notably, both updates see Clubhouse making its app more widely accessible. When the app first launched, you had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html"><ins>obtain an invite to join</ins></a>. But as companies like Facebook and Twitter have moved to add live audio to their platforms, it has been forced to adapt in a bid to stay relevant.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-web-listening-225259317.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9206a639-2bf7-4a92-ac6f-f74edfcba772</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:52:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641509581</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:53:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66170970-e4c8-11eb-ad76-0f40b1ee67c3" width="2823" height="1792" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/66170970-e4c8-11eb-ad76-0f40b1ee67c3" width="2823" height="1792" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Clubhouse app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

The company is testing a new “Tweet Take” feature that allows users to share reaction videos alongside a Quote Tweet.</p><p>With the test, Twitter users can opt to send a “Quote Tweet with reaction” instead of the typical retweet or Quote Tweet. These “Tweet Takes” as the company is calling them can be either a photo or a video, and the original tweet will be embedded as a card overtop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concept is similar to a feature in Twitter’s short-lived Fleets feature, which enabled users to share tweets with their own commentary in a full-screen format. Fleets, of course, never really gained traction and the company pulled the feature less than a month after its launch.</p><div id="1484984092e441aeb4236253898a2b46"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!<br><br>Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. <a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh">pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Fleets, these reaction videos will appear in the main timeline just like any other tweet, though the videos will look noticeably different than the typical retweet. (While users can record a reaction in full-screen, it’s not clear what format they appear in the timeline. We’ve reached out to Twitter for more info.)</p><p>But these “takes” are perhaps even more similar to TikTok-style reaction videos, which often feature a comment or another users’ clip as the source. While Twitter hasn’t necessarily encouraged these types of interaction in the past, the company has been taking steps to build more creator-friendly features so it’s not necessarily surprising to see this kind of experiment.</p><p>Of course, just as Twitter users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fleets-harassment-013757824.html">raised concerns</a> about whether Fleets could be used to target people for harassment, tailored reaction videos also feels like the kind of feature that could be ripe for abuse. Quote Tweets are already a major source of dunking and bullying — which Twitter has at times tried<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-twitter-will-test-auto-emojis-to-stop-you-dunk-tweeting.html"><ins> to discourage</ins></a> —  so it’s not difficult to imagine that these “Tweet Takes” could also become problematic. It’s also not clear just how big the initial experiment will be — Twitter often previews new ideas and features in early stages, but not all make it past the testing phase.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-quote-tweet-reaction-videos-223147548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6833952-748c-42c2-95d9-7ad20efca038</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:31:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641508307</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:31:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is experimenting with reaction videos for Quote Tweets.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter reaction videos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Home Hub is a tablet for controlling SmartThings devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the products Samsung showed off at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-2022-supercut-150856924.html">CES 2022 presentation</a> was the Home Hub, an 8.4-inch tablet for controlling all the connected home devices in your household. The company has now <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-home-hub-helps-manage-chores-from-one-central-device">shared</a> more information about it. At launch, the Home Hub will have the ability to connect to every product in the SmartThings ecosystem, including Samsung appliances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/76f915a0-6f13-11ec-bbfe-69c99639675c" alt="Samsung Home Hub" data-uuid="fe137466-8a06-317c-ba9f-8d902ccf4843"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>In that way, it can tell you how much power your appliances use and if one needs cleaning. Home cooks will find a recipe hub for creating shopping lists and meal plans. Those are just some of the use cases Samsung outlines for the Home Hub. The company says the device’s AI software will anticipate what you need and put that information in front of you exactly when you need it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung has also pledged to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html">Matter standard</a>, which should open the door for the hub to connect to devices from other manufacturers. Based on the photos shared by Samsung, the Home Hub runs Android, suggesting it may also be possible to use it as a standard tablet. The device also comes with two speakers and two microphones, as well as the company’s Bixby assistant. The tablet will come with the charging dock you see pictured in the photos, and you’re free to take it out of that stand.</p><p>At first glance, it’s hard to see the appeal of the Home Hub. After all, it’s essentially a tablet that comes with the company’s SmartThings app preinstalled. You can download that same software on your phone. So it’s not like it’s offering something that isn’t already out there. However, framed another way, it’s a different approach to a smart display. Samsung hasn’t tried to create a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html">Echo Show 15</a> that wants to be the center of your home. The focus here is narrow, and that’s something that could appeal to people.</p><p>Samsung will release the Home Hub in Korea sometime in March, with global availability to follow later. No word yet on US pricing.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-home-hub-ces-2022-221133090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c569a334-73b3-4265-bd5c-6843c0adebc4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:11:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641507095</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:11:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/64ba3770-6f13-11ec-93df-d64df760e33f" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Home Hub]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[E3 will be online-only again this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the third straight year, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/e3/">E3</a>.

In suing the USPTO, Snap hopes to overturn the appeal board’s decision.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snap first filed for a Spectacles trademark in 2016, the same year it released the first-generation model.

VW Group chief Herbert Diess has <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041">announced</a> that his company will debut the reincarnated microbus on March 9th. He didn&#39;t share more beyond a sketch, but VW&#39;s testing of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-buzz-electric-minivan-arrives-as-a-self-driving-prototype-125030104.html">self-driving prototype</a> suggests the finished van won&#39;t lose many of the design cues from the nostalgia-inspired concept.</p><p>The ID.Buzz is expected to launch in Europe later in 2022, and reach American shores in 2023. You&#39;ll have to &#39;settle&#39; for the passenger-focused long-wheelbase model in the US where Europeans will get short-wheelbase and commercial models. Europe is also more likely to get a self-driving variant, too. Entry models could start with rear wheel drive models that offer up to 200HP, while the range-topper could include AWD and 300HP. You may see up to three battery capacities.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Buzz might not be as mass market-friendly as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">the ID.4</a> and other more conventional models, but it could still be one of VW&#39;s most important EVs. Like the Beetle, VW&#39;s microbus design remains iconic. The Buzz could serve as a halo vehicle whose cachet attracts buyers to the brand&#39;s overall EV lineup, even if they ultimately settle for another model.</p><div id="accbe979b16046bda66c89488754fe55"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The legend returns on 03/09/22! <a href="https://t.co/Q4hFyCN5mr">pic.twitter.com/Q4hFyCN5mr</a></p>— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vw-id-buzz-microbus-reveal-date-173402540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dac16427-38a6-41e7-9c24-6577fd351376</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:34:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641489969</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T17:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e202770-6f10-11ec-bfff-c1077ea57e66" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VW ID.Buzz EV production reveal teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The New York Times is reportedly buying subscription-based sports site The Athletic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-the-athletic-sports-news-subscription-podcasts.html"><em><ins>The Athletic</ins></em></a>, which quickly came to prominence for publishing <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/nwsl-uswnt-players-call-for-investigation-after-coach-paul-riley-accused-of-sexual-coercion-171549998.html"><ins>exclusive reporting</ins></a> and high-quality sports journalism, is getting a new owner.

All of Bowie&#39;s post-2000 studio albums (<em>Heathen</em>, <em>Reality</em>, <em>The Next Day</em> and <em>Blackstar</em>) plus a live album (<em>A Reality Tour</em>) have been remixed in Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">360 Reality Audio</a> for release on Amazon Music Unlimited, Deezer and Tidal on January 21st.

The company has packed more features into the product, such as the ability to monitor body temperature. The graphite-infused foam mattress can cool or heat each side of the bed to maintain each person&#39;s preferred temperature throughout the night. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-sleep-number-climate360.html"><ins>Climate360 mattress</ins></a> also has such a feature. The smart bed can warm your feet to help you drift off too.</p><p>As with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-03-sleep-number-360-smart-bed-auto-adjustments.html"><ins>the current model</ins></a>, there&#39;s a snoring detection function. That can prompt the bed to raise your head to mitigate moderate snoring. In addition, the bed can tilt entirely to open your airway and help you breathe more easily while keeping your spine properly aligned.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the core ideas behind the latest model is that it&#39;s designed to adapt to your changing needs. For instance, it can be raised or lowered to help those who are pregnant, have an injury or are simply getting a little older to get in and out of bed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4cc923e0-6f06-11ec-adfd-98d4c1c22219" style="height:656;width:1021;" alt="A graphic showing a SleepIQ score as measured by Sleep Number 360 smart bed.

Eventually, it may be able to monitor for signs of insomnia, sleep apnea or cardiac events and alert the sleeper about possible conditions. Software updates should add more features and insights over time.</p><p>The revamped 360 smart bed will be available in 2023. Pricing is expected to start at $1,099.</p><p>Sleep Number also announced some smart furniture that&#39;s designed to complement the bed. Features include mobility aids, individual noise reduction tech, ambient lighting and a built-in charging and storage pocket. The company will start shipping the furniture next year too.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sleep-number-latest-smart-bed-body-temperature-health-conditions-162007609.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f92da8-9676-48d7-98cf-5decc4813d81</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:20:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641484156</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T15:49:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/45d274b0-6f06-11ec-bbbf-639a8e3f24d7" width="985" height="642" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/45d274b0-6f06-11ec-bbbf-639a8e3f24d7" width="985" height="642" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sleep Number]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sleep Number 360 smart bed]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sleep Number 360 smart bed]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify will show clickable in-app ads when they're mentioned on a podcast]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, Spotify revealed that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-podcasts-in-app-offers-120000774.html">testing an ad setup</a> that would make promo codes and special URLs during podcast ads a thing of the past. Starting today, those in-app advertisements are starting to roll out. The company says its call-to-action (CTA) cards <a href="https://www.newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-06/spotify-introduces-call-to-action-cards-for-podcast-ads">will begin showing up</a> on its original and exclusive shows when the corresponding ad or offer is mentioned during an episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The new CTA cards will show up in the Spotify app as soon as the ad plays during a podcast on the player interface as well as on the show and episode pages. If you leave any of those places to do something else — like stream music, for example — the ads will display when you return back to that podcast in those three locations. Essentially, Spotify sees this as a way to not only relieve you have having to remember a promo code or specific URL, but it also argues you&#39;ll be able to interact with ads or brands you&#39;re interested in when you have the time to do so. There&#39;s no doubt a simple tap, if you&#39;re interested in what you&#39;ve just heard, is much more convenient than manually typing in the usual info. Of course, the downside is you&#39;ll now see ads in the app when listening to certain podcasts — even if you&#39;re a paid subscriber.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify doesn&#39;t see this as a potential issue, since even paid users hear ads on podcasts when listening to shows through its app. The advertisements keep podcasts afloat after all, and have turned the medium into a lucrative tool for businesses to promote goods and services. However, some might argue seeing an ad in the app and listening to one during a show are two very different things. Brands will probably be willing to jump on board quickly though since Spotify says the clickable ads have generated twice as many site visits during the early adoption phase than the &quot;traditional&quot; ad reads for companies like Ulta Beauty, Athletic Greens and Squarespace.</p><p>The CTA cards are powered by Spotify&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-spotify-podcast-ad-stats-sai.html">Streaming Ad Insertion</a>, a powerful analytics platform for podcast ads that automatically slots in pre-recorded promotional reads in the ideal spot for each listener. This is how the app knows when to begin showing the corresponding card for the ad when you hear it during a show. Of course, Spotify is promoting the CTA method as the first &quot;interactive&quot; podcast ads, and there&#39;s no doubt brands will be excited to have a more visible and, most importantly, clickable way to reach audiences. But it will be interesting to see how listeners respond to visual ads in their streaming app, especially those who pay a monthly premium so they don&#39;t have to hear them on non-podcast content.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-call-to-action-cards-podcast-ads-160009589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a365edf5-7824-4532-b16c-e22442e72a18</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641479552</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T14:32:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max are just $400 at Woot for Amazon Prime members]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a> might finally be within reach if you were waiting for them to reach a price threshhold.

When we last left the young crew of the <em>USS Protostar</em>, they had just left the Murder Planet and successfully fled the Diviner’s ship thanks to the activation of the ship’s secret experimental engine. Episode six, Kobayashi, picks up this thread, pushing the story… and possibly the timeline forward in some significant ways this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The title is a dead giveaway to one of the threads running through the episode, at least: “Kobayashi” is the name of the ship from the infamous “Kobayashi Maru” test (“Maru” means ship in Japanese). It’s basically a no-win scenario that cadets at Starfleet Academy are run through to test their readiness for command, except this time it’s self-proclaimed captain Dal in the big chair via a holodeck simulation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b25a2be0-6e6c-11ec-81ff-cea94c5ca9ba" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Brett Gray as Dal in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

As with Janeway, the show being animated keeps the older characters from having that creepy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-20-star-wars-rogue-one-cgi-actor.html"><em>Rogue One Princess Leia look</em></a>, but the audio samples could have used a lot more processing to have them match up.

Janeway has the files, except they’re classified and it’s up to Gwyn and Zero to try to open them up. And, though the initial reveal from them is a bit of a shocker (to be delved into next week), it’s the flashback sequence early in the episode that yielded the juiciest info for now.</p><p>We’re shown the Diviner 17 years earlier, in horrible health and already looking for the <em>USS Protostar</em>. He decides to create a “progeny,” in the hopes of continuing his race, even though it is against the rules. (Whose rules? That’s another unanswered question.) But the interesting reveal here is that the Diviner was already looking for the Protostar 17 years ago, suggesting that this series may not occupy the 2383 time frame we were given in press materials (though never mentioned on-screen).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe886e00-6e6c-11ec-baa3-fe2810ba79e3" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk, Brett Gray as Dal, Ella Purnell as Gwyn Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Even assuming the <em>Protostar</em> is built and launched in a year (which I doubt), <em>Prodigy</em> can’t take place any earlier than 2396, placing it firmly around the time of <em>Picard</em>, which is set in 2399. It’s possible that <em>Prodigy</em> is actually a few years later, however, making it the first Star Trek series set in the 25th century. Or the <em>Protostar</em> traveled through time, complicating things even further.</p><p>But assuming the time period is, in fact, the 25th century, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen the future of the Federation or Starfleet: <em>Discovery</em> is now set in the 32nd century, after all. But being much closer to the time period of earlier shows like <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and, of course, <em>Voyager</em> makes <em>Prodigy</em> more of a direct continuation of that era. The inclusion of Janeway as a training hologram already gave us a peek as the vaunted status the <em>Voyager </em>crew holds after their Delta Quadrant sojourn, but now the advanced tech seen in episode three “Starstruck” suddenly makes a lot more sense knowing it might be a few years… or decades since <em>Voyager</em>.</p><div id="aa466e8ad1ff497aa1446c179ed31d28"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8316X_cGYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>With the exception of <em>Picard</em>, the live-action shows have largely stayed away from the immediate future of the <em>TNG-DS9-Voyager</em> era, choosing instead to retread the 23rd century or even jump forward nearly a thousand years. It’s certainly odd given the popularity of those shows, but in leaving it be Paramount+ has left a lot of room for <em>Prodigy</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> to do something interesting there, experimenting with new genres while still appeasing hard-core fans. This may be the future we’ve been waiting to see on Star Trek.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-episode-six-140026030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc8d4063-e3f1-4fe2-9ef4-513873d1d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419343</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T21:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Angus Imrie as Zero, Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ Â©2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

We gave the tablet a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html">score of 90</a> when it first came out thanks in part to its speedy performance, healthy battery life and fun colors. Normally $599, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad Air" href="https://amzn.to/3EU8zny">iPad Air</a> is back on sale at Amazon right now for $539, or $60 off its normal price. Only the silver model has been discounted at the time of writing this, but if you don&#39;t mind skipping out on one of the more unique color options, this sale price is one of the best we&#39;ve seen in months.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EU8zny" id="a4e26322f5fe4f06999781254c0eea77" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy iPad Air at Amazon - $539</a><p>The Air sits in between the 10.2-inch iPad and the iPad Pros as Apple&#39;s mid-tier option. It runs on an A14 Bionic chipset with a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU, and this particular model on sale has 64GB of storage and WiFi 6 capabilities. Apple refreshed the tablet&#39;s design to make it look more like the Pros, complete with flat edges, a USB-C port for charging and a lovely 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display. You won&#39;t get FaceID on this machine, but you will get TouchID thanks to the fingerprint reader on the device&#39;s power button.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Overall, we found the Air to be zippy both in performance and WiFi speeds, and its battery lasted up to 12.5 hours in our testing. While the latest iPad Pros are better if you&#39;re looking for a laptop replacement, you could use the Air as a 2-in-1 while on the go thanks to its compatibility with Apple&#39;s Magic Keyboard. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, allowing it to be a digital notebook for those that prefer writing things out by hand.</p><p>A discount like this is a good one to consider if you want an all-purpose tablet that&#39;s one step up from the base iPad. However, there are a few noteworthy discounts on the 10.2-inch tablet right now, too. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB WiFi model" href="https://amzn.to/337rfCU">256GB WiFi model</a> is $30 off and down to $449, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB, WiFi + Cellular model" href="https://amzn.to/3qUXnCc">256GB, WiFi + Cellular model</a> has hit a record low fo $580.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-ipad-air-is-back-on-sale-for-539-135156953.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7d91363-8939-4982-a91f-fa0deece2709</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 13:51:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641477117</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T13:52:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/06a1fea0-6ef7-11ec-8bdf-626f13d2ef87" width="1800" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/06a1fea0-6ef7-11ec-8bdf-626f13d2ef87" width="1800" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple&#39;s iPad Air is back on sale for $539]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: ASUS made a 17-inch foldable OLED tablet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-3-dual-screen-laptop-hands-on-price-specs-availability-160028888.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Dual-screens</a>, foldable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-17-fold-oled-tablet-foldable-164510240.html">OLED tablets</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-55-inch-odyssey-ark-portrait-display-082359410.html https://www.engadget.com/...">curved vertical screens</a> and more.

Its original developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-15-torrent-front-end-popcorn-time-made-streaming-movies-free-and-ea.html">took the service down</a> and abandoned the project merely a few days after it launched in 2014. But since the project was open source, other developers were able pick up where they left off, and it&#39;s been killed and revived a few more times ever since. It remains to be seen whether Popcorn Time is now gone for good, but it looks like the biggest contributor to its most recent demise is the dwindling interest in the app.</p><p>On its website, the developers posted a graph of &quot;popcorn time&quot; searches over the past seven years. While   the app enjoyed a ton of searches in the months after its launch in 2015, the graph shows a sharp decline in interest by 2016. Its popularity continued to wane, and it never really recovered after that, at least based on Google Trends.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/popcorn-time-alternative-is-hard-to-find-as-app-shuts-down?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the group behind Popcorn Time announced its closure in an email. While they didn&#39;t say whether law enforcement action was a factor behind their decision to shut down the app this time around, Popcorn Time has had brushes with the law in the past. The original version may have closed after authorities got involved, and Hollywood studios even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-popcorn-time-hollywood-lawsuit.html">sued individual users</a> who allegedly downloaded and shared copies of movies illegally.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers associated with Popcorn Time previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-20-popcorn-time-p2p.html">talked about</a> how they&#39;re not responsible for piracy themselves, because the service doesn&#39;t actually host any content. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer sharing system and only provided a way for users to access content hosted on other people&#39;s computers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/movie-piracy-app-popcorn-time-shuts-down-115523694.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d05730b2-9427-4eac-99fd-d6d4cdb2cc4c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:55:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641467549</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T11:12:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[French regulator fines Google and Facebook a combined $238 million over cookies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>France&#39;s data regulator CNIL has <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">fined Google</a> €150 million ($170 million) and Meta/Facebook €60 million ($68 million) for violating EU privacy rules.

Now, Nike has filed a lawsuit against the company over Mirror, accusing it of patent infringement. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-at-home-mirror-gym-and-fitness-apps.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-mirror-fitness-technology-11641429626"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Nike&#39;s lawsuit allege that Mirror — a full-size interactive mirror that brings a live fitness instructor into the user&#39;s home — and its apps use technologies that it invented and patented.&nbsp;</p><p>The sports apparel giant specifically mentioned that it filed a patent application in 1983 for a device that can prompt users to exercise, monitor their heart rate, determine their speed while running and the calories they burned. Nike also has a number of mobile apps for fitness, including the Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nike sent Lululemon a list of patents it allegedly infringed on back on November 3rd. As you&#39;d expect, the company more known for making yoga pants and other types of gym clothes disagreed with Nike&#39;s assessment. A spokesperson told the publications in a statement that the patents &quot;in question are overly broad and invalid.&quot; They also said that Lululemon is confident in its position and &quot;look forward to defending it in court.&quot;</p><p>Mirror operates as a standalone company within Lululemon, putting the workout clothes-maker in direct competition with the likes of Peloton and Tonal. Lululemon CEO Clavin McDonald previously <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-ceo-explains-why-it-bought-mirror-170336105.html">said</a> that the purchase was all about connecting with consumers, because they&#39;re bound to spend more the more they engage with the brand. Last month, however, the company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lululemon-slashes-sales-estimate-for-its-mirror-brand-growth-slows-2021-12">halved</a> its sales forecast for the device, calling 2021 &quot;a challenging year for digital fitness.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the only patent-related legal battle Lululemon is embroiled in. Last year, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/business/lululemon-peloton-lawsuit.html">filed</a> a patent infringement lawsuit of its own against Peloton, alleging that the design the other company used for a new line of leggings and sports bras infringe on its intellectual property.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nike-sues-lululemon-over-mirror-home-gym-081555042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47c94904-62ec-4217-af21-7f03767caff7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 08:15:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641456956</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T08:16:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lululemon/Mirror]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Facebook moderators can work from home following protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta&#39;s in-house staff won&#39;t have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-allows-return-to-office-deferrals-141013788.html">return to the office for months</a>, but some of its contracted workers are only now getting a similar reprieve. <em>BuzzFeed News</em> has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/facebook-moderators-who-were-ordered-back-to-the-office-can">learned</a> subcontractor Accenture has scrapped a requirement that hundreds of Facebook moderators return to in-person work in Mountain View, California on January 24th.

The moderators said it was impossible to maintain Accenture&#39;s social distancing requirements given tightly packed offices, closed stairwells, and poor enforcement, and that the company didn&#39;t provide exemptions for immunocompromised workers or vulnerable family members.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An Accenture spokesperson confirmed that moderators working from home &quot;should continue to do so&quot; based on COVID-19 health data, and claimed the company worked &quot;collaboratively&quot; to accommodate individuals in compliance with the law. Meta, meanwhile, said it would &quot;continue to prioritize&quot; the health and safety of all workers. Meta&#39;s own employees can defer returns to the office to as late as June.</p><p>These concerns aren&#39;t strictly new. Moderators accused Meta (then Facebook) in 2020 of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-coronavirus-protections-202420431.html">putting lives at risk</a> by asking some contractors to work from the office even when family members were highly vulnerable. Meta disputed some of the claims at the time, but not all. This also comes after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-lawsuit-settlement-212601146.html">$52 million settlement</a> with moderators who said they developed PTSD and other mental health issues while screening harmful material.

The tech is different from your standard OLED in that it only uses blue organic light-emitting diodes. Those diodes then shine the light they produce through a series of quantum dots, allowing the panel to produce the full spectrum of color visible to the human eye.&nbsp;</p><p>The approach has multiple advantages. The most notable, particularly compared to current OLED displays, is that the panel can get a lot brighter. In a demo <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1641348163"><em>FlatspanelsHD</em></a> saw at CES, one display produced more than 1,000 nits of peak brightness across a 10 percent window. For comparison, some of the more recent TVs from LG can produce between 700 nits and 1,000 nits of brightness across the same area. Brightness is something LG has consistently tried to address with its WOLD panels. In December, the company’s display subsidiary unveiled its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html">OLED EX</a>” tech, claiming it would enhance brightness by up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another advantage of the technology is better color performance. The panels Samsung Display showed off at CES 2022 covered 90 percent of the Rec. 2020 color gamut. LG’s WOLED panels, which people consistently praise for their accurate and vibrant colors, hit about 70 percent of the Rec. 2020 standard. Lastly, viewing angles are improved, so you won&#39;t lose colors when when you&#39;re viewing QD-OLED screens from extreme angles. In addition to TVs, the technology will make its way to gaming monitors, with Samsung and Dell planning to use the tech in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-quantum-dot-oled-gaming-monitor-160035802.html">34-inch displays</a>.</p><p>We’ll have to see how the panels perform in the real world. But on paper, QD-OLED could easily become the new standard for high-end consumer TVs. One of the first companies set to release a TV with a QD-OLED panel is Sony with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html">A95K</a> sets. Unfortunately, Sony has yet to announce how much those TVs will cost, and we won’t know until closer to release sometime this spring.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d29de600-da31-496c-9f46-7d7b40360258</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:50:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641507217</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:13:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch GM's Silverado EV reveal in 10 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="629f9bd2c57c4315a786deb0b6c210b9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNZR1ckXLlk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>GM had a lot to show off during its virtual CES 2022 keynote, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, which is built on the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery platform</a>.
