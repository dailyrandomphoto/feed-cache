The latest series is dubbed ROG Phone 5 (skipping the &quot;4&quot; due to tetraphobia; you obviously don&#39;t want to associate gaming with death), and while it may appear to merely don some minor cosmetic changes, the innards have been completely revamped for better heat dissipation, weight distribution and audio performance. As a bonus, there&#39;s also a Pro model plus a limited edition ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, with the latter boasting a whopping 18GB of RAM.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5cbdb8c8-a208-4c23-a783-942e56d8bd66"/><p>Let&#39;s get the basics out of the way first. In addition to the processor, all three models share the same 6.78-inch Samsung E4 AMOLED display, which packs the same 144Hz refresh rate as before (so Nubia wins this round with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">165Hz</a>), but with a slightly taller 2,448 x 1,080 resolution and a slightly faster 300Hz touch sampling rate — giving you an edge over other gamers in terms of responsiveness and accuracy. For those who are wondering, ASUS says there are now <a href="https://zentalk.asus.com/en/discussion/36042/rog-phone-3-list-of-games-supporting-above-60-fps-gameplay" target="_self">over 200 games</a> that support 144Hz refresh rate, with titles including <em>Rockman X Dive</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Shadowgun Legends</em> and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS claims this panel is also 23 percent brighter (up to 800 nits across the entire panel), while pushing the dimmest setting to 5 nits with minimal distortion — the latter making a notable difference in the dark areas in videos. It&#39;s also rated with a wide 111-percent DCI-P3 gamut, 150.89-percent sRGB gamut, Delta-E of &lt;1 accuracy and HDR10+ support. And yes, there&#39;s still an optical in-display fingerprint reader here.</p><p>As much as I enjoy the display improvements, it wasn&#39;t until I started a game of <em>PUBG</em> that I noticed this screen has rounder corners than before, which cut off some info and buttons. Luckily, I could go into the game&#39;s graphics settings and tweak the &quot;non-standard screens&quot; parameter, but this may become a problem for other titles that lack such option.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b0-8190-11eb-9ffd-3ecb282bec63" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="758531ad-4105-3d5c-a453-8e3a9e3c526b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another less obvious but notable upgrade applied to the ROG Phone 5 is the ultrasonic shoulder trigger feature. The new AirTrigger 5 buttons pack more sensors (nine instead of seven) into the same space for improved sensitivity and accuracy, and they are now placed closer to the edges to accommodate smaller hands. Like before, each AirTrigger support swipe gestures, slide gestures (both horizontal and vertical), continuous trigger (long press to simulate multiple clicks) and dual partitioning, giving you a wide range of customizable options. Though personally, I find that the good old default mode is already sufficient for my first-person shooters.</p><p>While most smartphones feature an L-shaped logic board with the processor placed near the top, ASUS found a way to place the Snapdragon 888 right in the middle of the ROG Phone 5 — far away from both hands when in landscape mode. This is mainly thanks to MMT (Middle Middle Tab) battery technology which features a higher energy density, thus allowing for a split cell design without sacrificing the generous 6,000mAh total battery capacity. As a bonus, the two cells also offer better weight distribution and thermal control — up to 7 degrees Celsius lower battery temperature when using 30W charging, and up to 3 degrees Celsius lower when using 65W (as bundled with the ROG Phone 5), according to ASUS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278290-8190-11eb-9feb-1059fbbb859a" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="f6794b74-f611-3290-9391-c9df87690fd5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>This new internal layout, along with the taller body, thinner display panel, new side-mounted port and lack of an external 5G modem (thanks to the Snapdragon 888), allowed ASUS to squeeze extra space into the ROG Phone 5&#39;s front-facing stereo speakers. These have the same 1.2cc chamber space each, thus allowing for a symmetrical audio performance as well as improved richness (the ROG Phone 3 actually had a smaller speaker chamber on one side). On top of that, the new Cirrus Logic CS35L45 mono amp driving each 7-magnet 12x16mm speaker is apparently 21-percent more powerful than before. (It&#39;s also worth noting that the ROG Phone 5 still has quad-mic noise cancellation.)</p><p>Hardware alone doesn&#39;t complete the puzzle, though. Following the impressive results on the ROG Phone 3, ASUS continued its partnership with Dirac for audio tuning on the ROG Phone 5. The Swedish audio specialist has since come up with a dedicated solution for smartphones, which apparently resulted in more accurate calibrations for dampening distortion, enhancing the perceived bass, widening the soundstage and more on this new gaming phone. ASUS even tapped into Dirac&#39;s MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output) technologies — previously reserved for luxury cars only — to co-optimize both speakers as one system for a better overall acoustical response.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278291-8190-11eb-bbdd-100eb11ddfb6" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 3 vs ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="591cc7de-aa8f-3c4a-bdb7-48234c46e9e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>In a quick comparison with the ROG Phone 3 and the ROG Phone 5, the audio improvement was noticeable. In the rainy Tokyo scene where Natasha found Hawkeye in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, everything sounded shallower on the older phone, with the tinny rainfall noise dominating the dialog and music. The ROG Phone 5, on the other hand, sounded louder, richer and deeper. The difference was rather surprising, given how impressed I already was with the ROG Phone 3. Then I realized I could enable a &quot;cinema&quot; option in the AudioWizard&#39;s new &quot;scenario effect&quot; setting, which further boosted the perceived bass.</p><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t forgotten headphone users who still prefer the good old 3.5mm jack. The ROG Phone 5 has gained an ESS Sabre ES9280AC Pro Quad DAC, which can apparently deliver a &quot;best-in-class&quot; signal-to-noise ratio of 130 dB, and can also drive headphones with slightly higher impedance (over 50 ohm) using 2Vrms output. This should pair well with the newly released ROG Cetra II Core earbuds, which offer a seemingly impressive 20Hz-40kHz range. But if you want a wireless option, ASUS is also releasing the ROG Strix Go BT II today, which offers up to 45 hours of battery life along with AI noise cancellation.</p><p>On the photography side, you&#39;ll also find the same set of cameras across the ROG Phone 5 series. In fact, the four shooters are identical to the ones on the ROG Phone 3. The rear trio include a 64MP f/1.8 main camera (Sony IMX686 sensor), a 13MP f/2.4 125-degree ultra-wide camera and a 5MP f/2.0 macro camera, whereas the front side feature a 24MP f/2.45 selfie cam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb465530-8190-11eb-b97b-6ad487fee250" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="a6b90d66-1b63-3556-b5c1-9117de94e449"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Things get a little more interesting with the ROG Phone 5 Pro and limited ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is the small &quot;ROG Vision&quot; PMOLED color screen on the rear side, which lets you display customizable graphics for incoming calls, charging, gaming and other scenarios. With the Ultimate edition, ASUS picked a bold move by equipping it with a monochrome rear screen to go with its matte white finish. Furthermore, both models offer two additional capacitive touch areas on the rear panel, in case you still need more mappable buttons for your hardcore gaming.</p><p>Speaking of, it&#39;s worth pointing out that the updated Game Genie app here offers an &quot;Esports Mode,&quot; which enables &quot;do not disturb&quot; but disables all key mapping, macros, quick controls and more (so no AirTriggers and no rear touch panels). This may come in handy for tournament organizers who want more control over a fair game. Game Genie also now offers audio haptics to select games (namely <em>PUBG</em>), which automatically maps specific sounds like, say, shooting, to haptic feedback, and different weapons provide different feel to make the game more immersive. But again, Esports Mode disables audio haptics.</p><p>Much like the Nubia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">Red Magic 6 Pro</a> &quot;Dao&quot; edition, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate even offers a generous 18GB of LPDDR5 RAM (supplied by SK Hynix), though it shares the same 512GB UFS 3.1 storage as the 5 Pro, which packs 16GB of RAM. The Ultimate edition will also come with a gift box containing a baseball cap, a towel, a deck of playing cards, badges, stickers, mask cover and more.</p><p>ASUS rarely failed us when it came to the range of accessories for the ROG Phone series, but with the ROG Phone 5, it finally decided to retire the dual-screen TwinView Dock and Mobile Desktop Dock. ASUS admitted that these two devices were simply too pricey, which was probably a hint at weak adoption.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b4-8190-11eb-9b7f-e6c43d247ae2" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="fd31d2cd-c1db-37f2-b6d2-43e72d2229ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the other hand, ASUS made a new AeroActive Cooler 5 which now blows directly at the hot spot, thanks to the repositioning of the processor. The company claims that this clip-on fan, with assistance from the vapor cooling chamber and graphite sheets on the inside, delivers up to 10 degrees Celsius lower CPU temperature, as well as up to 15 degrees Celsius lower surface temperature. On top of that, not only does this attachment still double as a kickstand, it adds two physical buttons as well. In other words, this means with the AeroActive Cooler 5, you get a total of four mappable buttons on the rear side of the Pro and Ultimate editions. Alas, if you&#39;re getting the regular ROG Phone 5, you&#39;ll have to buy this fan separately.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb2f4ac0-8190-11eb-babe-fc38cc24f7e1" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="8795f407-29a1-3248-a3d6-639898dcb665"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The ROG Phone 5 series also supports the Switch-like Kunai 3 Gamepad, so long as you have the updated version which comes with a bumper that fits the slightly longer body. Other optional accessories include the ROG Gaming Clip for attaching console controllers (for Xbox, PlayStation and Stadia), the new ROG Lighting Armor Case 3 (which utilizes the pogo pins on the redesigned side-mounted port) and the ASUS Professional Dock (for HDMI and USB expansion).</p><p>It appears that ASUS has once again delivered a well-thought-out package for mobile gamers, thanks to its engineering focus on audio performance, buttons, and cooling, with the Pro and Ultimate editions&#39; ROG Vision screen serving as the cherry on the cake. We&#39;re waiting for confirmation on a US launch for the ROG Phone 5 series, but for now, we do know that the regular version is launching this month, ranging from 799 euros (8GB RAM and 128GB storage) to 999 euros (16GB+256GB) in Europe. The Pro edition will launch in April for 1,199 euros (16GB RAM+512GB), followed by the Ultimate edition in May with a 1,299 euros price tag (18GB+512GB).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4862f7b-db59-40f8-93e6-f18523a268b0</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:23:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615375743</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T11:29:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Richard Lai/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram Lite reboot squeezes the app into a 2MB package]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is today relaunching Instagram Lite, a stripped-down version of the image-sharing app designed for users in emerging markets. Developed by Facebook’s team in Tel Aviv, the birthplace of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-08-facebook-lite-app-update.html" target="_self">Facebook Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-28-facebooks-messenger-lite-expands-to-132-more-countries.html" target="_self">Messenger Lite</a>, the app’s package size is just 2MB. The team said that the focus, like with the other launches, was on users whose smartphones lack storage capacity, processing power and reliable data. In order to reach that size, the app focuses on images, video and messaging, ditching other features and flourishes that fade into the background on the full-fat version of the app.</p><p>Instagram Lite still has the main feed, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-instagram-camera.html" target="_self">Stories</a> — the ephemeral messaging feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-instagram-added-snapchat-features-at-zuckerberg-request.html" target="_self">cribbed</a> from Snapchat — but not IG Live or Shopping. Engineering manager Gal Zellermayer said that, as well as live filters and other AR effects that wouldn’t work on low-power devices, animations have been edited down. He cited the example of the cube animation seen when swiping between different users’ Stories, a very processor and data-intensive transition that didn’t work well on older devices, which has been removed. Zellermayer added that a lot of extra compression work is handled on the server side to relieve the burden off the device itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Michelle Lourie, product manager, explained that there were a number of additional UI tweaks to better suit “new digital users.” This included ditching a trash can to represent a delete icon, in favor of an X, which testers found made more sense. In addition, Lourie said that GIFs and Stickers remain part of the app since, unlike AR filters, they were space efficient while remaining fun. Lourie added that the team is currently working on Dark Mode, a feature that users were requesting long before the app was released.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-28-instagram-lite-google-play.html" target="_self">first version of Instagram Lite</a> was little more than a wrapper around a web app. Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-lite-removed-ahead-of-redesign-013230379.html" target="_self">shut it down that version in May 2020</a>, and at the time said that it was working on a new version with better on-device support. This new edition has been in testing in several territories already, but is today rolling out to Google Play in 170 countries around the world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-lite-2021-relaunch-110016873.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55a31047-f2fb-4c75-8f1a-0f03daf56a7c</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615290632</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T11:50:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e8977ad0-80cb-11eb-bfff-c884b4eb02ce" width="3242" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e8977ad0-80cb-11eb-bfff-c884b4eb02ce" width="3242" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook / Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Screenshot, provided by Facebook, of Instagram Lite (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Lite (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple to invest over $1 billion in new Munich silicon facility]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is pouring over €1 billion ($1.2 billion) into a huge R&amp;D project in Munich, Germany, at the heart of which is a new European Silicon Design Center.

Apple says the building in Munich&#39;s city center will run on 100 percent renewable energy, like its other global offices.

It’s a follow-up of sorts to the Move, the company’s first portable speaker which debuted in 2019. That speaker may have Bluetooth and a battery, but its relatively large size and heavy weight meant it wasn’t exactly a grab-and-go device. The Roam, on the other hand, is made with portability first in mind, putting it in competition with speakers like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3rJ4Of3" target="_self">UE Boom 3</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbx2ko" target="_self">JBL Flip 5</a>.</p><p>My first impression of the Roam is that it’s a portable speaker first that can also be used at home. The Move, on the other hand, is a larger speaker built for the home that you can also take with you. It’s a subtle but important difference in how the Roam was conceived. <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html" target="_self">The $169 Roam</a> is a full-fledged Sonos device, which means when you’re home and connected to WiFi, it works just like any other Sonos speaker. You can group it with other Sonos devices; stream audio from dozens of services; take two Roams and pair them in stereo; use Google Assistant or Alexa for voice control; and stream from Apple devices using AirPlay 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8325e120-80f6-11eb-86bf-36e3e363721f" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="218e7d04-1210-3600-b2bc-a98c1202f5d0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>But like the Move, the Roam also has Bluetooth on board, which means you can pair a device and stream music to it when you’re away from a WiFi network. Its built-in battery is rated for 10 hours of playback, and it automatically goes into a low-power sleep mode when it’s not in use. It should last about 10 days in sleep mode.</p><p>Obviously, being able to link the Roam into a system of Sonos products is a plus for people already in the Sonos ecosystem, but it also has a lot of clever features that further separate it from other portables. For example, the Roam can automatically switch between Bluetooth and WiFi. Once you’ve paired it with your phone, it’ll remember that pairing and be set to go when you take it out of the home. Likewise, when you return it’ll rejoin your WiFi network without prompting. This is an improvement over the Move, which required manual switching between Bluetooth and WiFi.</p><section data-eng-breakout="beae9b3d00af40d498cae1071b28bfe2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/9d6c1b30-80f6-11eb-b9fb-a0ddd48d59e4" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="0839bc68-ac90-36fa-98cb-63f356b61730"></section><p>This speaks to the philosophy Sonos has for the Roam, which is making it simple to use both at and away from home. The Bluetooth-only speaker market is already pretty crowded,” Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, the company’s senior VP of hardware development,” said in an interview ahead of the company’s launch event. “For us, going into this specific market, we had to do more than just put Bluetooth and great sound into these products. We thought really hard about how to bring the Sonos experience from in the home to outside the home.”</p><p>That’s the inspiration behind things like the new “Sound Swap” feature. If you’re playing music on the Roam and want to bounce it to another Sonos speaker, pressing and holding the play button will search for the nearest speaker and send the music to it. The idea is to keep the music flowing from away from home into the home.</p><p>Sound Swap makes use of some intriguing technology. “Pressing and holding play/pause signals the other players to emit an ultra high frequency sound that only Roam can hear,&quot; Hadley Simmons, a product marketing manager at Sonos, explained to Engadget. “Roam can pick up those chirps with its microphones and detect the nearest speaker. It’s basically an easier way to move music throughout your home without having to go back to the Sonos app and sort through your different rooms.” In the same vein, if the Roam is playing music via Bluetooth, you can hold the play button and it’ll automatically stream that music to other Sonos speakers — effectively turning the Roam into a Bluetooth line-in to the rest of your system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/1538bf10-80f7-11eb-affd-772df6bfe86e" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="b64e72bb-d8a1-38da-b2b0-15fcc2f96dea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The technology for Sound Swap came out of the Sonos advanced technology group, a team that came together in the last few years. “In the past, we’d try and innovate in the product development process, but that’s the worst place to try and do it when you have a specific schedule and deadlines in front of you,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “So I created a special, standalone group that works on things for two, three, four years down the road.”</p><p>All these features are meaningless if people don’t want to take the Roam with them, which means its physical design is probably more important here than with standard home speakers. Based on what we’ve seen so far, the Roam looks compact and easy to move. It weighs less than a pound, and Sonos described it as about the same size as a water bottle. The idea is for it to be small and light enough that you don’t need to think about taking it with you; it just becomes a habit. I haven’t used it yet, but I could definitely imagine it being the kind of thing I’d toss in a bag when I leave the house, whether for a quick trip or a cross-country flight (when that’s doable, anyway).</p><p>As usual, there are some smart Sonos flourishes here. The speaker can be used in vertical or horizontal orientation. It detects which way it’s positioned and adjusts the sound accordingly. It’s compatible with all Qi wireless chargers, or you can simply use the included USB-C cable. Sonos is making its own magnetic wireless charger, but unfortunately it’s a $50 extra rather than something included in the box.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cfbb4980-80f6-11eb-bff9-ab189a68b42d" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="d4c92a9a-b41e-32e4-8354-dff56cdf7ee3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The Roam is also rated IP67 for dust and water resistance. In fact, it can be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and still work. The Move has superior resistance to temperature fluctuations, but it can’t be dunked in water. Given other companies have speakers that can even float in a pool, the fact that the Roam can survive a trip underwater is crucial.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Roam needs to sound good — no small feat, given its diminutive size. I haven’t listened to it, but. Simmons said users should expect sound quality comparable to the larger Sonos One speaker, albeit without the same max volume. But the bass presence is said to be much larger than you’d expect out of a speaker that small. Of course, we’ll need to wait to hear it for ourselves, but given what companies like Amazon, Google and Apple have done with their own relatively small speakers, I’m hopefully Sonos has worked its magic on the tiny Roam.</p><p>As usual for Sonos, the Roam features a number of custom internal components, like the so-called “racetrack” mid-woofer. Since a traditional circular design wouldn’t work in the slim, tall Roam, Sonos went with this oval shape to maximize its size. It also has a dedicated tweeter and two class-H amplifiers. Fitting both a tweeter and mid-woofer into the Roam rather than using one all-purpose driver should make a significant difference in audio quality.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d65cde60-80f7-11eb-b7f5-34f88a25170b" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="770d0e5a-280a-34ed-8ae7-6874cfa78ddb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>Sonos also included the “Auto Trueplay” speaker-tuning technology it first built into the Move. This means the speaker will use its built-in microphone array to listen to its output and optimize the sound for wherever it’s placed. Trueplay has been available for Sonos speakers since 2015, but they require an iOS device to use to manually tune the device. Not so for the Move and the Roam, and the Roam takes things a step further this time. It’ll be able to tune itself even when you’re not on WiFi, using profiles built directly into the speaker hardware itself.</p><p>The Roam is entering a crowded market, but it’s priced competitively, even if it’s still more expensive than many Bluetooth-only devices. It does offer a load of features if you’re already a Sonos user — but its low price also makes it a gateway drug to the Sonos ecosystem if you’ve never tried their products. We’ll need to take a listen before we can judge if Sonos hit the mark, but from what we know so far it’s looking like a compelling option in the ultraportable speaker category. Pre-orders for the Roam are open now on the Sonos website, and the speaker will be available on April 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-portable-bluetooth-wifi-speaker-specs-price-release-date-210042690.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">148da868-4e1a-4a10-ad25-910e70211e64</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615324672</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T21:18:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sonos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman lays on a blanket in the park, with a phone in one hand and the Sonos Roam speaker in the other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Roam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile will start automatically enrolling customers in an ad targeting program]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a T-Mobile subscriber, you’ll soon be automatically enrolled in a program that will see your online and device usage data sold to advertisers. In a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/privacy-center/our-practices/privacy-policy" target="_self">privacy policy update</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803" target="_self"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the carrier said it would start sharing that information with marketing agencies starting April 26th unless customers opt out. “We’ve heard many say they prefer more relevant ads so we’re defaulting to this setting,” a spokesperson for T-Mobile told the <em>WSJ</em>. The new policy will include everyone who came over to T-Mobile through the carrier’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html" target="_self">2020 merger with Sprint</a>. That’s notable because Sprint previously allowed its customers to opt into sharing their data with advertisers.</p><p>T-Mobile’s decision to enroll as many of its customers as possible in a program that sells their data to advertisers runs counter to what we’ve seen from tech giants like Google and Apple recently. It was only earlier this month the former said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ads-user-data-tracking-cookies-144445173.html" target="_self">stop selling ads</a> that rely on a person’s browsing history, and not build any cross app tracking tools in the future. Apple, meanwhile, will soon require developers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-privacy-updates-wwdc-2020-181218381.html" target="_self">explicitly obtain a person’s permission</a> before they track them across websites and applications. It’s even a step beyond the data collection AT&amp;T and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) currently run. While both carriers automatically enroll their subscribers in programs that pool them into shared interest groups, as an AT&amp;T or Verizon customer, you don’t have to go out of your way to prevent your wireless provider from sharing more detailed information on you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can opt out of the advertising program by opening the T-Mobile app on your phone, tapping the “More” tab and then going into the “Advertising &amp; Analytics” section. Switch the toggle next to the “Use my data to make ads more relevant to me” option to off.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-ad-targeting-program-205736695.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">506555d7-9662-43c6-9173-6232d4650795</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 20:57:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615323710</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T21:02:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4147b9f0-8118-11eb-8beb-73745f3cd64e" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4147b9f0-8118-11eb-8beb-73745f3cd64e" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[helen89 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York, July 19, 2018: People walking by a T Mobile store in Manhattan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[People walking by a T Mobile store in Manhattan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram starts rolling out an auto-caption sticker for Stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-live-rooms-160002273.html" target="_self">Instagram</a> is taking a step forward for accessibility with the rollout of automatic captions on Stories.

The company has made <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/soundsport-wireless.html#v=soundsport_wireless_citron" target="_self">a number</a> of them over the years, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/products/bose/soundsport-free/" target="_self">multiple</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-bose-sport-earbuds-announced-price-specs-134749642.html" target="_self">pairs</a> of true wireless buds. However, for its most recent option, Bose is taking a different approach. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-officially-unveils-its-wireless-sport-open-earbuds-144019656.html" target="_self">The Sport Open Earbuds</a> (<a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/earbuds/sport-open-earbuds.html#v=sport_open_earbuds_black" target="_self">$199.95</a>) are indeed true wireless, but they don’t have the typical ear tip that goes inside your ear canal.</p><p>Instead, as the name suggests, they have an “open” design that sits outside of your ear. Not only does this increase comfort, but it also allows you to hear what’s going on around you at all times — a key safety feature for runners. Add a sporty over-the-ear hook design and water resistance and you’ve got earbuds prepped for the gym or trail. The only question is whether you’re willing to make some sacrifices for the sake of staying in tune with your surroundings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="7f1714f6-6862-4abb-a361-2f9c53977832"/><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>Like a lot of sports buds, both wired and wireless, the Bose Sport Open Earbuds have a hook that goes over the top of your ear and down behind it. This, of course, keeps them in place while you’re moving around on a run or in the gym. And that’s even more essential with these since there’s nothing going inside your ear that would otherwise keep them from falling out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/435f47c0-80f6-11eb-bf39-03dd7d3bcd9b" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds. The company keeps your ears open to your environment while you exercise, which can increase safety for runners and other workout situations. At home, you won&#x002019;t seem like a jerk for not answering your partner while listening to a podcast. However, the design that makes the Sport Open Earbuds compelling for workouts limits performance elsewhere, so you have to accept sacrifices that could be deal breakers. " data-uuid="14f74d16-3090-3246-b782-6908de1d1eeb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The hook design keeps things stationary, but they’re made of hard plastic. They don’t offer as much comfort as a soft-touch or flexible material would. Plus, they don’t bend to adjust to the contours of your ears. You’re stuck with the exact shape Bose’s designers selected, which isn’t uncomfortable per se, but it also isn’t as comfy as it could be.</p><p>Due to the Sport Open Earbuds design, the actual “earbud” component sits at the top of your ear rather than just outside of your canal. This allows for the “open” design that keeps your ears free to hear what’s going on around you while you listen to music or podcasts. Bose has created what it calls OpenAudio technology that beams “rich, full-range sound” into your ears while reducing what others nearby might pick up. It’s a similar concept to the Bose Frames, though these earbuds position the sound source much closer to your ear. So instead of using bone conduction, the Sport Open Earbuds employ specifically placed acoustic ports that channel music to its intended destination, powered by two 16mm drivers. It sounds good on paper, but in practice, my family could easily hear noise from these even at medium volumes.</p><p>Samsung’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html" target="_self">Galaxy Buds Live</a>, also offers an “open” type design. But with those, Samsung puts the speaker directly over your ear canal. So while there’s no ear tip inside your ear, the buds are much closer, which helps with noise isolation and overall sound quality.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/be4bd3d0-80f7-11eb-bf5f-63edb0525c40" alt="Bose Sport Open Earbuds" data-uuid="7055d0ca-4533-3c3e-996f-cdb7eeff72b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>Lastly, Bose didn’t totally nix on-board controls for the Sport Open Earbuds. There are two tiny physical buttons — one on each side — that offer a few options. On the right, a single press will play/pause, a double press will skip to the next track and a triple press will return to the previous track. That same button is used to power on the earbuds and answer/end calls. The control on the left earbud activates your voice assistant of choice when you hold it down, and you can set it to announce the battery level with a single press. Thanks to a post-launch update, you can adjust volume with a tap on the outside of the earbuds. Use the right to increase volume and the left to turn it down. Bose also gives you the ability to disable volume control entirely inside of its app (it’s disabled by default).</p><p>It’s interesting that Bose employs both a physical button and touch gestures for the on-board controls on these earbuds. The tap is the less invasive action, so it would be great if the company could make some of button-pressing items touch enabled. At any rate, it’s clear Bose plans to improve the experience over time, since it’s already doing so shortly after launching the product.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/435adaf1-80f6-11eb-a6f2-375d80f64d11" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds. The company keeps your ears open to your environment while you exercise, which can increase safety for runners and other workout situations. At home, you won&#x002019;t seem like a jerk for not answering your partner while listening to a podcast.

" data-uuid="13680e39-1325-33ca-8244-a4adc7406492"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Going into this review, I had flashbacks to testing the Galaxy Buds Live. Samsung’s design choices were pretty unique and those earbuds accomplished a lot of what it set out to do. However, the audio quality just wasn’t there. Plus, the company included active noise cancellation (ANC) on a product that didn’t seal off your ears, which kind of defeated the purpose. My first experience with a set of “open” design earbuds showed me having your ears always tuned into what’s going on around you meant big sacrifices in audio quality.</p><p>That’s the case again with the Bose Sport Open Earbuds. Bose has achieved a lot of what it intended: primarily, keeping your ears unobstructed when you’re exercising. There’s no denying this has massive implications for safety, especially for runners. But, I could overhear plenty at home while testing these. And, if your gym is anything like the one I went to pre-pandemic, it blasts a variety of pop music at an unreasonable volume. The main reason I wore headphones was to block that out, and these Bose earbuds won’t help you much there. You also have to be aware that these aren’t going to give you the audio quality you’ll likely be looking for in a set of $200 earbuds. That’s especially true when it comes to low-end.</p><p>While the Sport Open Earbuds have decent clarity, the lack of bassy thump sucks a lot of energy out of songs that are otherwise big and boomy. And if you’re like me, you rely on an ample amount of low-end to keep you motivated during a workout. With these earbuds, you get plenty of treble and some mid-range but that’s about it. This means they’re great for podcasts but just okay for most genres of music.</p><section data-eng-breakout="25c5cc377031406397aac944d9afa7a3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/6133d150-80f9-11eb-bf6f-98130e92cea6" alt="Bose Sport Open earbuds" data-uuid="27b79b4e-779c-34a3-a239-40e921674947"></section><p>For example, the drum machines and percussion on Com Truise’s synth-heavy instrumentals retain detail, but the songs just don’t have the depth and droning bass lines that make them so atmospheric. The discrepancy is even more noticeable with hip-hop tracks like Lil Baby’s “Heatin Up.” The beat that’s the backbone of the track fades into the background.</p><p>The open design also has a benefit for calls: you can chat without feeling like you have to yell to hear yourself. Like podcasts, call audio comes through the earbuds crisp and clear. However, the person on the other side noted I sounded only slightly better than a speakerphone and background noise was an issue. They also said that they could hear themselves coming through — likely because the earbud mics were picking up sound from the open speakers.</p><h2><strong>Software features</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/43597b61-80f6-11eb-85c1-a8fbe3de5839" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="0749f65a-1e33-310c-8193-5bf8c1cdbbc7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>A lot of headphone companies offer the ability to use audio presets, manually tweak the EQ or customize on-board controls with an app. That’s not an option Bose gives you with the Sport Open Earbuds. Instead, the app primarily handles software updates and monitors battery levels. There is one handy item in relation to charging: the app knows when the earbuds are on the base and displays progress.</p><p>Like most earbud and headphone apps, it also reminds you what the controls do, but that’s really it. It’s clear Bose wanted to keep things simple here, but that comes at the expense of literally any degree of customization.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Bose claims up to eight hours of battery life on the Sport Open Earbuds. During my tests, I actually managed slightly better, stretching them about 30 minutes longer than the stated figure. This listening time is slightly above average for true wireless earbuds these days, but there’s a catch: these buds don’t come with a charging case. You don’t have a place to constantly top off the battery in your pocket when you’re taking a break from tunes. It also means there are separate accessories for charging and for storage.</p><p>Bose includes a magnetic charging base with a USB cable that connects to either your computer or a plug you likely already have. The Sport Open Earbuds fully charge in two hours, and 30 minutes will give you three hours of playback. Lights on the outside of the earbuds pulse white during charging and remain solid when done. The company also put a hard shell carrying case in the box. It’s not the fanciest thing, but it gets the job done. And a magnetic closure should keep them from falling out if the case gets jostled around in your bag.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><section data-eng-breakout="a39844ab1ff045dd8fa61703666e526d" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/664fdf00-80f7-11eb-bbfe-2623c5b8e2fd" alt="Bose Frames" data-uuid="ae369f4e-d894-3f53-885a-3bfa13b337be"></section><p>Bose actually offers some solid competition for the Sport Open Earbuds within its own product lines. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-bose-sport-earbuds-announced-price-specs-134749642.html" target="_self">The Bose Sport Earbuds</a> are a more traditional true wireless product, with ear tips and fit wings to keep things in place and block out noise. They lack the company’s powerful ANC and they’re quite big, but the sound quality is solid and they’re cheaper at $179.95.</p><p>As I mentioned, if you’re a fan of the “open” wear style, Bose also offers it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html" target="_self">with sunglasses</a>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-three-new-frames-131152809.html" target="_self">The Bose Frames Tempo</a> are specially designed for exercise and sports, though the company does have options for “regular” use. The sport model offers eight hours of battery life and better water resistance, but they’re also one of the priciest options at $249.95 (some models are $50 cheaper). All of the audio sunglasses have swappable lenses, some are even prescription friendly, and they keep your ears tuned in to what’s going on around you.</p><p>For non-Bose alternatives, I’d actually suggest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html" target="_self">the Galaxy Buds Live</a> from Samsung. Like the Sport Open Earbuds, these don’t have an ear tip and sit outside of your ear canal. However, they’re positioned <em>just </em>at the outside of the opening, rather than above it. This ensures better sound quality while still keeping things comfy and allowing ambient noise through. I’m not a big fan of them overall, but if a set of “open” earbuds are what you’re after, they’re worth a look. As of this writing, they’re $130 on Amazon (regularly $170).</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4359f091-80f6-11eb-bfbe-53a078ec1319" alt="Bose definitely achieves what it set out to do with its latest true wireless earbuds. The company keeps your ears open to your environment while you exercise, which can increase safety for runners and other workout situations. At home, you won&#x002019;t seem like a jerk for not answering your partner while listening to a podcast. However, the design that makes the Sport Open Earbuds compelling for workouts limits performance elsewhere, so you have to accept sacrifices that could be deal breakers.

The company may be mostly known for its noise-cancelling chops, but overall audio quality has also been respectable. With the Sport Open Earbuds, Bose decided allowing you to be hyper aware of everything around you was paramount. This means you gain the comfort of not having something crammed in your ears, but you have to accept sacrifices to sound quality.</p><p>I can appreciate these earbuds have a very specific purpose, and they could be a solid compliment to a set of over-ear noise-cancelling headphones that allow you to tune in and tune out the world. Of course, that’s the wrinkle: Do you want to invest in two sets of headphones or earbuds? There are plenty of all-around options that are well-suited for both casual listening and exercise. You’ll just have to decide if keeping your ears open is more important than great sound quality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bose-sport-open-earbuds-review-180058380.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a727045-80ba-42bb-9d27-bf42bfaebcda</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615313251</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T18:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d8aac600-80f7-11eb-b37e-4cd2d54b4a5f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d8aac600-80f7-11eb-b37e-4cd2d54b4a5f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bose Sport Open Earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bose Sport Open Earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome OS is getting a big redesign for its 10th birthday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the 10th birthday of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html" target="_self">Chrome OS</a>, Google is <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/chromebook-turns-10-new-features" target="_self">announcing a revamp today</a> and a new set of tools to make the platform much more useful. Of note, it&#39;s adding a new clipboard that remembers the last five things you copied, a Phone Hub to make accessing your Android device easier and support for Nearby Share.</p><p>Phone Hub is a little dashboard that lets you access your phone&#39;s controls and see its status for things like battery life and data connectivity. Not only can you use your Chromebook to ring your Android device when you&#39;ve misplaced it, you can also enable tethering with one click as well as see recent Chrome tabs on your phone. You&#39;ll continue to be able to send and receive texts from the laptop (which you could already do before with the Messages app).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Two new features make life a bit easier for those who have Android and Chrome OS devices. First, WiFi sync will let you automatically connect to trusted networks that you&#39;ve used on your phone or other Chromebooks without having to re-enter passwords. And in the coming months, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-nearby-share-specs-availability-160054637.html" target="_self">Nearby Share</a> is coming to enable file sharing between your Chromebook and other Chrome OS or Android devices without an internet connection (over Bluetooth or local WiFi).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/2ae373d0-80fe-11eb-a7fd-56046061091e" style="height:1024;width:1344;" alt="Chrome OS 10th birthday update images Phone Hub" data-uuid="22741cdf-ffb5-3f67-9c95-2f4a1ccc5bdd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google is also boosting the screen capture tool in Chrome OS, making it easier to access from the Quick Settings panel. You can now outline exactly what you want to copy on your display, and create screen recording videos, which will all be saved to your clipboard. Speaking of, the clipboard can now store up to five things you&#39;ve copied, and you can access them from the new Tote feature. This is a holding zone for all the files you and Google think you&#39;ll need, in addition to the screen captures. You can pin files to Totes for easy access, which should come in handy for things your frequently send like checklists or reference sheets.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of the redesign, Google is integrating media controls directly into the Quick Settings panel for easier access and refreshing the icons for built-in apps. Sharing files, images and links between apps and your browser is becoming slightly easier — now when you click Share on supported websites, you&#39;ll see a list of apps you can send your content to directly. When you want to translate, define or convert something on your screen, right-clicking it will bring up Quick Answers in a panel so you won&#39;t need to open another tab.</p><p>The company is also updating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-google-chrome-os-78.html" target="_self">the Desks feature</a> by adding support for up to eight virtual workspaces and bringing a new Overview mode to make switching between them easier. Now, when your laptop reboots, your windows in various Desks will restore so you can quickly get set back up in your workflow again.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a7c6b1b0-80fd-11eb-beff-7e8f6ff6bac6" style="height:1024;width:1344;" alt="Chrome OS 10th birthday update images support for up to eight Desks and a new overview mode" data-uuid="3b70ca52-2f03-3f21-a7bf-47f9c2215c61"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Select-to-speak, the Chrome OS screen reader, is getting improved controls including options to pause, speed up and slow down the playback. Google is also making it easier to skip to different sections of text.&nbsp;</p><p>Since many parents are buying their kids Chromebooks to make homework easier, Google is also making it simpler to set up Family Link, which allows students to use school accounts on their own devices. This way, parental controls can still apply while children get access to their school&#39;s apps.&nbsp;</p><p>With Chromebooks being the most popular laptop in schools, it&#39;s good to see some useful updates coming to the platform. For those of us on Windows (or even those on macOS), some of these features will seem more like Google bringing its desktop software closer to what we&#39;re familiar with. Chrome OS may still not be the productivity ecosystem for people who need powerful apps for work, but with these updates it appears to be starting to catch up.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e0dc9488-7fff-4954-a4bc-424a0f901cc3"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chrome-os-10-anniversary-redesign-phone-hub-180011118.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afefddd4-8d7a-40d4-a7e5-de1ba431bdeb</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615314497</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T18:28:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/472b09e0-8103-11eb-bffb-e7bbbdc43c00" width="1344" height="909" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/472b09e0-8103-11eb-bffb-e7bbbdc43c00" width="1344" height="909" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chrome OS 10th birthday update]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Chrome OS 10th birthday update]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter sues Texas AG alleging political retaliation for Trump ban]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter isn&#39;t happy that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation into the company after it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-banned-from-twitter-232502274.html" target="_self">banned former President Trump</a>. <em>CBS News</em><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-sues-texas-ag-ken-paxton-claiming-he-retaliated-after-it-banned-trump/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&amp;linkId=112970055" target="_self">reports</a> Twitter has sued Paxton in federal court, alleging the AG is violating the First Amendment by trying to punish the social network for exercising free speech rights over the content it hosts. Paxton was using the &quot;full weight&quot; of his position as retaliation over editorial choices he didn&#39;t like, Twitter&#39;s attorneys said.</p><p>Paxton himself had claimed Twitter&#39;s ban &quot;chills free speech&quot; and accused multiple tech giants of a &quot;seemingly coordinated deplatforming&quot; of Trump following the Capitol riot. He echoed frequent conservative beliefs that Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facbook-donald-trump-joe-biden-155849567.html" target="_self">Facebook</a>, Google and others are breaking the spirit of the First Amendment with an alleged bias against right-wing views. These sites should be treated as public spaces and forced to carry any otherwise legal content, according to these beliefs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter may have a solid case, however. As a private company, Twitter is within its rights to determine what it does and doesn&#39;t publish.

The initial result of that massive investment has now hit the streets in the form of a compact crossover SUV. Say hello to the 2021 ID.4, VW’s first EV for the people.</p><p>The ID.4’s on-paper stats aren’t particularly striking, especially when compared to some of its higher-priced, luxury alternatives. With a 77.0-kWh lithium-ion battery pack putting out 201 HP and 229 pound-feet of torque, the ID.4’s specs are very much in line with its gas model equivalents like the Honda CRV or similarly specced EVs like the Hyundai Kona or Kia Niro EV (though each of those only have 64 kwH batteries).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ID.4 tips scales at 4,600-plus pounds. Yeah, that’s stout, even for an electric and it’s roughly 800 pounds heavier than the biggest 2021 Kona EV. As such, you shouldn’t be surprised that the EV crossover takes its sweet time getting up to 60 mph in around seven and a half seconds, which is pretty pokey for an EV. Even when overtaking other vehicles at freeway speeds, the ID.4 can feel downright lackadaisical. Combined with a governed top speed of 100 MPH, the ID.4 is very much a people mover, not a sports car in disguise.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/5d3899c0-80f7-11eb-827b-cc98bd33e4c9" alt="A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships." data-uuid="b2c95689-5c3d-33a9-85a9-b787c2d80c09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>Its EPA estimated 250-mile range feels generous and seems very much geared towards urban errands and freeway commutes with ready access to charging stations. Even when using the electron-sipping Economy mode to cruise along a nearly empty Highway 280 outside San Francisco, the power gauge shrank far more quickly than I was comfortable with. This was the first EV I’ve test driven where I’ve felt a bit of palpable range anxiety. Thankfully, the ID.4’s 400V electrical architecture supports both level 2 and DC fast charging protocols which enable it to imbibe an 80 percent charge in, respectively, around 9.5 hours and just under 40 minutes (per VW’s estimates).</p><p>Style-wise, I find myself smitten with the ID.4. The crossover’s exterior is less windswept than last year’s Honda HRV but not as rigidly straight-edged as Volvo’s upcoming C40 Recharge. And unlike what we saw on the Mach-E, e-tron GT or even the XC40 Recharge, the ID.4 appears to use surprisingly muted head and tail lights — you won’t find any Thor’s Hammers bedazzling the hood or distended brakelights climbing the trunk lid like LED ivy. Kind of a shame, really.</p><p>The interior is sparse. But, I guess, no more sparse than any of the other last few EVs I’ve recently been in? Honestly, They all feel sterile and minimalist to me, if only to varying degrees. In this case, the dashboard of the ID.4 comprises two LED displays, a smattering of steering column stalks and some AC vents.</p><p>The gear shift is located on the steering column as well and it’s weird  — basically a wide paddle mounted on the column and capped with a parking brake button. You twist it back and forth to change between forward and reverse gears. I mean, I wasn’t initially a fan of the Mach-E’s cylindrical iDrive-style shifter but at least it didn’t take me 5 minutes just to identify the damn thing the first time I got into the car. Same with the Start button. I haven&#39;t thought to look for a start button on the steering column itself since the days of physical ignition cylinders. Touche, Volkswagen.</p><p>Despite the confusing nature of various sticks, stalks and buttons, the cabin itself is really quite comfortable. It’s roomy enough for five grown adults to fit in without having to slouch in the back seat, plus the perceived headroom and vertical space is accentuated by an all-glass roof. Unlike the Mach-E, the ID.4’s roof is much less opaque and is instead concealed from external prying eyes by a rollaway cloth headliner which slides out of the way at the swipe of an overhead touch control. The trunk space is equally well appointed with 30 cubic feet of space that more than doubles if you lower the rear seat backs.</p><p>The infotainment system, however, is like if 2020 were digital cabin controls. I’ve yet to encounter such a system with a steeper initial learning curve. The menu system feels like it was designed via dare. Upon taking delivery of the vehicle I was auditorily assaulted with adult contemporary music for an unconscionable span of time while I tried in vain to locate a power button, a pause button — hell, even the volume controls — in what proved to be VW’s byzantine infotainment menu system. And for that I will never forgive you, Michael Bolton. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DID, MICHAEL.</p><div><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFood_bTOX4?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Thank goodness for a robust voice control system combined with integration for both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to enable more seamless control of the cabin environment. But note that these aren’t fully integrated like what you’d see on the XC40 Recharge or the Polestar 2 with Android Auto — those operate directly through the infotainment system head unit.</p><p>The ID.4 does bear a passing resemblance to the Tesla Model Y, and I like that, it’s just tall enough to provide a clear view of the traffic around me without feeling top-heavy — the thousand pounds of battery pack under my seat certainly helps with that. The suspension is strung tightly enough to keep the ID.4 from body-rolling through turns while remaining soft enough that driving over potholes wouldn’t jar my spine out of alignment.</p><p>Oddly, I could seem to find a one-pedal driving option. One-pedal driving is a system found in EVs that uses the accelerator pedal to modulate both the vehicle’s drive and braking — press down on the pedal to go faster, ease off it to automatically engage the regenerative brakes and recoup precious charge. I personally am not a fan of the method but its absence from a vehicle so clearly designed as a practical family commuter is both noticeable and notable.</p><p>The ID.4’s ADAS system, IQ.DRIVE, works generally as you’d expect it would. It offers the standard mix of forward collision warning, autonomous emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, rear traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control. In my limited experience with it, I found the lane keeping feature demanded an iron will to engage as the vehicle kept seeming to delay recentering itself within the lane until it was already riding the side marker. It’s certainly no hands-free steering like what GM’s SuperCruise feature offers, but this is helpful when you&#39;re in traffic and trying to fight through infotainment menus.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/5d44cec0-80f7-11eb-ac8a-b7d9ba2977c6" alt="A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships." data-uuid="9ed885c6-f9a5-3cda-a4ee-9dc42dc43806"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Andrew Tarantola / Engadget</div></figure><p>The ID.4 starts at around $40,000 and comes available in three trim packages, the Pro, the Pro S and the 1st edition. All three are currently only available as RWD though the Pro and Pro S will begin offering an AWD version later this year as a $4,000 option. Specifically, the 1st Edition, which I drove, starts at $43,995, the Pro will put you back $40-44,000 depending on drive type and the Pro S (the S stands for Statement) will start at $44-48K with the option to upgrade to 19-inch rims and a 12-inch infotainment display for an added $1,500.</p><p>Overall, the ID.4 is a solid first attempt at an EV. Sure Volkswagen included a few… ahem, unusual design decisions, it’s range and power consumption were twitchy enough to keep my eyes glued to the battery gauge during my drive, and the whole vehicle in general felt just a touch under-powered. But this is the first of what we expect will be many more EV models from the automaker. I’d personally wait a model year or two for everything to fully shakedown and for VW to work all the bugs out but if you’re in the market for a sensible mass-market EV that can shuttle your family around town, carry home a full load of groceries, and perform all those other innocuous errands that used to fill our days before the pandemic hit, the 2021 ID.4 is well worth your consideration.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83a896ad-d8c1-4506-8100-78d8f1e528cc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 16:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615308859</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T16:54:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/ed759bb0-80f6-11eb-9ded-9ae2b6117e22" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/ed759bb0-80f6-11eb-9ded-9ae2b6117e22" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A blue Volkswagen ID.4 EV is parked in a lot right next to San Francisco docks with military ships.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Volkswagen ID.4 EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This Alexa-enabled smart ring light from GE is on sale for 55 percent off]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As impressive as Amazon’s Alexa technology is, the best way to utilize it isn’t always clear. Sure, you can get it to tell you the weather, play music and set alarms, but that’s just scratching the surface of what this AI is truly capable of. And if you never get around to purchasing and syncing compatible peripherals, you won&#39;t get to explore much further than that.</p><p>If you haven’t quite been sold on voice-activated tech yet, or simply want to up the ante a spell, it&#39;s absolutely worth checking out the <a href="https://deals.gdgt.com/sales/ge-c-by-ge-sol-wifi-alexa-enabled-smart-light?utm_source=engadget.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ge-c-by-ge-sol-wifi-alexa-enabled-smart-light&amp;utm_term=scsf-475294&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004ZFWdQAO&amp;scsonar=1" target="_self"><ins>GE C by GE Sol</ins></a>, an Alexa-enabled smart light that’s available right now for just $90 (normally $199). It has Amazon Alexa built right into it, so it serves a direct function in addition to having such a charming voice.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This smart light has all the features, functionality and control you&#39;d expect from Amazon Alexa — only it’s packed into an innovative Richard Clarkson-inspired design. Speaking of which, this device fits in perfectly with your contemporary (or even traditional) space with its smooth, polished steel frame and soft, cozy lighting.</p><p>Part of the brilliance of the design is how it synchronizes its own aesthetic with the Alexa technology. Not only can you set alarms, but you can sync them with the light to emit something called “vibration lighting” in the morning to help wake you up, or “calming light” in the evening to help you unwind.</p><p>You can also set it to passively transition from daylight lighting to soft white shade in the evening, helping maintain your circadian rhythm without even thinking about it. And, of course, it’s compatible with all the Alexa-friendly smart home devices you already own (or just have your eye on).</p><p>If you’re looking for a sophisticated way to add smart voice functionality and lighting to any room in your home, you can purchase a <a href="https://deals.gdgt.com/sales/ge-c-by-ge-sol-wifi-alexa-enabled-smart-light?utm_source=engadget.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ge-c-by-ge-sol-wifi-alexa-enabled-smart-light&amp;utm_term=scsf-475294&amp;utm_content=a0x1P000004ZFWdQAO&amp;scsonar=1" target="_self"><ins>GE C by GE Sol Wi-Fi Alexa Enabled Smart Light</ins></a> on sale for $90, or 55 percent off.</p><p><em>Prices are subject to change.</em></p><p><em>Engadget is teaming up with </em><a href="https://stacksocial.com/?aid=a-fbjjc6kk" target="_self"><em><ins>StackSocial</ins></em></a><em> to bring you deals on the latest headphones, gadgets, tech toys, and tutorials.
